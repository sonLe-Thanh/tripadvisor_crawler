France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Complete surprise,"We had no expectations for this Signac exhibition within Musee d""Orsay and were taken by surprise by the expansive layout, educational element, quality of his works but also the interplay and influence of contemporary artist like Seurat Pissarro and Henri Edmond Cross","Written November 23, 2021"

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Superb museum,"Every time we visit Paris, this museum is always included as a must see. I would recommend booking tickets online. The visitor will be allotted a 30 minute window of time to visit. The lines are usually quite long to buy same day tickets. For US visitors, it is necessary to show the CDC vaccination card prior to entry.
The museum was originally a train station in 1900. In 1977, the building was transformed into a world class museum.
The fifth floor has exceptional paintings from Degas, Monet, Renoir, Seurat, Pissarro and Cezanne.
Third floor has unique examples of Art Nouveau.
Gift shops are scattered throughout the museum.
Ticket price is a very reasonable $16.",

This is my second time in Paris and I went back and fourth about possibly going back to the Louvre for the second time since I didn‚Äôt finish it but I‚Äôm glad I went to Musee d‚ÄôOrsay instead since I was only in Paris for 2 days. The cafe on the top floor also had amazing coffee!",

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Favorite museum in Paris!,"The Orsay is a wonderful museum in a beautiful old train station on the Seine. It has a light, bright calm feeling where you can enjoy the art. The Impressionist collection is the star. I suggest to start on the top floor (by the giant clock face) and work your way down). It's great to go on Thursday evenings when they are open until 9:45pm and there are less people.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Very nice Museum,"I was a little bit skeptical of this museum since i am not a big impressionist fan. I was wrong. This is a fabulous museum. It's really big so if you have limited time focus on the masters - Van goth, Monet, Renior etc,.. When we were there they had most of their paintings on the 5th floor but there was also a special exhibit on the first floor with some really cool stuff as well. Van Goth's Starry Night alone is worth the price of admission.
Go early - we had skip the line tickets for 9:30 am on Sunday and the crowd was light. By the tome we left around 1 the museum was pretty full.

However our 14 yr old daughter was denied entry on the basis her Covid test was taken in the U.K not in France, despite it stating it was recognised in the EU and taken within the specified 72 hours.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,beautiful old building with some famous art,"After traveling via the red eye to Paris, we decided to push through the jetlag and use the afternoon to sightsee. The museum is open late so we decided to go there. There are works from several famous painters including Manet, Monet, Cezanne, etc. Housed in a beautiful old building along the Seine, there is plenty to see here..... perhaps too much. Wander through the gallerys that interest you and move along. There is likely too much here to see everything. Recommended","Written October 14, 2021"

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Probably Our Favorite Paris Museum,"Not as good a selection of art as on our last visit, we missed some of the things we liked, but it's still worth a tour, if you like the impressionists and some truly lovely sculpture.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Great Museum - Worth Cost of Entry - Fascinating Arts,"d'Orsay is smaller and generally less crowded than the Louvre, but whereas the Louvre probably takes a couple of visits to completely view, Musee d'Orsay is easier to view in a few hours - this was my impression on a first time visit in September, however, I think one of the floors was closed temporarily. The works displayed here are fantastic and generally more accessible than the Louvre on a crowded day.","Written September 19, 2021"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Great 1/2 day Museum Experience!,"We chose to visit the Musee d'Orsay in Paris rather than one of the larger museums, like the Louvre. We spent about 3 hours wandering through the many rooms and halls of beautiful sculptures, paintings, and fascinating exhibits. The famous Monet and Van Gogh painting were absolutely gorgeous! When we left, we felt like we saw a lot, but were not totally overwhelmed. Beautiful old building as well. Amazing how the old train station was converted into an excellent space for a museum. Great experience!","Written September 18, 2021"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Spectacular venue,"This spectacular old train station and its art collection are indeed better than Louvre. Wish I had read earlier review and started on fifth floor because by the time we got there and walked out for a magnificent view across the Seine, we were pooped from climbing, standing and listening to too much audio guide. A personal guide might be better.","Written September 16, 2021"

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,The best art museum in Paris.,"1. It was my 5th time in Paris and I still think that it's the best art museum in Paris. Of course if you like impressionism ;)

2. The best pictures of impressionists and postimpressionists are here like Manet, Monet, Van Gogh, Renoir, Deags, Gauguin.

3. There is sculpture also, mainly on the ground floor.

4. Important for parents! Children have free entry and for you as a parent price is reduced (you pay 13 Euro, not 16 Euro).

5. Moving around is also quite easy. It's not so easy to get lost like in other museums of Paris.","Written September 10, 2021"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Amazing Collection,"This is the finest collection of Impressionist Art in the world, I believe. Buy your tickets for an early entrance as the Museum gets crowded even in Covid times. The audioguide is well done and worth the cost. But don‚Äôt try to listen to every available work or you will be exhausted before seeing all the highlights. Start at the top since that is the most popular and becomes crowded. There is an outdoor space near the coffee shop that was a good place to take a break and enjoy the Paris skyline. If you only go to one museum besides the Louvre, make it this one!","Written September 9, 2021"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Full of Impressionist art!,"This museum has a truly massive collection. If you like Impressionist art this is where you want to go. Paintings by Monet and Renoir as well as a number of original Van Gogh works grace the walls everywhere you look. My personal favorite are the massive paintings that can be found on the bottom floor. I believe that the first Sunday of the month is free and there are a few other discounts that you can get. They are listed on the website. All in all, this place is worth a visit if you appreciate good art.","Written September 8, 2021"

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Iconic paintings,"There are few iconic paintings that anyone, from anywhere, from any age and from any culture, can recognise. The Musee d'Orsay has all of them. The incredible value of this museum is all there. You saw them in postcards, school books, social meme, on TV, everywhere (!), here you'll see them for real and they're breathtaking. A thorough visit may take 2-3 hours, but to see the world-known masterpieces, one hour and a half may well be enough. Top floor, plus some paintings hidden on the lower floors... go find them ;-) Don't miss Rodin's Gates of Hell. PS: 5th visit to date.","Written September 8, 2021"

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,The photo of the exterior of the Musee d'Orsay !,"The exterior of the Musee d'Orsay is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful buildings in Paris. The imposing building was built in 1900 and sits on the left bank of the River Seine. The original use of the building was for a railroad station. The Musee has a second building attached in the back. In the photo, you can see the half-circle exterior of the other building. Attached is a photo of the interior of the half-circle building.

As you look at this photo, the entrance is around the corner of the right side of the building. The stunning photo also includes a church (Basilica of Saint Clotide) and the ""Les Invalides"" building (with gold dome) which includes Napoleon's Tomb and the the beautiful chapel.

Don't miss the fifth floor which includes the Impressionist section. Enjoy !",
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Outstanding!,"A super collection of impressionist paintings! The reservation process (required until mid September) was easy to use.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Absolute must see if you like Impressionism,I enjoy the Musee d'Orsay so much that I've visited it multiple times. The entire collection is impressive but the impressionist collection is especially wonderful. The size of the museum is large enough without feeling overwhelming and the atmosphere is very cool. My tip would be to go early and start on the top floors (impressionist and post-impressionist collection) and you will have considerably fewer crowds.,"Written August 29, 2021"

But just like IKEA, it seems, expect to have to go through everything to get where you want to go. Fantastic museum, even for just the architecture. Plenty of the impressionists' and post impressionists' work on display here. Allow plenty of time. Free cloakroom. Audio guides are good but it seems there isn't commentary on a lot in the museum - all the important ones have some commentary. Overall, a wonderful Museum.",

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Extraordinary - from a golden ancient era - building!!,"What used to be a railway station and a hotel has now turned into a museum. Such an impressive building, which was built on a golden era, where the architects surely took the extra step in designing an over the top building.

This is a must see while in Paris, not only because of the amazing art collections it features from time to time, but also as an architectural monument, a piece of art by itself! Lovely to observe from the outside at all times of the day and night throughout the year.",
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Even the teen loved it.,"I like the size compared to the Louvre. Like most of the museums in Paris, the building is beautiful. There's a lot to look at, spent 3 hours inside. We went on the first Sunday of the month, which is free (but you still need to make a reservation). It was more crowded than I thought, but it was the free day.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Better hygiene needed,"Excellent museum, for sure.....
YET in this review, I'd like to nudge museum administration about the quality of toilet facilities -- the 3 women's toilets on the 6th floor (yes, only 3) were poorly equipped (all missing paper).

For a popular, top-notch Paris museum open to the public who pay for the privilege of entering,it is ""la moindre des choses"" to offer a decent standard of hygiene to those who come to the museum.","Written July 1, 2021"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,One of my favorite museums,"Museum is really fantastic. I was so impressed of such a big magic collection of the biggest painters and artists.

The collection of art nouveau furniture is greater than anything I have ever seen and the collection of impressionist work is the most impressive point for my visit.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Why is Orsay better than the Louvre?,"The Paris commune of 1871, the world's fair of 1900, and President Pompidou contributed to the creation of Orsay. The Orsay Palace burned down during the Commune. The Paris-Orleans railway station was built for the world's fair. When the station became indecently small for long post-war trains, it was decided to demolish it. However, the successor of the legendary de Gaulle, President Pompidou, decided to save it and supported the project of creating a Museum here. The Museum was given its former name, and the monstrous Museum of modern art was named after Pompidou. Pompidou did not wait for the opening of the Museum and died, and the Orsay Museum was opened 16 years later, not even under his successor Giscard d‚Äô√âstaing, and in the time of Mitterrand. The French conquerors and millionaires collected so many works of art that there was no Museum of suitable size, so they were divided into 3: the Louvre, the Orsay and the Pompidou. Orsay inherited art from the revolution of 1848 to the beginning of the first world war in 1914. The Louvre contained all the art before the European revolution. Its collection is huge and filled with world masterpieces, but there is one cardinal advantage of the Orsay over the Louvre in the eyes of tourists. You can get to Orsay for free throughout the year on the first Sunday of the month, and to the Louvre only on Bastille day on July 14! There is a difference. The Orsay Museum is difficult to see in one visit, so it's worth setting priorities. However, the Louvre can not be viewed in principle. After waiting in line for an hour and a half on the first Sunday, you get to the first floor in the Central hall filled with sculptures, where there are many sculptures of Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux. Paintings of Ingres and Delacroix Romantica is a side gallery on the right. The realists millet and Courbet are in the gallery opposite. The main hits here are Millet's ""The Gleaners"" and two paintings by Courbet, a revolutionary in life (a member of the Paris commune) and in painting ""A Burial At Ornans""and ""tThe Origin of the World "". The revolutionary nature of the ""A Burial At Ornans"" is that in the multi-figure composition Courbet showed not historical figures or religious figures, but ordinary peasants. The Origin of the World is striking even now in the age of porn sites. The artist's irony is embedded in the title of the picture, because the female vagina is frontally depicted on it. 2 years ago, the hypothesis that the model on the canvas is Courbet's mistress was refuted. From the correspondence of Alexander Dumas-son with George Sand, it turned out that the model was a Parisian dancer-concubine of a Turkish diplomat. He was the customer of the scandalous picture. On the second floor of Orsay, separate from the impressionist halls, there are works by van Gogh with his famous self-Portrait and Gauguin with his bronzy juicy Tahitians. The third and fourth floors are filled with objects of decorative and applied art in the art Nouveau style. I missed them. Sofas and massive clocks do not cause me artistic awe, but as the French say: Don`t argue about tastes and colors. And finally, the fifth floor is the most important. This is where the most exciting collection of Impressionists Degas, Manet, Seurat, Sisley, Pizarro, Toulouse-Lautrec, Monet and Renoir are located. Drowning in Impressionists don't forget to look at Paris from the top of the observation deck on the roof of the Museum through the clock. To plunge again...",

If I had one suggestion for the museum it would be to have something that would make the museum more child-friendly (scavenger hunt - in each room, find the painting with the woman wearing a red hat, find the painting with the spotted dog, etc.) to ensure children remain engaged. If children remain engaged their parents can more fully enjoy the museum and gamification is a great way in which to drive people/children to action. Provide a button to all children who complete the challenge.",

Visited with teenage daughter who did not approve of all the nudity in the paintings & no amount of explaining about technique would appease her!

As of July 2020, it‚Äôs far quieter than normal and Covid precautions are mainly limited to masks. I‚Äôm assuming some of the individual areas may have restrictions on numbers that are lower than normal but the Tissot exhibit was the equivalent of a London gallery ‚Äúmid week busy‚Äù - not bad but as busy as you‚Äôd want without queuing to see pieces.

There are building works in some parts of the gallery - the signage is generally ok but at times misleading. If anything the areas that are closed help focus on the other (probably better) collections!","Written July 25, 2020"

Unfortunately my son and I only had a bit of time to eat lunch at the museum because we had to meet a group for our next tour.
**Keep in mind this exhibit was on display last May 2019 a year before this injustice happening in American in 2020. This just makes me even sadder I didn‚Äôt get to see these masterpieces; artists from from G√©ricault to Matisse and get pics.
The restaurant in the museum is upstairs and also has an awesome display of colorful glass art. As a food blogger my only excuse for not getting pics is we were in a rush. From what I remember I had a simple salad and ordered my 6 year old (now 7) had a burger and fries.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Great museum in a unique venue,"We stopped by here as part of our morning while planning to do some other sightseeing in the afternoon. We had already visited the Louvre in which we spent about half the day exploring all there was to see. Because of this, we weren‚Äôt quite sure what to expect and if we‚Äôd be in for another long day. The museum is located just across the river from the Louvre surrounded by small streets which would make you not notice it at first. It originally served as a train station and was eventually turned into a museum later on. While keeping with the theme of a train station the layout of the museum is very different and at times confusing. Nevertheless, it is great to see how this building was repurposed and still kept the intiial charm. This museum is much easier to get through and offers plenty to see over several floors. The top floor also offers some great views of the surrounding city including the giant clock which perfectly frames the basilica in the distance. If we had to choose, the Louvre would be our top pick but this was also great to stop by since it was included in our Klook museum pass that we had purchased for 22 USD for 48 hours of access to a long list of sites in Paris!

Really loved the art pieces - lots of Van Gogh and Monet, it is a once in a lifetime must-see. The place is well laid-out and spacious. You can easily spend half a day there with the amount of art pieces to see.",
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Eye-catching,"Once a railway station this is now an art gallery. It was completed in 1900, we didn't go into it but passed it on a bus tour.",

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Must visit for Impressionists,"The building itself is awe-inspiring and grand, being an old train station. Renaissance paintings and sculptures on the ground floor.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,a must,"In previous trips to Paris, the Musee d'Orsay was our first stop. Even if it was ""just"" a train station, it would be worthwhile.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,"Lovely building, expensive entry","Restored former railway station with numerous quirky features - such as being able to see the inside of a number of huge clocks. Very expensive entrance fee with no discount for seniors. Good selection of impressionists; a bit hard to find some of the galleries as they are tucked away in small rooms, but that is inevitable given the kind of building it is. Beautiful restaurant, but if you want to book you have to pay in advance - so we didn't use it.","Written March 17, 2020"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Great Idea.,This long structure overlooking the Siene River was a railway station build in 1900 and was then converted to a museum in 1986 after it was decided to restore the buiding rather than to demolish it after the railway station was moved. There are many preserved paintings and art works. The clock at the centre of the building is noteworthy.,"Written March 17, 2020"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Free Sunday at Musee d'Orsay,"What a wonderful museum. Airy, bright, good restaurant, amazing collection. We attended on the first Sunday of the month and spent the entire day being delighted. The Post-impressionist collection is stellar. After that the other paintings seem a little dull and conservative, but there are gems scattered throughout the museum. It is well laid out and the floor plan / map is excellent, so you can always track down what you are wanting to see. And if you can't the very obliging staff will go out of their way to help you. Do not forget to check out the Art Nouveau collection.",

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,A wonderful museum!,"One of the best things to do in Paris, plenty or art pieces, sculptures and paintings. I loved the section about symbolism and impressionism and I also discovered some great artists of the past that I didn't know.
We bought a combo ticket with Orangerie Museum included but unfortunately this was closed the day after (exceptional closing, no further info about the reason) and we couldn't visit it. But even only the Orsay is definitely worth the visit and the price.","Written March 14, 2020"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,It is just as well the art is worth the effort to get in,"The art and furniture etc on show are stunning, magnificent and a million other wonderful words to describe what is in store inside. It is an impressionists dream. While the art and furniture etc cannot be faulted the entry process and the crowd size and behaviour is terrible.
WE had priority tickets to get in and while there was a huge crowd trying to get in, we noted that the line for people who had just bought tickets got in at the same time we with prioity ( and costly) tickets gained nothing.
The crowds were huge so look at what is on when you plan to go.
on the ground floor everyone go into this sidestep pattern so we all moved along together doing a side step , but had people pushing in to take selfies, with the art as a poor mans backdrop.
It may sound as if I had a poor time , but I did not. Certainly people's behaviour was rude etc but the use of the old station and the space provided was clever and allowed you to get away from the crowd and enjoy the experience with other works. Spend a day and you will still not see it all","Written March 13, 2020"

He would not give an explanation other than to tell everyone the ""Reserved Ahead"" access C line was only for ""cardholders."" We waited 2 hours and ended up with less than an hour to tour the museum. Along with Chinese & South Korean visitors who were coughing all over the place. This was a nightmare visit to this beloved museum. Can you say REFUND?????","Written March 10, 2020"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Absolutely magnificent,"I'll never know why people queue for hours to get into the Louvre - well OK, it's most probably to see the Mona Lisa which if they're lucky they might get a glance - when this superb museum is just up the river. A fantastic building holds some superb art with plenty of room to wander around and really appreciate the displays - get the audio tour for a few Euros as it explains so much and be prepared to spend some serious time in there. I've been twice and would go again.",
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Here you find all the impressionists,"If you like the impressionists this is the place for you.

You don‚Äôt need to remove your coat to pass the security check and they will roll their eyes at you and tell you to read instructions better if you try to!

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,The museum I'd go back to immediately if I could,Far smaller than the Louvre but also much more approachable for that reason.

The cafe looked lovely and I wish we could have stopped for a bite.,"Written March 7, 2020"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Truly a world class museum!!!!,Ou est Pompon? Pompon is the artist that created the iconic bear sculpture in this museum and if I'm not mistaken this bear is the museum mascot of sorts. This museum has it all. If you abhor the overly elitist art collection and want to avoid the touristy Mona Lisa fans waiting in line for a selfie at the Louvre you will love this museum. Many iconic works are here. There are sculptures and paintings here. The architecture of the museum inside and out is breathtaking. There are two cafes and three gift shops at least. What I did not like is all the stair climbing yo have to do. You may have to retrace a ton of steps to get to where you want to be a few times too. The cafe at the top is gorgeous. The iconic clock window offers a gorgeous view of Sace Coeur in the distance. There was a pretty long line for a seat in the cafe on the lower level.,
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Beware the school visits,"Went in October last year with husband and teenage sons ...I knew how impressed they would be as I've been before.

The fifth floor is the highlight with all the impressionist masters , apart from the two French school parties who all sat with their teachers right in front of "" Starry night"" and two other Van Gogh's pieces.
This meant that you couldn't get any more than 3/ 4 metres near the paintings....I k ow that's a bit petty ut quite irritating.
Good news is that if your children, under 24, bring their ID they enter free of charge !","Written March 7, 2020"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Great collection of sculptures,"This museum offers one of the biggest collections of sculptures. Once you enter, you simply walk within an avenue of sculptures. Then, on both sides of the building additional collections of paintings from various artists and genres. You can spend at least 2-3 hours.
Note that there is a cloak storage option available, on the left side of the entry. Very useful for storing your winter coats.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Best impressionist museum,"If you are a fan of impressionist art, this is a place you must go. It is over flowing with all sorts of different impressionist artists, along with a nice assortment of statues as well. The building itself used to be a train station and the architecture shows this, and it adds to the character of the whole place. There is also a whole lot to see here and I recommend taking your time as you travel through. My one complaint is that there is an excessive amount of escalators. There was one place where I was trying to get up to the next floor, and there were at least three flights of escalators just to reach the top. Not a huge thing, I just felt an elevator would have done a better job in that situation.","Written March 3, 2020"

With the exception of the Mona Lisa (it's in the Louvre, and it's probably not worth the money) and the roof of the Sistine Chapel (it's in Rome, and it's a roof), chances are the original is here. Monet, Manet, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec... the list of famous painters and sculptors goes on. You can comfortably spend a day wandering around this beautiful gallery without getting bored or your eyes glazing over.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Musee d'Orsay,"The Mus√©e d'Orsay is a museum facing the River Seine and is a former railway station. The museum features French art - paintings, sculptures, furniture, and photography by painters such as Monet, Manet, Renoir Gauguin, and Van Gogh. Thee was a Picasso Exhibition which we wanted to see but the museum was suddenly closed just as we wanted to enter. This was due to a train strike and some demonstration. Must visit and see. Need one day to see it all.",

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Lovely afternoon.,Lovely afternoon exploring this Museum. Really enjoyed the vast works of art and sculpture. The space is magnificent too. Only limitations: only place you can eat and drink is in the cafes. We had to wait a long time to get in as it was busy. There were also very big queues too for the toilets - but I suppose to be expected. The audio tour is highly recommended.,
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Wonderful collection,"Great Monet and Van Gogh collection and wonderful pieces by Camille Pissarro, Bonnard, Manet. Very well laid out and marked- I loved the Louvre, but it was overwhelming whereas I found d‚ÄôOrsay much more relaxed and enjoyable. It could be that we did Louvre in the summer and here in February, so it was far less crowded. We didn‚Äôt get tickets ahead of time, there was no line (we arrived around 11am). In my opinion, it‚Äôs a must when in Paris.",
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Loved this Museum the best!,I think this was my favourite museum. The building is beautiful and its not to large.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Not to be missed for fans of Van Gogh and Impressionist artists,"If you're a fan of Van Gogh and Impressionist artists like Monet, the d'Orsay should definitely be on your list. So many incredible artworks to see including pretty much a whole room for Van Gogh and some pretty amazing sculptures including the original Statue of Liberty and a Rodin work featuring the Thinker. So much to look at and the audio guide really adds to the experience by explaining what artworks mean/their significance.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Must visit,"Well, having studied the Impressionism and Post-Impressionism movements I was really eager to visit this museum and it didn't disappoint. It was such a great pleasure to finally contemplate all paintings that I only knew from books!!
The museum has two small shops and 3 cafes inside to ensure you can spend a long time in there.
Only downside for me was finding rooms and directions was not straight-forward. The layout of the museum kind of makes you to walk back and forth between aisles and rooms so you have to keep an eye on the map to ensure you're not missing anything. Probably doing a bit of planning before the visit might help with this.","Written February 14, 2020"

Some very famous paintings are there and I strongly recommend looking at the most famous. There are also some realism paintures and a few sculptures. It is free for people under 12 and a reduced price for under 26.  It has been created in an old train station. At the top you have a good view.

This is the epicentre of impressionism in Paris. Even though it was free day the crowds weren't as big as you would expect, we only queued for 20 minutes and it was quite a relaxed and civilised affair. Once inside - we made a beeline, to the impressionist gallery to see the likes of Manet, Monet, Renoir, Degas and C√©zanne artworks, just as fabulous as ever.",

Study the plan well and make sure you don't miss any of the galleries. It would be easy to miss exhibits here, go through the gallery on the top floor from the shop end, and make sure you go beyond the cafe to the galleries beyond! We bought a joint advance ticket combined with the Orangerie, and were were glad we went there first as woks there meant we only needed a short visit to see the Monet Water lilies and could move on the the Musee d'Orsay. Orangeries opens at 9 so there is time to go there and get to d'Orsay just after it opens (9.30).","Written February 9, 2020"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,"Two clocks, no waiting!!","Thankfully, Paris did not implode their palatial central railroad station to build a modernist sporting arena (yes, I'm looking at you New York!) but instead have invested the space with the finest of fine art of the past 150 years.
Clearly the life-altering visual orgy focuses on the upper level collection of impressionist, neo & post-impressionist art. Basically, every masterpiece Albert Barnes didn't bring to America (Philly reference here!) hangs here in unequaled density and quality.
If there is a single building in Paris which might inform urban architects as to beauty, context and restoration; this is the one. Sadly, its lessons have fallen on deaf ears.
PRO TIP: There is a >half-hour wait for students to Instagram themselves in front of the iconic giant glass clock-face. But, there are two such faces...the other is in the cafe, excellent service and even a door to the roof-deck, no waiting!","Written February 9, 2020"

Narrow medieval streets with winding alley ways are lit at night by old lamps which expose multi-colored French balconies, windows and beautifully colored red tiled roof buildings with rich histories. Street performers entertain in the evenings as you stroll through the narrow streets. Colorful and artistic personalities seem to gravitate to this part of town. Bars and restaurants are plentiful and diverse offering a wide range of cuisines. Some restaurants can be pricey like Le Boudoir and Di Piu but you can also find less expensive fare.

It gets very hot in the summer but Old town Nice is blessed with many shade trees and the breeze from the sea is welcomed.. Small unique shops that sell local soaps, boutique clothing and perfumes can be found. There are also some more modern shops. Open air markets selling flowers, candies and sea food add much to the overall vibe of this area of Nice. I love gelato and thought the French have a nice version but I prefer Italian gelato.",

It's replete with history and is a delight through which to walk, especially when the tourists are not yet there and when they have left for the day. By day, it's very different than in the evening. During the day, shops are open with displays of product in the pedestrian street areas; at night, when shops are closed, they are barricaded shut and you would never know anything at all was there - no glass shop windows that just go dark after closing time.

France,Old Town,Really more of a summary of what blew me away about Nice...Three Takeaways ( and then some ) ...,"I did plenty of research, boned up on my French, packed for the French Riviera...
Little did I know I'd touch down in a laid back beach town.
I was greeted with fellow travelers in shorts & flip flops.
English was readily spoken especially after I showed my less than stellar accent.
It was much more affordable in almost every way...
So some tips....
Bring water shoes or flip flops for the pebble beaches.
Be ready for amazingly affordable Italian, French and pretty much any other type of food you wish to eat...
(a great 6 euro pizza, a 1 star Michelin rest where we had a Filet with Foie Gras sauce that would have been $30 for the Foie alone in Chicago, but was $30 total therewith tasty vegetables and potatoes )
There were 188 Michelin restaurants in Nice a town of barely over 300k people...amazing!
You can eat Lunch at the 3 star Louis the 15th in Monaco than many 1 star Prix Fixe meals here in the states, and you get the added bonus of overlooking the Monte Carlo casino and the blue. blue Mediterranean.
Ride from Nice to Monaco for 1.5 euros ( taxi or uber think 50 to 100 euros ) a steal the view alone is priceless.
Be nice and the language barrier will become virtually non-existent.
Be ready to walk bring the comfiest of shoes and comfy stylish clothing.
It's hard to get lost here... it's compact and the water lends a nice (no pun intended) landmark.
Do visit all the tourist spots.. they're frequented for a reason !
Most of all don't rush, take your time to enjoy the perfect weather, warm wonderful people, and the Light... like no other I've experienced.... again there is a reason so many famous painters flocked to the south of France !
Public transit is great, and reliable.
Rent an Electric scooter if you need to cover more ground but still want the experience of not being in a bus.
Taxi's were the one spendy thing we found there... the streets force then to take the long way round.
Tram from the airport to the promenade and close enough to oldtown.
(2 euros a cab ride could be 30-50 euros )
I'd go back in a heartbeat, and I'd take even more time to smell the flowers...
Lastly the train station while being very efficient was not the easiest for non french speakers and was CROWDED... research your ride... I found out almost too late that the train to Avignon ( highly recommended for an over night trip ) was really the train to Paris even though my ticket made no mention of it.
So to recap,
Little to no language barrier
Cheaper than I thought
More laid back then I could have imagined.
Oh and no customs to pass though upon arrival ( we transferred in Portugal ) so off the plane straight to the tram and 1.5 blocks to our hotel after a 15 min ride )
For budget travelers we used Orbitz to book hit it over Labor day weekend here, and for a more than decent hotel with great staff 1 block off the promenade mid way down ( 1 block from the world famous Negresco hotel ) was under $1k per person for 10 days air, hotel taxes included.
WHAT's not to LOVE !
J'aime Nice !
Oh I have to mention Old Town since it's under this section...
Loved it... had amazing food again for not crazy money, found great small shops, and again warm wonderful people ( and the Gelato .... pretty amazing too !)",

Be prepared to eat dinner late, and to take your time savoring eery minute (as the French do). We rented a lovely air b-n-b apartment right on the Cours Salaya, a block from the beach, and in the heart of the market, and felt like locals after just a few days. We are an older gay male couple, and we encountered no problems with the local French people in this area (maybe a few comments from one or two tourists from non-gay friendly countries, but nothing as aggravating as the homophobic people we encountered in Ventimiglia, Italy, which was just horrible). We will return to Nice again soon. Make sure to master taking the tram, and the train that runs along the coast - so easy and convenient to all the towns on the Riviera!","Written November 5, 2019"

The influence of Belle √âpoque architecture is ubiquitous in Nice .When these magnificent properties were first built, the majority were painted cream and white so they would have stood proud in the sunshine ‚Äì self-important, akin to giant wedding cakes. But now, one hundred or so years on, most of them have mellowed pleasingly and they create a certain ambiance of grandeur tinged with nostalgia.",

France,Old Town,Most popular areas of the city,"Nice Old Town is one of the most popular areas of the city. There is a lively atmosphere in this area both day and night and really nothing to see here. You can choose to wander around the Old Town area with no neat plan, enjoy the look of the old buildings and stop at some of the shops on the way, or you can follow a pre-planned itinerary to see some of Nice's most prominent sights. If you are interested, you can also join a guided tour of the area of Nice Old Town and Castle Hill.

In the past, Nice's old town was detached from the new city, as the Paillon River crossed between the two sections. In 2013, the two parts of the city joined together through the Promenade du Paillon Promenade, a charming promenade adorned with trees, plants, ponds and beautiful fountains. This is your entry point to the ancient city of Nice. From there, proceed to rue St Fran√ßois de Paule, which is packed with specialty shops. After a short time you will see on your right the Nice Opera House. It is an impressive Italian-style building built in 1881. Continue straight until you reach a street called Cours Saleya. It is the busiest street in Old Nice. In the morning, the street is filled with stalls and becomes an open flower market, which also offers some fruits and vegetables. When you reach the end of the street, we recommend that you turn right, return to the shoreline and continue east until you turn left onto the 300 steps leading up to Castle Hill. There is also the option of getting on the elevator if you prefer. The hill rises to 92 meters above sea level, making it in the years past a particularly strategic military spot, overlooking Nice Bay. The hilltop castle was used between the 11th and 18th centuries, but was destroyed in 1706. Today, all that remains on the hilltop are the remains of the ruined castle and, of course, spectacular views of the surrounding area.","Written October 17, 2019"

What we loved was that it did not feel overcrowded with tourists either in the old town or along the beach (rocks not sand). In contrast to the narrow streets of old town, the streets lining the beach are broad and open and lined with great looking hotels. We had plenty of time to shop, poke around, and visit the beach but no time for eating on this part of the tour.

There's a special room for tapers there as well; it's about the size of a big closet and you leave your lit candle at small window and the man inside then places it, (I had the image that he was there atoning for some sins; it was in the 30's (C) outside, so in there it must have been a sauna.)",

The 60 bus runs every 15 minutes or so, needs no tickets and stops at Notre Dame at the same hilltop stop as Petit-Train. The 60 bus runs from virtually the same Old Port stop (near Metro Vieux Port stop) where both Petit-Train and ColorBus also stop.
And if you take the #60 bus down from Notre Dame, it passes by (and also stops at) old port and goes right to the MUCEM museum - very handy!

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,A must visit,"Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde is a beautiful building standing tall at the highest peak of the old city. It was built in a couple of different styles, one of which is the lovely Neo-Byzantine style. The history of the church goes back to around the 12th or 13th centuries. It started off as a small church and because of its high location became a sort of symbol, particularly for sailors, who ended up making offerings of thanks after surviving shipwrecks. This also explains the presence of small boat offerings which hang around the interior of the church. The present building is actually a kind of extension of the original smaller church, and was built in the second half of the 19th century. The interior of the church is absolutely stunning and the exterior is also beautiful. The views from the top of the hill where the church is located are really wonderful and panoramic. You can see practically the whole city down below. We walked up the hill and this took us quite a while, but it was pleasant. many people, however, prefer to either drive or catch the bus or tourist ""train"" to the top.",

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Regent Cruise Marseille Shore Excursion guide Day 2. Part 4,"The Basilique Notre Dame dela Garde started in 1214 when a priest of Marseilles whose first name was Pierre erected a small sanctuary dedicated to the Virgin Mary upon the rocky triangle forming the top of a 161 metre-high hill facing the town of Marseille, which was very small at the time.

In the 16th century the chapel is embodied within a fortress. Francis 1st came to Provence and decided to build two fortresses in Marseilles: one on the island of If ( the famous Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôIf) and the other on top of the Garde Hill where the chapel. This was the time when Charles 5th, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, was intending to take possession of the south of France in order to reunite the two parts of his Empire (Central Europe and Spain). For 4 centuries, the fortress served as a military sanctuary and as a chapel.

In 1853, the construction of the Basilica was started to replace the small chapel. For four days in June 1931, a host of 49 bishops and 300,000 people came to join the celebrations for the crowning of the statue of Notre-Dame de la Garde. In 1934, the church was officially demilitarized by the President. However, the Nazis came in WWII and occupied the fortress.

Today, tourists can enjoy looking at the beautiful mosaics inside the church. The views of the city are breathtaking. The golden statue at the very top looking out the sea is a majestic sight to behold.",

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Exceptional Cathedral in Marseille France,"You can literally see this Cathedral from anywhere near Marseille. It is built on the highest spot in Marseille. It involves a lot of steps to even get to it. You walk up 148 steps and you get to elevators which take you up 6 more flights to the entrance. It is very ornate and beautiful both inside and out. Also being that high up gives you fabulous views of the city if Marseille. You can see the harbor, the Castle d‚Äôif, the other islands and far out to sea. You can‚Äôt go to Marseille and not take the time to see this beautiful church.",
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Worth a visit,"This is a great place to have a panoramic view of Marseille, including the soccer stadium. Take bus 60 from the Mucem, which is a lot easier than walking up the hill. Great architecture. Huge display of fishing and other vessels in recognition of a safe return by mariners. Very beautiful interior with a great altar. Walk around and admire the view of Marseille. This is still an active church and attendance goes up every time the Marseille soccer team plays a game and fans pray for a win. Bus drops you off at the top (other stops at the stairs and the elevator). Nice, clean and modern bathroom facilities ... and free. Not to be missed.","Written September 25, 2019"

We took the tourist train to the top and then walked down to the port.",
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,"Beautiful maritime theme church, overrun with tourists","Cathedrals are designed to inspire and this succeeds. The grand size, amount of gold leaf, and placement on the highest point overlooking Marseilles are each breathtaking. Ship models hanging in the church, and the ship mosaic behind the alter are all testaments to the maritime history of the town. Unfortunately, the hordes of picture and selfie taking tourists (including us) make it seem more like an amusement center and less like a holy place. Many memorials in and outside the church to those who gave their lives in WWII retaking the church and hill without using any heavy weapons so as to spare the church.",

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,A Marseille must-do for any visitor,"Unbeatable views from the highest point in the city. The inside of the church is fascinating and beautiful. This should be on any Marseille tourist's must-do list.

You can walk up the hill if you're looking for a hot, sweaty workout! I'd suggest a taxi or bus for most people. (Or car, but you might want to leave the driving in central Marseille to someone else!) Also, be aware of the opening hours, as you get booted out fairly early in the evening.","Written September 15, 2019"
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Worth seeing,"Free entry to main chapel and free decent toilets. Admission payable for some areas. Great views. Easily reached by the 'Little Train' 8 Euros from town centre, however due to the steepness of the hillside the Little Train is unreliable if there is rainfall. You may have to catch a local bus to return that also stops at the Basilique on a regular basis. Best to get there as early as possible as queues for train get long, Basilique gets busy and it could get very hot if walking.","Written September 14, 2019"

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Sailor's Basilica,"We took a bus up and then climbed the final 75 or so stairs. The view of the city and the sea are dramatic from the top of the hill. Inside is a truly beautiful cathedral, but what sets it apart from most is that this is a mariner's cathedral. I think mariner's churches are really cool because they have lots of model ships hanging from the ceiling, either to ask for God's protection or to give thanks for safe sailings. Aside from all kinds of ships hanging, there were also planes, and submarines and even a space shuttle. The kitschy-ness of the models seems incongruous with the grandeur and solemnity of the architecture and design, but that's why I like it. Continuing with the sailor's theme, there's lots of old ship paintings on the walls. And as a bonus, for those not into the mariners, there is a really, really giant gold statue on the top of the bell tower.","Written September 12, 2019"
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Worth it for amazing views,"The basilica seems smaller inside than the imposing exterior would suggest when you see it from a distance. If you are looking for some exercise, walk up via Mont√©e de l‚ÄôOratoire or Mont√©e de la Bonne Mere. You will be rewarded with some amazing views over the city and the Mediterranean. Otherwise, there is a public bus service which will take you there from town (bus #60 from the Vieux Port).

The interior of the basilica does have some stunning gold leaf decoration that was unexpected and very ornate. There are also models of ships and other nautical items suspended from the ceiling. There is nothing really to see in the crypt - just a simple chapel where you can go to pray.

By the way, there are very clean toilets, free of charge on level 2!","Written September 12, 2019"

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,"Imposing, thought provoking and beautiful","We walked up through the interesting streets of Marseille's Vieux Port area on a lovely summers day, hot and sunny but with a nice breeze. The final push up to Notre Dame de la Garde was steep, stepped and exposed to the sun but full of stunning views of Marseille and the surrounding hills... worth the effort (there is a little tourist train/bus that can be ridden up if you don't want the walk).
The basilica was very busy (11:30am) when we arrived but despite that there was space and time to enjoy the building at length as well as take in the STUNNING panoramic views. The architecture, decoration and general feel of the whole visit, even for non-religious visitors like ourselves, was humbling, thought provoking and well worth the effort.
There is a curious restaurant on site... in the UK some people might refer to it as a blue-rinse special. The 'older' French locals had totally booked the entire restaurant... a good deal to be had it would seem.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Grand Basilica at Marseille's Highest Point,"Notre-Dame de la Garde can translate to Our Lady of the Guard. It is a Catholic church and Marseille's best-known symbol. The basilica is constructed on a tall (~180 foot) limestone hill, known as ""La Garde,"" overlooking the Old Port. Long before the basilica, dating to 1214, an original chapel to the Virgin Mary was built on this site. Subsequently, the site was used for city fortifications, including a fort built in the early 1500's. The basilica's construction, began in 1852, utilized the foundation of the ancient 16th century fort. Some remains of the fort can still be seen on the West side of the basilica. Construction lasted twenty one years under the direction of architect Henri-Jacques Esp√©randieu. This grand church is composed of a lower Romanesque style building or crypt, carved from the limestone, and an upper Neo-Byzantine style building. The upper building includes a square 135 foot bell tower topped by a 41 foot belfry. The bell within weighs over 18,000 pounds. The belfry is covered by a square terrace, which is enclosed by a stone balustrade - an angel with a trumpet stands at each corner. The belfry is the base of a huge 37 foot statue of the Virgin Mary and Child. The statue was built in four sections and is made of copper gilded with gold leaf. The lower building or crypt is dark and somber. The entrance features marble statues of Bishop Eug√®ne de Mazenod and Pope Pius IX. The side altars are devoted to saints Philomena, Andrew, Rose, Henry, Louis and Benedict Labre. The main altar is of Golfolina stone with columns of Spanish marble. Behind the altar is a statue of the Madonna holding child and a flower bouquet. The upper buildings nave is ~105 feet by 46 feet. The side chapels are ~12 feet by 18 feet. The interior is wonderfully decorated with 13,000 square feet of mosaics, as well as alternating red and white marble columns and pilasters. The mosaics and artwork within the semi-circular apse area containing the altar are also beautiful. Behind the altar, a red marble column topped by a gilded capital supports a statue of Mary, made of hammered silver. The courtyard surrounding the basilica also needs to be toured. It contains several statues including Passion of Christ. Further, the hilltop provides tremendous panoramic views of Marseille and the Mediterranean. When in Marseille this site is not to be missed!!",

As other reviewers have said the view is beyond spectacular... you get 360¬∞ views of the Mediterranean Sea,the city of Marseille and surrounding hills and mountains in the distance. For that alone it would be worth a visit but the Basilica itself is also a stunning work of architecture that's worth visiting. It's style is Byzantine and the interior has many mosaics that reflect that style. This particular incarnation of the Virgin Mary is seen as the protector of sailors and all who go out to sea,and since we were on a cruise and are in fact Catholic we took the opportunity to say a little prayer for a safe voyage. Visitors will notice model ships of all types hanging from the ceiling as well as plaques along the walls from those faithful whose prayers to the Virgin Mary were answered. When it was time to go we descended on foot all the way to the Vieux Port,the walk was a lot easier than we thought it would be but of course downhill is always easier!",
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Worth the effort,This little church is well worth the uphill trek. It has the most wonderful view of Marseille and surrounds and the inside is stunning. I‚Äôm very pleased I went. There is a public bus which takes you almost to the top or you can walk from the old port up the hill to get there. Definitely put this on your ‚Äòto do‚Äô list.,
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Fantastic views and great exercise climbing,"Walking from base to the top is a strenuous task, especially in the midday summer heat. Recommend early morning. Two different routes, the back side is a longer- flatter climb.

The Basilique is really worth seeing.",
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,What spectacular views from the top,"We took the tourist train to the top.
It was fantastic getting to see the local streets as we went up and local restaurants as well as the fabulous harbour and sea views.
You go up very step hills so you get fantastic views.
There are 3 viewpoints at the top of the Notre Dame de la Garde and you get a 360 degree view of the city.
The Notre Dame cathedral inside is fabulous you get a real sense of religion definitely worth taking a few photos.

Definitely a site worth visiting whilst you are on your travels.",
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Another Mary church,"The building is beautiful. It is a long walk up the many stairs. Unique interior, with ship models given by appreciative sailors. But I thought Christianity was about Jesus more than Mary, her role obscures that of the savior.","Written July 29, 2019"
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,RichardWalton Stourport,"It‚Äôs worth the visit. Beware if you walk up the steep hill it‚Äôs very hard work. My smartphone said I had climbed 27 floors. Some people may find it too hard. The colorbus, small white train and taxis can take you there if you need. When you get to the church you can go to the top 6th floor in the lift. It‚Äôs free to enter and the view is 360‚Äô and takes in Marseille and the port. The church itself is beautiful and worth savouring the architecture and atmosphere. The cafe is pretty basic but it‚Äôs much appreciated for a sit down and cold drink. There are signs warning of pickpockets but it feels very safe there.",
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Lovely viewpoint to see the city of Marseilles,"Take Le Petit Train tour 1 from the quayside in the old harbour. 8 euros 12 and over. 4 euros 3-11. Well worth the cost. You are given a 2-part ticket so you can get off at the Basillica for as long as you need before riding the regular road train back down.

We took the free unadvertised option to get from MSC Belissima at the cruise port into town. Get off your cruise ship. Ignore the tickets delivered to your cabin that would have cost us 52 euros and walk following the Green pedestrian footway until you teach the Port Authority free bus approx 10 mins. Take the bus to the end of the line and you are dropped off next to Place de Joilette. 5 min walk from there to harbour and Le Petit Train.","Written July 27, 2019"
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Great view,"We took a tourist long bus up to the hills,- the view is magnificent and the Notre Dame is magnificent itself. We enjoyed the tour although a bit crowded.",
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Think about it first ... read this,"Looking up at the magnificent cathedral de notre dame from the waterfront it stands proud and looks great by day it by night. So you want to visit but how do you get there?

We walked - wow not sure I‚Äôd do that again - it‚Äôs a long steep walk and the last part is brutal.

My suggestion is to get the bus-train. You get on by the waterfront and it drops you off ‚Äúalmost‚Äù at the top but there are still steps once you get there to climb.

The Crypt is full of candles and quietly respectfully somber - the basilica at the top is truly magnificent and the artisans work on the ceilings is amazing. It‚Äôs free to enter - just be ready for a hike!",
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Excellent,"Enjoyed our visit to the church.The views all around the city were excellent from this magnificent church.The inside of the church was stunning.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Spectacular Views of Marseille,"I don't usually visit churches but I had heard that the views were great from Notre Dame de la Garde, which isn't surprising given that you can see the church from most locations in Marseille.

I took the 8 Euro ""tourist train"", aka the Petite Train de Marseille, (Route 1). There is also a cheaper No 60 city bus that goes to the church, but as someone who has never taken a tour bus or anything similar, I still highy recommend this ""tourist train"" because, unlike the bus, the seating is outdoors, close to the ground, and the route is along the beautiful corniche, where you see beaches, etc. Really worth the extra money. You can catch this ""train"" at the Old Port on the Quai du Port.

The views of Marseille, the port, etc from the church are spectacular. Pictures can be taken from several outdoor locations. The church is also lovely and very spiritual. Small models of boats hang from the rafters, which is consistent with this port city. Really worth the trip. You probably need about 2 hours for the entire trip (back and forth from Old Port and on-site).","Written July 20, 2019"
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Free Entrance & Great Views,This is open daily and overlooks the Vieux Port. it was built in the 19th Century in the Romanesque-Byzantine style and is crowned with a statue of the Virgin Mary.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Amen to that!,"Very large and very beautiful structure located at a hilltop summit. Epic example of architecture in the city and most visited place, rightly so.
The view from the top is as breath taking as the intricate masonry work inside.
A little souvenir shop located on top is a nice touch.
To reach here you can take bus. No.60 from vieux port and this service is FREE of cost. Also there is a 4euro trip that can be done from the museum side of vieux port to the top in a open air toy train which too is a good fun ride for any kids.
CANNOT MISS THIS PLACE!",
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Worth a visit,I visited having caught the no.60 bus down by the hotel de Ville near the marina. The views are amazing and the church impressive. You can also take the small tourist train at ‚Ç¨8 per adult although the bus was ‚Ç¨1.70 or free using the metro pass.,
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Best of Marseille,"If you have time for only one thing in Marseille, go here. We walked from Vieux Port to the Basilique. Not for the faint of heart (a huge staircase awaits when you get up the hill) but it was fun to meander through Marseille neighborhoods. You can also take a trolley from Vieux Port. The views from the grounds are stunning. All of Marseille, the water and the Calenques in the distance. The church itself is very beautiful - ornate and solemn with a maritime theme on the side. There are model boats suspended from the ceiling and paintings of ships and sea line the walls on the right, facing the altar. After our visit we hiked down to the beach and enjoyed the refreshing waters of the Mediterranean. Lovely day!","Written July 16, 2019"

Inside is beautiful. We had lunch there, but never again - We walk down from church on foot to the Chalet du Pharo stopping half way by accident at a really nice restaurant Sepia in a small park where we had lovely desserts and coffee. We will go there again on next visit to Marselle for a full lunch. Then we carried on on foot to Chalet du Pharo .

At one of the highest points of Marseille, there are three excellent vantage points from which to take panoramic photos of the entire city, bay and small islands nearby.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Bliss Tour de France 2019,"Baking hot day in June heatwave of 2019 - extinction rebellion might be on to something - took the 60 bus from stop at the mucem end of the port, ensuring a seat. The bus was cool and took in some great views on way up to basilica. We passed some exhausted looking cyclists on the way up. As much as I love my cycling, I couldn't think of a worse thing to do today. There was a nice breeze at the top and some fantastic panoramic views. Felt very lazy getting the lift up to the basilica but nobody seemed to know about it and we shared the lift with one other couple. If there had been a wheelchair or pram needing lift I would naturally step aside, honest. It's just inside the museum entrance if you go on an equally hot day and you too are trying to stay cool ( not really cool, more like less boiling ) then take a look. I suspect the queues are never that long. Beautiful Byzantine interior with nautical flavour to many artefacts. The opposite of Dr Who's tardis as feels quite cosy and intimate for a large cathedral. Couldn't help wondering how it got built. Would have been murder lugging all those stones to top of that hill, especially in this heat. Well I suppose that's what trips to places like this are for, to make you stop and think.","Written June 27, 2019"

I did the Color Bus because it will drop you close, so that the climb is significantly reduced. You can also set your watch for catching the bus on its return to complete the tour. Color Bus is good for two days and will allow you to see other sights in the same manner. Basilique Notre Dame's main attraction is its proximity and lofty status above the city. You can see for miles. It was beautiful in May with good weather. Try to pick days that are not too cold or too hot.

There is a small train that makes the trip, but we noticed that people waited a LONG time for the ride down the mountain.

France,Vieux Lyon,Thought to be unlivable in the 19th century,"Lyon old town, known as Vieux Lyon, is situated across the Saone River from the Presqu'ile district in the heart of beautiful Lyon. The 16th century was a time of thriving business since Lyon was a crossroads of trade between Italy, Spain, and France. Four and five-story houses were built with interior courtyards, staircases, and galleries as the area grew to accommodate the thriving business population. Many of those homes show the influence of the Italians who were key trading partners at the time. Vieux Lyon is one of the largest Renaissance neighborhoods in Europe and offers over 2,000 years of history including Romain ruins. Surprisingly, during the 19th century, the old town was thought to be ""unlivable"" and a plan was proposed to build a major road through the middle of it. Fortunately, this plan was dropped and major restorations and renovations were started in the area.","Written June 29, 2020"

I have a walkthrough Lyon with my family, including several teens, in December 2019 last year. The Christmas holidays brought us from Macau to Lyon, and the visit is much enjoyable. There are still some roman vestiges of Lugdunum, some medieval architecture as in the old St. Jonh the Baptist cathedral, and the historic center evolves along the calm Rh√¥ne, still a majestic river. Most of Lyon's historical center is a mosaic of late 19th century, early 20th century buildings, a lot of them transformed into commercial areas. Thus, a visit to old Lyon must include some shopping and lunch or dinner in one of the countless restaurants available. I have also visit antique bookshops and found some precious books.

France,Vieux Lyon,Love Vieux Lyon,"Our Lyon City Greeter, Jean Claude, once again brought us here and it was only a 10 to 15 minute walk from Place Bellecour. Vieux Lyon is not only charming but there are so so many shops, restaurants, and Traboules (hidden passages) Our Greeter brought us inside these traboules which we would not have been able to find ourselves.
Glacier Terre Adelice, ice cream, was the best as our greeter told us about. 2 balls for 5 euros and they have over 50 flavors. We tried the chevre and the bergamot and both were outstanding.

The energy and the vibe in Vieux Lyon are wonderful and there is even a little flea market infront of the little church square on the weekends until about 7pm.

We stayed in an apartment beside Rue Maronniers which is in the center of the new Lyon for shopping and lots of dining but Vieux Lyon is like walking back in time in Lyon 100 years. We loved Vieux Lyon's charm!","Written September 22, 2019"

France,Vieux Lyon,"Lovely old town, complete with hidden passage ways","We had a lovely walk around Lyon Old Town (also known as ‚ÄúVieux-Lyon‚Äù). The old town is one of the largest old towns in France and well known for its secret passageways (Traboules). The old town has managed to remain almost unchanged for centuries.

Lyon Old Town is divided into three districts, all referring to Christian saints: St Paul, St John and St George. Within the old town there are masses of restaurants (most with outdoor seating), but the most fun part is looking for the seals that mark the entrances to the Traboule, then finding out what secret world lies behind the door.",

France,Vieux Lyon,Great exploration through secret passages and along car free streets.,It is a wonderful journey down cobblestone roads which are pedestrian only for the most part. Then there are the secret passages that join streets together which were built by the old silk traders.

When you are finished exploring you can take the funicular or stairs if you feel sporty up to the top of the mountain where there is the cathedral and the ancient ruins of an amphitheater.

The cathedral is very nice too. And try the numerous restaurants, typical in the city called les Bouchons.

France,Vieux Lyon,A 'must visit' if ever in Lyon.,"Packed with alleys and restuarants, cafes and bars but also quite 'touristy'. Not far from the river Saone I think which you need to cross by foot which also affords a great view of the Fourvier basilica. We preferred though to relax on the centre (centre ville) side of the river as was a little cheaper and more 'local' near our hotel and the place Celestine (the theatre).

France,Vieux Lyon,Quaint and Lovely Old town with traboules!,"The two pararelled pedestrian streets rue St Jean and rue du boeuf are the main drag with shops, restos, cafes, patisseries, and traboules (narrow silk worker paths tunneling pass homes and buildings). Great fun to stroll and visit any shops. I could spend an entire day in this area but we took a free city tour and time was limited. Start the walk fr the cathedral and cross the bridge to Croix Rousse. The traboules are fun to explore but can be easily missed. They are marked with shield-shaped bronze plaques, while in the Croix-Rousse, it's a lion‚Äôs head on a blue background. From south to north, on rue st. Jean, Look for #54, 42, 28, 27, 24, 18. On rue du boeuf, 31, 27, etc. Note that some of these doors were locked. Good places to check out are: Boulangerie du Palais, Terre Adelice (fame ice cream), Maison Brochier Soieries (old silk shop), La Tour Rose (in traboule‚Äîa pink building owned by a rich dude during the silk booming era). We stopped in front of the oldest building in the city but I can't remember its location. In the same square is another traboule (at a corner).","Written July 17, 2019"
France,Vieux Lyon,I Miss Vieux Lyon,"We walked into old town, Vieux Lyon, and up to the Basilique de Notre
Dame de Fourviere, which is at the highest point in the city. We walked up 250 steps and 10 steep switchback paths that were the equivalent of 20 stories high. At the top, there were beautiful views of the city including the two rivers that pass through it. The cathedral itself was massive. Then we walked down past the Roman ruins that have been here since the city was founded. Since we were already worn out by the earlier climb up the hill, we declined to climb up the ruins. Julius Caesar made this city the headquarters of his Gallic campaigns. Finally, we reached the bottom, had lunch, and toured the Church of St. Jean, where Pope John XXII was consecrated centuries ago, and Marie d‚ÄôMedici married King Henri IV in 1600. Inside the church was a massive clock built in the 1300s. Some event was going on so there were about 12 French soldiers with machine guns on guard. That made us a bit edgy. In spite of that, we found a geo-cache around the corner from the church. Walking through old town was an interesting experience that was only slightly diminished by the 99-degree temperatures. On the way back, we looked for and found a couple of ‚Äútraboules‚Äù, which are hidden passageways that pass between buildings, may include courtyards and staircases and allow the owner‚Äôs access to the buildings. We found a geo-cache hidden near the historical plaque.","Written July 17, 2019"

France,Vieux Lyon,Transported to 15th century (or earlier),"We did not take one of the walking tours on offer so probably missed out on actual details and facts of the neighborhood but just walking the cobble-stoned streets was truly amazing even if at times a couple of my travel companions said it ""feels like Disney World or Epcot."" But this is the REAL thing. It is perhaps a bit touristy with the requisite gift shops and restaurants attempting to attract them, there are nonetheless a few genuine bouchons to choose from as well those which call themselves that.

France,Vieux Lyon,Teeming with history and very picturesque,"I loved Vieux Lyon, both wandering on my own and latterly with a tour guide. It is pretty small but is steeped in much history going right back to Roman times, then Medieval and Renaissance and now modern times. The streets are narrow and it can get very busy and now there are mostly cafes and bars there but if you scratch the surface there‚Äôs heaps of history.

Most of the area is paved and uneven but flat. The traboules (secret passages) are very intriguing and they are worth a bit of time to poke your nose in. You can get a map from the Visitor Centre, take a tour or just wander on your own.

The raise of the wall of prayer also starts here, down at the river side, you can walk the curved route on the way to the top, where you will find Lyons, Notre Dame, Cathedral, what an amazing building with a history worth studying. And if thats not enough, the view platform behind the Cathedral, just explores more or less the entire city of Lyon, the two rivers running parallel around Bellecour.

France,Vieux Lyon,"Vieux Lyon, so much to discover","Vieux Lyon is a UNESCO world heritage site, and well worth a visit. I have been many many times, as I live just outside the city, and I never get bored of wandering round this charming area. A medieval centre filled with hidden secret passageways (Traboules) to discover, cobbled streets, an imposing gothic cathedral overlooked by the Fourvi√®re Basilica perched above upon the Fourvi√®re Hill, this place is steeped in history. Many shops specialising in silk give a nod to Lyon's economic past as the European hub of silk production and weaving. Vieux Lyon is filled with restaurants, ranging from classic local cuisine in the many ""Bouchons"", to the Michelin starred establishments (rue du b≈ìuf has a few of these), to street food available to passers by. There are also many museums, interesting shops and statues to visit or see. The atmosphere in Vieux Lyon is so relaxed and joyful, like a little village. Unlike other historic centres, people do indeed live there.
Vieux Lyon has so much to offer, and is a great place to start of you want a taste of what this city has to offer.
Worth particular attention:
- Finding the traboules (most are unlocked between 9am and 12pm)
- The St Jean Cathedral, it's stone carvings on the exterior, astronomical clock inside, and mix of modern and original medieval stained glass windows
- The museum of Miniatures and Cinema (first room is free to visit, and worth a look!)
- Take the funicular train from Vieux Lyon m√©tro station up to the top of Fourvi√®re Hill to get a view of the whole city from next to the basilica, and also walk around the Roman ruins of the amphitheatre and odeon

Local food to try :
- Quenelles
- A meal in a Bouchon restaurant
- a tarte au praline rose

France,Vieux Lyon,Beautiful Old Town,"We did a walking tour of Vieux Lyon, one of the largest old towns in France, with our river cruise. Started at the Palais de Justice (1835), and on through the narrow, winding streets. We were able to go through several traboules - the city's hidden passageways. They join 2 streets as a shortcut, often running through several buildings. Originally to allow silk makers to transport their goods unmarred, used later by the French resistance to dodge the Nazis. Several of these are open to the public, but many are private and locked, only for the building residents' use. Lots of interesting Renaissance architecture - shops and cafes. We stopped at a bakery for a sample of delicious praline pastry. Many of the houses were built 4 and 5 storeys high, with interior courtyards and lovely ironwork. French Gothic style, with an Italian influence, apparently from the Italian silk makers brought in to teach the the locals residents about silk making. it can be a bit risky just walking along these narrow, twisty streets, as cars and trucks just push their way through. So many intersting looking shops and restaurants, I wish we had more time here!","Written May 18, 2019"

France,Vieux Lyon,Preserved by the efforts of Andr√© Malraux.,"Old Lyon was preserved by the efforts of Andr√© Malraux, the hero of the Resistance, the famous associate of General de Gaulle, the Minister of culture of France. The quarter became the first protected urban area in France. Half-abandoned houses were forbidden to demolish, only to restore. 500 buildings of the district became a World heritage site in 2011. Old Lyon consists of three districts that used to be separate villages. The Northern quarter of Saint-Paul, where large bourgeoisie lived , Saint-Jean, the quarter of clergy and nobility and Saint-Georges for artisans and traders. It is clear that the first two have richer buildings and tourists are interested in them first. The main feature of old Lyon is the traboule, pedestrian passage through the block, allowing you to navigate from one street to another. Part of traboulay is public, others are closed by combination locks. The most famous traboule in the quarter is a Long trabol. You`ii find the entrance at Rue Saint-Jean 54, the output on the parallel Rue du Boeuf, 27. You`ll open the next one immediately. On the Rue du Boeuf is possible to ""dive"" into another traboule on the same street in the house 16. This is the Pink tower's vestibule. And, of course, it is necessary to visit the Cathedral of Saint-Jean. The Cathedral dedicated to John the Baptist is very important for French history. Here Henry IV married Maria de Medici and Richelieu became a cardinal . Wow-effect is impossible: the Cathedral was battered Huguenots in the sixteenth century, and the sans-culottes in the XVIII century.",

We stopped in a small convent on the way down the hill which housed a small museum and story about Christian martyrs during Lugdunam's Roman period. The curator was charming despite our poor French and we enjoyed the museum. By the way, you can also see the Roman amphitheater up near the top of the hill without paying to go into the Gallo-Roman museum. We've seen our share of Roman ruins in Italy so we enjoyed the view without needing to get up close.","Written October 3, 2018"
France,Vieux Lyon,Breathe in the history,"Obviously quite a tourist draw with every temptation imaginable in the vast array of little shops, hidden side alleys leading to secret buildings behind the commercial fascias. Visiting on a Sunday afternoon, the cobbled streets were packed, street artists performed, brass bands played, street food consumed, the bubble makers in one of the squares had parents laughing and children squealing with delight at the shapes they were making. Great atmosphere, take your time to let it all sink in.","Written October 3, 2018"

There are lots of little shops and tons of restaurants as well as hidden doors which have been used to sneak off the main path (as people needed to do when the Germans were chasing them in WWII), but were originally meant to allow fewer streets in the area and thus more buildings.","Written October 1, 2018"

France,Vieux Lyon,"Too Big, Too Noisy and Too Warm.","A group of us decided to visit this bistro for dinner. This is a vast space accommodating many diners.

France,Vieux Lyon,The heart of Lyon,"The most traveled to location in France, perhaps even in Europe, is Paris. And there is certainly a lot to see and experience there. But to really experience France you need to see a lot more than that one city which, in the end, only represents a narrow slice of French culture. A well traveled friend of mine, on hearing of my love for Paris, extolled the virtues of Lyon as the ultimate food destination in France. I took to reading about Lyon and discovered it's rich history as well as it's alternate take on French city life. Lyon is smaller and consequently packs it's history and culinary delights into a smaller footprint. And with it's easy to navigate public transportation you can get to everything more easily than in Paris.

The buildings and cobblestone streets of Vieux Lyon (Old Lyon) date back to the 15th century and you can feel it's history walking those ancient streets. Depending on the time of year, you may be sharing those streets with a lot of other tourists, but we found that manageable and it doesn't take away from the charm of the area. There are numerous restaurants and ""Bouchons"" (family style restaurants specializing in hearty working man's food.) There are several large, significant churches / cathedrals and the Basilica on the hill above. There are also roman ruins on the hill that are worth a visit. And after a day of sightseeing, Vieux Lyon is a wonderful area to take in at night with it's bars and restaurants serving outside tables (in warm weather), Crepe and Gelato stands, and public squares. The walk along the river in the moonlight is especially memorable.

We had to get Rome, London, Madrid, and multiple trips to Paris out of the way before we added Lyon to the list. We combined that trip with Provence, Marseilles and Nice, all of which was wonderful. So when you are ready for that ""deeper dive"" into Europe I would certainly recommend Lyon and when in Lyon, Vieux Lyon is not to be missed.",
France,Vieux Lyon,Secret Passageways in Old Lyon!,Historic Old Lyon is especially fascinating because of its ‚Äútraboules‚Äù which are passageways leading from streets through courtyards in buildings where people reside. They were used as early as the 4th century to allow more direct access to the water than the winding streets would allow. A very few are still open to the public and are so interesting to see. Charming restaurants and shops abound in this area. Don‚Äôt miss!,

Arguably it's biggest draw is the water mirror located across the road from it. This large, shallow pool has 3 settings, a vapour spray, waves and a perfectly still pool which offers a perfect reflection of the palace. These alternate at a rate I didn't quite work out, but fairly regularly.

The mirrored pool also acts almost as a focal point for citizens as throughout the day and night they meet and sit there, which creates a nice atmosphere. On a hot day you'll find kids and tourists ditch their shoes for a stroll through the pool, and occasionally teenagers will cycle through it, presumably just for attention from the passing crowd as I can't really work out any benefit.

Something of a must see if visiting Bordeaux, I've got to recommend at least taking a stroll past, truth be told it's something easily done unintentionally and a pleasant surprise!",

France,Place de la Bourse,Perfect on a hot day,"This is a kind of huge flat paved area which fills to about an inch depth of water and then little emits streams of mist to about 4 feet high. This happens roughly every half hour or so. The mist is ice cold and very refreshing and lasts about ten minutes. People are allowed to walk through it and the kids love it. Afterwards, all the water drains down through the cracks and it almost dries up before happening again about thirty minutes later. As it is next to the river it gives a kind of magical and eerie atmosphere and makes for good photographs. When it fills up and before the mist starts, providing the wind isn't too strong, the water creates a kind of mirror effect which is good to photograph the skyline reflecting in it. If you are after such a photo though go early or late otherwise you will have hundreds of small children in it. :)","Written July 4, 2019"

France,Place de la Bourse,Magnificent sight,"Awe inspiring old style buildings with old fashioned grandeur. The place oozes ‚Äúold money‚Äù from bygone times.
Everything very well maintained and photo genetic.
A must see !",
France,Place de la Bourse,Stunning 18th Century Plaza,"La Place de la Bourse in central Bordeaux is a particularly beautiful stretch of the elegant frontage along the left bank of the Garonne. The square faces out towards towards the Miroir d'Eau and is the backdrop for Bordeaux's impressive imagery.

The area itself is historic. It took 25 years to build from start to finish until the unveiling in 1745. It was always designed to be grand though the intended royal connections did not last. The name of course relates to the trading of stocks in the city.

The maritime stock exchange sadly no longer exists but the grand structures around the square still do. They are impressive sandstone buildings in great shape after the restoration of the square in 2004. They gleam and are beautiful, especially the two larger buildings on either side despite some repair work being carried out.

The building in the centre is slightly less attractive but is still a pleasant backdrop. At night the three are stunning thanks to the deliberate lighting. Against a dark sky the place is beautifully lit.

The actual square itself is also appealing. The cobble stones are all a little too aligned but nevertheless they are an enjoyable feature. The fountain is ok but not as impressive as the rest of the square, especially given the water doesn't seem to flow by mid April.

Place de la Bourse is easy to get to either walking or using the tram stop nearby. It is an essential part of Bordeaux and a wonderful element in the city.","Written April 19, 2019"

France,La Petite France,Post Card City,"Quartier de la Petite in Grand Ile, Strasbourg is a UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE since 1988. During Medieval Times this area of Strasbourg was home to many guild craftsmen especially tanners. The Maison des Tanneurs (Home of the Tanner's Guild) dated 1572 lies in the heart of La Petite and is still erect today. It is an area of canals and bridges, as well with clean maintained cobblestone streets. The Pont du Faisan is a swing bride near the center of town along with many footbridges. There are many 16th-17th century picture book half-timber homes to look at with many flower boxes hanging from their windows. When the buildings are lit after dark it presents a fairytale atmosphere. One of the buildings to look for is the House of Kammerzell dated 1427.

The Cathedral of Notre-Dame is the centerpiece of the Munsterplatz. Here you will find the cathedral museum, restaurants, cafes, bakeries and shops. If you are interested in authentic Alsace Lorriane cuisine. The restaurant, Au Vieux, is a good bet. It is a block from the cathedral tucked in with a lot of restaurants around it.

Another area of Strasbourg worth exploring features the Barrage Vauban (16th century guard towers)on both sides of the river with a long footbridge crossing. This area provides panoramic views of the Pont Couverts and is used by tourists as their starting point to view La Petitie. Strasbourg is a post card city full of enchantment, history and great restaurants.",

France,La Petite France,The most beautiful part of Strasbourg,"The ‚ÄúLa Petite France‚Äù district, with its canals, narrow streets and half-timbered houses, is the most beautiful district in Strasbourg.
The entire district is a pedestrian zone with many small shops, boutiques, antique shops and numerous restaurants and cafes. Some of the restaurants and cafes have beautiful terraces, so you can sit outside comfortably in good weather.

Worth seeing are the M√ºnsterplatz (Place de la Cath√©drale) with the Cathedral Notre-Dame Strasbourg, the Palais Rohan (the former city residence of the Strasbourg bishops), the Gutenbergplatz (named after the inventor of the printing press), the historic Barrage Vauban (with panoramic terrace and view on Pont Couverts).

Strasbourg is ""nice"", everything okay, but Strasbourg certainly cannot keep up with the ""big European cities"". It has too less to offer. 1-2 days, that's enough. It was on my way, but I would not recommend it for travel from far to there. You may be disappointed. It is nothing special.
If you are traveling by car, be careful not to get a ticket. I found the procedure extremely complicated. To pay retrospectively online - in the age of technology, only one website in French - sad and annoying.",
France,La Petite France,Bed bugs,"Had it not been for the colony of bed bugs that overtook us on December 26, our review would have been a 5-star one in the context of the hotel's official 3-star rating. The location is superb, the young staff was cheerful and attentive and the rooms though small were manageable. Unfortunately, due to the bed bug invasion, this episode left us visiting the Emergency Ward of a local hospital and generated a lot of work on the part of the staff and ourselves in eradicating the intruders. The hotel did change our room but relocated us immediately next door which did concern us. They also laundered all our belongings and paid for dry cleaning of some garments. However, we were astounded to hear the hotel manager suggest that we were responsible for bringing the bugs with us. Upon returning home, we contacted Accor Hotels to ask for some compensation on two separate occasions (using their website feed-back form) but received no response in the three months that since ensued. This is unfortunate since we have using Ibis hotels for well over 20 years, often annually, and could not even merit a reply one way or another. Further, this was a two-week stay, over the X-mas period, that marred our holiday including the fact that it generated unforeseen expenses. We are both seniors. Any compensation would have demonstrated good will.","Written May 25, 2020"

France,La Petite France,The place to visit!!,"Petite France is a historic quarter of the city of Strasbourg in eastern France. It is located at the western end of the Grande √éle, which contains the historical centre of the city. The name Petite-France (""Little France"") was not given for patriotic or architectural reasons. It comes from the ""hospice of the syphilitic"" (Hospice des V√©rol√©s, in French), which was built in the late fifteenth century on this island, to cure persons with syphilis, then called Franzosenkrankheit (""French disease"") in German.This is the most picturesque district of old Strasbourg. Fishermen, millers and tanners once lived and worked in this part of town where the streets have been built level with the waterways. Nice atmosphere with French and German influence.","Written January 5, 2020"

We walked and walked and learned about the history of this place while learning the different locations of the Christmas markets there (I lost count of how many as one ran into another). When the tour was over, we got a chance to explore but not enough time to go back to all of them again.
Maybe next year I will return and see more of the markets and of Strasbourg. The people were lovely, the place diverse and welcoming, and walkable. We took tram to close by the market. It was a fun night but you really need at least 2 days there to explore in day and at markets.

France,La Petite France,Charming area of France,"I had never heard of Petite France until we went on a walking tour in the area. It is a beautiful part of the city, and you immediately feel like you have stepped back in time. Strasbourg has lots of history, and has changed hands over the centuries to be German, then French, then German and back again. Because of this, you have German and French influences all throughout Strasbourg, reflected in the street names, architecture and food. Petite France has saved its French influence in all of these areas. You can take a boat trip along the river, you can eat and enjoy the ambiance, and shop or just take pictures and marvel at the charming and relaxing atmosphere.","Written August 27, 2019"

If you lovemaking beautiful picturesque than bring along a good camera since you‚Äôre talented and you‚Äôll not miss a thing here. Strasbourg has plenty of beautiful sites and La Petite is sure to please artists. I wish I could just sit at one corner bridges and sketch them all. France is blessed with many beautiful sites and every cities has a different story. Strasbourg is just a border city from Offenburg and not far from Switzerland and Liechtenstein so you‚Äôll get to see mostly local tourists. While on the long bridge just don‚Äôt let anyone rushes you. Stand right in middle of La Petite bridges and get the best pictures from left to right where the centuries old Chat√©au sits on the Rhine River before your eyes.
Than take a walk to the end bridge that takes you through the pretty villages along Rhine and you‚Äôll find for more. You could sit at La Conde √¢ Lindge a Cafe under big trees next to Rhine River and appreciate the manifique views. This places has great energy with the rivers currents running loudly and sorts of characters within the community. There‚Äôs one begging with an honest placard asking ‚Ç¨1 for alcohol. You don‚Äôt find that many in France and some find their home under the centuries old solid metal bridges. The pretty florals arrangement along the bridges is typically French as same with their homes. Walking further you‚Äôll find surprises, the Place De La Cath√©drale another manifique piece of art.",

No extra lens to weigh me down. Every once in a while check your white balance and histograms to make sure all is going well technically.

In the Middle Ages it was home to the tanners/millers and fishermen and today is a world heritage site.

There are signs everywhere so it would be hard to miss.

The buildings are beautiful, but there was not a lot of shopping or many restaurants compared to other areas of town.

France,La Petite France,Beautiful older neighborhood along the river,"Gorgeous area largely flanked by the river Ill allows you to wander and get lost for a while among bridges decorated with flowers and winding cobblestone streets. The area did not feel overly touristy though it is very popular with visitors - my impression is that there may be fewer ""tourist"" shops in this area selling the usual trinkets. Instead I encountered shops selling quality clothing, locally-made crafts, terrific Jeff de Bruges chocolates and a terrific tea shop called Dammann Fr√®res. An actual women's plus-size clothing shop (Couleurs ronde en couleurs) made my day. This beautiful section of town gets busy as early as 8 or 9 in the morning in July; crowds began to thin after 4 pm. A multitude of quality restaurants in the area are within walking distance if you are staying nearby. Both the Strasbourg Cathedral and Place Kl√©ber are about 1 km from Petite France. During my stay the area was quiet by 10 pm, with almost no one out on the streets at this time, so if a quieter area of town is desired (at night) for lodging, consider Petite France.

France,La Petite France,"Tourist magnet between Pont Faisan and Pont St. Martin, especially around Place Benjamin Zix","The picturesque areas of La Petite France are between the 2 bridges Pont Faisan and Pont St. Martin and probably center around Place Benjamin Zix where the House of Tannners, now a restaurant, is located. This area is a tourist magnet. The 16th and 17th century half-timbered 4 story row houses that line the narrow lanes and the waterway provide an ambience of yesteryear without the smells of open sewer ditches and the noise of tanneries and water mills. The multilingual illustrated boards around Place Benjamin Zix inform visitors about the industry and past living conditions of this area. The spice, grain, and water mills and bathing houses have vanished from the ""3 fingers"" of land in the RIver Ill channels, but the houses have been renovated and still are used for shops, restaurants at the ground level. From Place Benjamin Zix there is a pedestrian footbridge over the canal from where excellent photos and views of these houses lining the canal can be taken.

One would think this area could be called ""Little Venice"" instead of ""La Petite France"", a name used in the past for this area because of its hospital to treat French soldiers with syphilis. The area is also referred to as ""tanners' district"". Tanners who lived in these houses used the upper stories to dry their animal skins, often hanging them out from those upper windows. They had their own pub across from the House of Tanners.

Crowds will thin out around Pont Couverts where the 3 towers and Barrage Vauban are located. While Rue de Moulins provides distant views of the 3 towers on Pont Couverts, it is better to actually walk along Pont Couverts to see the Barrage Vauhan. It's only a 5 minute walk from Place Benjamin Zix to Pont Couverts using Pont Faisan and Quais de la Petite France, one of the ""fingers"". However, the best photo of those 3 towers on Pont Couverts, once part of the medieval fortifications, is from the roof of the Barrage Vauban, another 7 minute walk.

Rue des Dentelles also connects Pont St. Martin with Pont Faisan. This narrow pedestrian lane has guild flags hanging from the buildings and many restaurants, but it is not particularly picturesque. Walk 10 minutes along this winding lane to finally reach the Cathedral Notre Dame.

We walked a circular route in La Petite France which took about 30-45 minutes. This area is a ""must see"" as it is so charming with its well preserved half-timbered 16th and 17th century houses along the waterway. We took many post-card type pictures.","Written June 30, 2019"
France,La Petite France,Lovely area to wander around,"Historic La Petite France is in the Western end of the Old Town on 4 canal locks, bordered by 1/2 timbered buildings which once housed millers & tanners - look out for Maison du Tanneurs, one of the original tanner's house surviving today - there is a frescoed sign on the side. The streets, particularly Rue du Bain-aux-Plantes and narrow lanes are cobbled and lined with quaint shops and eateries. Beautiful historic stone bridges cross the canals, one, the Ponts Couvert has large square stone towers, you can get a great view of this bridge from the terrace of Barrage Vauban, a covered defence bridge, well worth a visit.

The district was partly destroyed during WWII, however, most of its 16th and 17th century traditional Alsatian architectural features could be restored or rebuilt. Now picturesque half-timbered houses with flower-covered balconies line cobbled alleyways and hang over the canals and their bridges.",

France,La Petite France,A Step Back in Time,"This was a wonderful stop on our down-the-Rhine river tour that required us to take buses from our dock across the Rhine in Kehl, Germany. An imperial Free City during the Reformation, Strasbourg's embracing of the Reformation made it a magnet for refugees and reformers alike. My personal quest was to find the church where Reformer John Calvin pastored a group of French expats. I found it, but it's no longer a church. A plaque notes its historical significance, and while that was a bit disappointing, it was still cool to find and identify. We visited lots of little shops, eating outside of a simple little local bread/sandwich shop with a mother and daughter from Australia. Walking around, we tried some bakeries, and then found a confectioner's with excellent macaroons. Just a great time, and so absolutely worth visiting!",

In 1873, a bell tower was added by architect Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc, but only the gate in the courtyard remains from Henri IV medieval times.
The courtyard displays a plaque to the Duke de Montmorency who was decapitated there after his rebellion against Cardinal Richelieu.
City architect Raymond Moretti in 1995 redesign the Place du Capitole, creating a lovely pedestrian walking area in front of the Capitole with an Occitan cross on the ground in front of it. Around on the other three sides of the square are many popular restaurants and cafes, a little expensive, but a great place to sit and people watch. To the south of the square is the city's Vieux Quartier (Old Quarter), a tangle of lanes and leafy squares also full of cafes, shops.
If you have time visit the magnificent the 60-m long, 10-m high and 9-m wide reception hall and lounges with their wonderful collection of paintings on the walls and ceiling inside the Capitolium building.

France,Le Capitole,Yellow Vest day in Toulouse Place Capitole,"I arranged for my hotel to have a driver pick me up at the airport. His name was Dani and he had little English. My schoolboy French was helping but only a bit. He was telling me today is a strike day - jeune vest. I had forgotten the meaning of jeune so I did not understand. He dropped me very close to the hotel and I walked past the first police cordon to see three police vans parked right in front of my hotel and a row of riot police in full armour lined up across the street. As i looked ahead to the Place Capitole which was thronged with people - I saw them - people of all types, races and classes of society in yellow vests - jeune - yellow, doh!
I dropped my stuff in the room and raced out to the Place and joined the throng. The photos are poor because I could not find a place to get up high. But there were all these people singing songs, marching around the Place. The riot police were there to ensure they did not march down past my hotel, but stuck to the Place. The mood was festive and all the cafes around the Place were filled with people enjoying the event. What are they protesting about I asked? everything! No molotov cocktails, stone throwing or violence in Toulouse as far as I could see. So I joined the crowd and had an awful beer and a melon and serrano ham late lunch. The place was buzzing. After the yellow vests passed on a concert began and it looks like the old Place is going to buzz tonight. This is the part of travel I do not plan that is just so much FUN! ü§©.

The most prominent building remains the Capitole with the adjacent theatre integrated into the architectural ensemble.

France,Le Capitole,This Place Caps-It-All...!!,"This hugely impressive building dominates the centre of the city. The building has a long history as the primary centre of power in the city of Toulouse and has gone through many changes over the centuries. Today, it is the mayoral office & administrative centre for the city and is also the location for one of the main theatres/opera houses of Toulouse. To its front, you find a large impressive square, which is surrounded by complementary buildings and which is the site for a daily market. Behind it, you have a pretty plaza where you can visit the main tourist office of Toulouse in what was once the archive tower for the original Capitole building. On entering the Capitole, you are presented with a grand courtyard which gives a hint of the treasures that await you. The courtyard leads you to a majestic staircase where grand murals, depicting medieval fetes and jousting tournaments, pull you back to the days of knights & their ladies. From the top of the stairs you wander through a series of grandiose salons where local artists recreated various aspects of the culture of Toulouse and its environs in the form of huge paintings. The final Salle des Illustres is stunningly huge and reflects important events in the history of the city. It also provides wonderful views out over the Place de Capitole.","Written August 4, 2019"

I searched for the pilgrim shark which had been spotted last month - 12 meters ! - but no sign of the shark.
