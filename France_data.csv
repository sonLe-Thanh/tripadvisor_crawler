France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Superb museum,"Every time we visit Paris, this museum is always included as a must see. I would recommend booking tickets online. The visitor will be allotted a 30 minute window of time to visit. The lines are usually quite long to buy same day tickets. For US visitors, it is necessary to show the CDC vaccination card prior to entry.
The museum was originally a train station in 1900. In 1977, the building was transformed into a world class museum.
The fifth floor has exceptional paintings from Degas, Monet, Renoir, Seurat, Pissarro and Cezanne.
Third floor has unique examples of Art Nouveau.
Gift shops are scattered throughout the museum.
Ticket price is a very reasonable $16.",

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Can‚Äôt wait to come back!,"Glad we booked early morning reservations, by 1030-11am it started to get pretty crowded and hard to take ‚Äúgood‚Äù photos. I applaud the (walking) layout of this museum. I didn‚Äôt have to do a lot of back and fourth (Cause I don‚Äôt wanna miss a thing üòá) If you‚Äôre into art history, this museum has a lot of the greats. I enjoyed this museum so much! This is my second time in Paris and I went back and fourth about possibly going back to the Louvre for the second time since I didn‚Äôt finish it but I‚Äôm glad I went to Musee d‚ÄôOrsay instead since I was only in Paris for 2 days. The cafe on the top floor also had amazing coffee!",

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Complete surprise,"The Orsay is a wonderful museum in a beautiful old train station on the Seine. It has a light, bright calm feeling where you can enjoy the art. The Impressionist collection is the star. I suggest to start on the top floor (by the giant clock face) and work your way down). It's great to go on Thursday evenings when they are open until 9:45pm and there are less people.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Very nice Museum,"I was a little bit skeptical of this museum since i am not a big impressionist fan. I was wrong. This is a fabulous museum. It's really big so if you have limited time focus on the masters - Van goth, Monet, Renior etc,.. When we were there they had most of their paintings on the 5th floor but there was also a special exhibit on the first floor with some really cool stuff as well. Van Goth's Starry Night alone is worth the price of admission.

However our 14 yr old daughter was denied entry on the basis her Covid test was taken in the U.K not in France, despite it stating it was recognised in the EU and taken within the specified 72 hours.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Great Museum - Worth Cost of Entry - Fascinating Arts,"d'Orsay is smaller and generally less crowded than the Louvre, but whereas the Louvre probably takes a couple of visits to completely view, Musee d'Orsay is easier to view in a few hours - this was my impression on a first time visit in September, however, I think one of the floors was closed temporarily. The works displayed here are fantastic and generally more accessible than the Louvre on a crowded day.","Written September 19, 2021"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Great 1/2 day Museum Experience!,"We chose to visit the Musee d'Orsay in Paris rather than one of the larger museums, like the Louvre. We spent about 3 hours wandering through the many rooms and halls of beautiful sculptures, paintings, and fascinating exhibits. The famous Monet and Van Gogh painting were absolutely gorgeous! When we left, we felt like we saw a lot, but were not totally overwhelmed. Beautiful old building as well. Amazing how the old train station was converted into an excellent space for a museum. Great experience!","Written September 18, 2021"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Spectacular venue,"This spectacular old train station and its art collection are indeed better than Louvre.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,The best art museum in Paris.,"1. It was my 5th time in Paris and I still think that it's the best art museum in Paris. Of course if you like impressionism ;)

2. The best pictures of impressionists and postimpressionists are here like Manet, Monet, Van Gogh, Renoir, Deags, Gauguin.

3. There is sculpture also, mainly on the ground floor.

4. Important for parents! Children have free entry and for you as a parent price is reduced (you pay 13 Euro, not 16 Euro).

5. Moving around is also quite easy. It's not so easy to get lost like in other museums of Paris.","Written September 10, 2021"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Amazing Collection,"This is the finest collection of Impressionist Art in the world, I believe. Buy your tickets for an early entrance as the Museum gets crowded even in Covid times. The audioguide is well done and worth the cost. But don‚Äôt try to listen to every available work or you will be exhausted before seeing all the highlights. Start at the top since that is the most popular and becomes crowded. There is an outdoor space near the coffee shop that was a good place to take a break and enjoy the Paris skyline. If you only go to one museum besides the Louvre, make it this one!","Written September 9, 2021"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Full of Impressionist art!,"This museum has a truly massive collection. If you like Impressionist art this is where you want to go. Paintings by Monet and Renoir as well as a number of original Van Gogh works grace the walls everywhere you look. My personal favorite are the massive paintings that can be found on the bottom floor. I believe that the first Sunday of the month is free and there are a few other discounts that you can get. They are listed on the website. All in all, this place is worth a visit if you appreciate good art.","Written September 8, 2021"

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Iconic paintings,"There are few iconic paintings that anyone, from anywhere, from any age and from any culture, can recognise. The Musee d'Orsay has all of them. The incredible value of this museum is all there. You saw them in postcards, school books, social meme, on TV, everywhere (!), here you'll see them for real and they're breathtaking. A thorough visit may take 2-3 hours, but to see the world-known masterpieces, one hour and a half may well be enough. Top floor, plus some paintings hidden on the lower floors... go find them ;-) Don't miss Rodin's Gates of Hell. PS: 5th visit to date.","Written September 8, 2021"

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,The photo of the exterior of the Musee d'Orsay !,"The exterior of the Musee d'Orsay is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful buildings in Paris. The imposing building was built in 1900 and sits on the left bank of the River Seine. The original use of the building was for a railroad station. The Musee has a second building attached in the back. In the photo, you can see the half-circle exterior of the other building. Attached is a photo of the interior of the half-circle building.

As you look at this photo, the entrance is around the corner of the right side of the building. The stunning photo also includes a church (Basilica of Saint Clotide) and the ""Les Invalides"" building (with gold dome) which includes Napoleon's Tomb and the the beautiful chapel.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Absolute must see if you like Impressionism,I enjoy the Musee d'Orsay so much that I've visited it multiple times. The entire collection is impressive but the impressionist collection is especially wonderful. The size of the museum is large enough without feeling overwhelming and the atmosphere is very cool. My tip would be to go early and start on the top floors (impressionist and post-impressionist collection) and you will have considerably fewer crowds.,"Written August 29, 2021"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Great place üëå,"The Orsay Gallery is a great place to enjoy impressionist works. On the first floor, there are many sculpture on display. The building of Orsay Gallery is one of the three great art treasures of nowadays.","Written August 28, 2021"

But just like IKEA, it seems, expect to have to go through everything to get where you want to go. Fantastic museum, even for just the architecture. Plenty of the impressionists' and post impressionists' work on display here. Allow plenty of time. Free cloakroom. Audio guides are good but it seems there isn't commentary on a lot in the museum - all the important ones have some commentary. Overall, a wonderful Museum.",

Great crowd management due to Covid-prevention rules meant that it did not get too busy while we were there.","Written August 22, 2021"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Excellent Art Museum Without The Hassle Of That More Famous One,"Absolutely no lines here and they have some outstanding art, especially from the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists, the original ""Dr. Gachet"" being probably my favorite.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Extraordinary - from a golden ancient era - building!!,"What used to be a railway station and a hotel has now turned into a museum. Such an impressive building, which was built on a golden era, where the architects surely took the extra step in designing an over the top building.

This is a must see while in Paris, not only because of the amazing art collections it features from time to time, but also as an architectural monument, a piece of art by itself! Lovely to observe from the outside at all times of the day and night throughout the year.",
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Even the teen loved it.,"I like the size compared to the Louvre. Like most of the museums in Paris, the building is beautiful. There's a lot to look at, spent 3 hours inside. We went on the first Sunday of the month, which is free (but you still need to make a reservation). It was more crowded than I thought, but it was the free day.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Better hygiene needed,"Excellent museum, for sure.....
YET in this review, I'd like to nudge museum administration about the quality of toilet facilities -- the 3 women's toilets on the 6th floor (yes, only 3) were poorly equipped (all missing paper).

For a popular, top-notch Paris museum open to the public who pay for the privilege of entering,it is ""la moindre des choses"" to offer a decent standard of hygiene to those who come to the museum.","Written July 1, 2021"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,One of my favorite museums,"Museum is really fantastic. I was so impressed of such a big magic collection of the biggest painters and artists.

Lovely restaurant inside (closed for Covid, so check before you go).","Written June 29, 2021"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Great experience !!!,"The entire experience is WOW factor! The history of the building itself is amazing, it is just so spectacularly beautiful that is difficult to believe that someone actually wanted to demolish it - thank goodness it was preserved and converted to a museum. The art collection is just so impressive, there really does have to be something in here to please everyone. The collection of art nouveau furniture is greater than anything I have ever seen and the collection of impressionist work is the most impressive point for my visit. Just so overwhelmed to see some of the works I have in print at home, actually hanging here on the walls - just wonderful really. Loved every minute of it.","Written June 20, 2021"

The art collection is just so impressive, there really does have to be something in here to please everyone. The collection of art nouveau furniture is greater than anything I have ever seen and the collection of impressionist work is the most impressive point for my visit.

This was the most enjoyable visit every. With no Foreign tourists in Paris, we found the museum almost completely to our own. We arrived at 10, stayed several hours and never had a crowd. We are able to enjoy the art especially the Impressionists art without the push of others around you. Ate in the cafe and it too was very quiet and relaxed.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Why is Orsay better than the Louvre?,"The Paris commune of 1871, the world's fair of 1900, and President Pompidou contributed to the creation of Orsay. The Orsay Palace burned down during the Commune. The Paris-Orleans railway station was built for the world's fair. When the station became indecently small for long post-war trains, it was decided to demolish it. However, the successor of the legendary de Gaulle, President Pompidou, decided to save it and supported the project of creating a Museum here. The Museum was given its former name, and the monstrous Museum of modern art was named after Pompidou. Pompidou did not wait for the opening of the Museum and died, and the Orsay Museum was opened 16 years later, not even under his successor Giscard d‚Äô√âstaing, and in the time of Mitterrand. The French conquerors and millionaires collected so many works of art that there was no Museum of suitable size, so they were divided into 3: the Louvre, the Orsay and the Pompidou. Orsay inherited art from the revolution of 1848 to the beginning of the first world war in 1914. The Louvre contained all the art before the European revolution. Its collection is huge and filled with world masterpieces, but there is one cardinal advantage of the Orsay over the Louvre in the eyes of tourists. You can get to Orsay for free throughout the year on the first Sunday of the month, and to the Louvre only on Bastille day on July 14! There is a difference. The Orsay Museum is difficult to see in one visit, so it's worth setting priorities. However, the Louvre can not be viewed in principle. After waiting in line for an hour and a half on the first Sunday, you get to the first floor in the Central hall filled with sculptures, where there are many sculptures of Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux. Paintings of Ingres and Delacroix Romantica is a side gallery on the right. The realists millet and Courbet are in the gallery opposite. The main hits here are Millet's ""The Gleaners"" and two paintings by Courbet, a revolutionary in life (a member of the Paris commune) and in painting ""A Burial At Ornans""and ""tThe Origin of the World "". The revolutionary nature of the ""A Burial At Ornans"" is that in the multi-figure composition Courbet showed not historical figures or religious figures, but ordinary peasants. The Origin of the World is striking even now in the age of porn sites. The artist's irony is embedded in the title of the picture, because the female vagina is frontally depicted on it. 2 years ago, the hypothesis that the model on the canvas is Courbet's mistress was refuted. From the correspondence of Alexander Dumas-son with George Sand, it turned out that the model was a Parisian dancer-concubine of a Turkish diplomat. He was the customer of the scandalous picture. On the second floor of Orsay, separate from the impressionist halls, there are works by van Gogh with his famous self-Portrait and Gauguin with his bronzy juicy Tahitians. The third and fourth floors are filled with objects of decorative and applied art in the art Nouveau style. I missed them. Sofas and massive clocks do not cause me artistic awe, but as the French say: Don`t argue about tastes and colors. And finally, the fifth floor is the most important. This is where the most exciting collection of Impressionists Degas, Manet, Seurat, Sisley, Pizarro, Toulouse-Lautrec, Monet and Renoir are located. Drowning in Impressionists don't forget to look at Paris from the top of the observation deck on the roof of the Museum through the clock. To plunge again...",

If I had one suggestion for the museum it would be to have something that would make the museum more child-friendly (scavenger hunt - in each room, find the painting with the woman wearing a red hat, find the painting with the spotted dog, etc.) to ensure children remain engaged. If children remain engaged their parents can more fully enjoy the museum and gamification is a great way in which to drive people/children to action. Provide a button to all children who complete the challenge.",

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Visit to Musee d‚ÄôOrsay,Must see for any visitor to Paris. Fantastic collection of impressionist & post-impressionist art. They are doing some renovations so the layout of some rooms has changed. Tissot Exhibition was a big draw and wonderful to see but very busy. Visited with teenage daughter who did not approve of all the nudity in the paintings & no amount of explaining about technique would appease her! She perked up at Van Gogh as he preferred flowers to naked women. Nice rooftop with great view of the Tuileries. Cafe looked decent although we didn‚Äôt eat there. All in all a worthwhile visit.,
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Covid precautions don‚Äôt hinder visit,"Bluntly you either want to visit the Orsay or you don‚Äôt. In many ways, I prefer it to the Louvre as I like the (comparatively) smaller collection and ability to focus on themes rather than ‚Äúeverything‚Äù.

As of July 2020, it‚Äôs far quieter than normal and Covid precautions are mainly limited to masks. I‚Äôm assuming some of the individual areas may have restrictions on numbers that are lower than normal but the Tissot exhibit was the equivalent of a London gallery ‚Äúmid week busy‚Äù - not bad but as busy as you‚Äôd want without queuing to see pieces.

There are building works in some parts of the gallery - the signage is generally ok but at times misleading. If anything the areas that are closed help focus on the other (probably better) collections!","Written July 25, 2020"

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Wonderful Experience,We used the Paris Pass to enter. The big bus stop is right outside the museum. The museum was grand and mostly everything we could hope for. When we went sadly 2 floors were closed to the public so we only spent about 2 hours here. The Van Gogh section was worth it! They was a restaurant on site. Recommend heading straight to the back and take the elevator up to the top floor and work your way down.,
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,"Legendary art, average food","I booked an early morning guided tour of this incredible museum that houses the largest collection of impressionist and post-Impressionist masterpieces in the world. Painters including Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, C√©zanne, Seurat, Sisley, Gauguin, and Van Gogh. Wished I had time to see the le mod√®le noir (the black model) exhibit after our tour. Unfortunately my son and I only had a bit of time to eat lunch at the museum because we had to meet a group for our next tour.
**Keep in mind this exhibit was on display last May 2019 a year before this injustice happening in American in 2020. This just makes me even sadder I didn‚Äôt get to see these masterpieces; artists from from G√©ricault to Matisse and get pics.
The restaurant in the museum is upstairs and also has an awesome display of colorful glass art. As a food blogger my only excuse for not getting pics is we were in a rush. From what I remember I had a simple salad and ordered my 6 year old (now 7) had a burger and fries. I remember the price was a bit high for the average food I got but I expect that from a museum restaurant.
I am giving this museum a 4 star because I thought the food was overpriced.",

Beautiful restaurant, but if you want to book you have to pay in advance - so we didn't use it.","Written March 17, 2020"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Great Idea.,This long structure overlooking the Siene River was a railway station build in 1900 and was then converted to a museum in 1986 after it was decided to restore the buiding rather than to demolish it after the railway station was moved. There are many preserved paintings and art works. The clock at the centre of the building is noteworthy.,"Written March 17, 2020"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Free Sunday at Musee d'Orsay,"What a wonderful museum. Airy, bright, good restaurant, amazing collection. We attended on the first Sunday of the month and spent the entire day being delighted. The Post-impressionist collection is stellar. After that the other paintings seem a little dull and conservative, but there are gems scattered throughout the museum. It is well laid out and the floor plan / map is excellent, so you can always track down what you are wanting to see. And if you can't the very obliging staff will go out of their way to help you. Do not forget to check out the Art Nouveau collection.",

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,A wonderful museum!,"One of the best things to do in Paris, plenty or art pieces, sculptures and paintings. I loved the section about symbolism and impressionism and I also discovered some great artists of the past that I didn't know.
We bought a combo ticket with Orangerie Museum included but unfortunately this was closed the day after (exceptional closing, no further info about the reason) and we couldn't visit it. But even only the Orsay is definitely worth the visit and the price.","Written March 14, 2020"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,It is just as well the art is worth the effort to get in,"The art and furniture etc on show are stunning, magnificent and a million other wonderful words to describe what is in store inside. It is an impressionists dream. While the art and furniture etc cannot be faulted the entry process and the crowd size and behaviour is terrible.
WE had priority tickets to get in and while there was a huge crowd trying to get in, we noted that the line for people who had just bought tickets got in at the same time we with prioity ( and costly) tickets gained nothing.
The crowds were huge so look at what is on when you plan to go.
on the ground floor everyone go into this sidestep pattern so we all moved along together doing a side step , but had people pushing in to take selfies, with the art as a poor mans backdrop.
It may sound as if I had a poor time , but I did not. Certainly people's behaviour was rude etc but the use of the old station and the space provided was clever and allowed you to get away from the crowd and enjoy the experience with other works. Spend a day and you will still not see it all","Written March 13, 2020"

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Absolutely magnificent,"I'll never know why people queue for hours to get into the Louvre - well OK, it's most probably to see the Mona Lisa which if they're lucky they might get a glance - when this superb museum is just up the river. A fantastic building holds some superb art with plenty of room to wander around and really appreciate the displays - get the audio tour for a few Euros as it explains so much and be prepared to spend some serious time in there. I've been twice and would go again.",

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Truly a world class museum!!!!,Ou est Pompon? Pompon is the artist that created the iconic bear sculpture in this museum and if I'm not mistaken this bear is the museum mascot of sorts. This museum has it all. If you abhor the overly elitist art collection and want to avoid the touristy Mona Lisa fans waiting in line for a selfie at the Louvre you will love this museum. Many iconic works are here. There are sculptures and paintings here. The architecture of the museum inside and out is breathtaking. There are two cafes and three gift shops at least. What I did not like is all the stair climbing yo have to do. You may have to retrace a ton of steps to get to where you want to be a few times too. The cafe at the top is gorgeous. The iconic clock window offers a gorgeous view of Sace Coeur in the distance. There was a pretty long line for a seat in the cafe on the lower level.,
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Beware the school visits,"Went in October last year with husband and teenage sons ...I knew how impressed they would be as I've been before.

The fifth floor is the highlight with all the impressionist masters , apart from the two French school parties who all sat with their teachers right in front of "" Starry night"" and two other Van Gogh's pieces.
This meant that you couldn't get any more than 3/ 4 metres near the paintings....I k ow that's a bit petty ut quite irritating.
Good news is that if your children, under 24, bring their ID they enter free of charge !","Written March 7, 2020"

It is over flowing with all sorts of different impressionist artists, along with a nice assortment of statues as well. The building itself used to be a train station and the architecture shows this, and it adds to the character of the whole place. There is also a whole lot to see here and I recommend taking your time as you travel through. My one complaint is that there is an excessive amount of escalators. There was one place where I was trying to get up to the next floor, and there were at least three flights of escalators just to reach the top.

Catch this before March 1st 2020, when it will be gone!","Written February 15, 2020"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Not to be missed for fans of Van Gogh and Impressionist artists,"If you're a fan of Van Gogh and Impressionist artists like Monet, the d'Orsay should definitely be on your list. So many incredible artworks to see including pretty much a whole room for Van Gogh and some pretty amazing sculptures including the original Statue of Liberty and a Rodin work featuring the Thinker. So much to look at and the audio guide really adds to the experience by explaining what artworks mean/their significance.

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Must visit,"Well, having studied the Impressionism and Post-Impressionism movements I was really eager to visit this museum and it didn't disappoint. It was such a great pleasure to finally contemplate all paintings that I only knew from books!!
The museum has two small shops and 3 cafes inside to ensure you can spend a long time in there.
Only downside for me was finding rooms and directions was not straight-forward. The layout of the museum kind of makes you to walk back and forth between aisles and rooms so you have to keep an eye on the map to ensure you're not missing anything. Probably doing a bit of planning before the visit might help with this.","Written February 14, 2020"

This is the epicentre of impressionism in Paris. Even though it was free day the crowds weren't as big as you would expect, we only queued for 20 minutes and it was quite a relaxed and civilised affair. Once inside - we made a beeline, to the impressionist gallery to see the likes of Manet, Monet, Renoir, Degas and C√©zanne artworks, just as fabulous as ever.",

France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Great museum in an old train station,"Beautiful museum in an old train station. It's one of those museums where you look at all the art and yet, you're still amazed that the building is so beautiful but it doesn't take away from the beauty of the art. Lots of amazing pieces to see. They have some permanent collections but also rotating and changing collections every so often. They also have a restaurant that leads to a balcony with a nice view of the city.","Written February 9, 2020"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,Make sure you have time to do this justice!,"Despite two floors being out of service for works, it took a while to get round this museum. Study the plan well and make sure you don't miss any of the galleries. It would be easy to miss exhibits here, go through the gallery on the top floor from the shop end, and make sure you go beyond the cafe to the galleries beyond! We bought a joint advance ticket combined with the Orangerie, and were were glad we went there first as woks there meant we only needed a short visit to see the Monet Water lilies and could move on the the Musee d'Orsay. Orangeries opens at 9 so there is time to go there and get to d'Orsay just after it opens (9.30).","Written February 9, 2020"
France,Mus√©e d'Orsay,"Two clocks, no waiting!!","Thankfully, Paris did not implode their palatial central railroad station to build a modernist sporting arena (yes, I'm looking at you New York!) but instead have invested the space with the finest of fine art of the past 150 years.
Clearly the life-altering visual orgy focuses on the upper level collection of impressionist, neo & post-impressionist art. Basically, every masterpiece Albert Barnes didn't bring to America (Philly reference here!) hangs here in unequaled density and quality.
If there is a single building in Paris which might inform urban architects as to beauty, context and restoration; this is the one. Sadly, its lessons have fallen on deaf ears.
PRO TIP: There is a >half-hour wait for students to Instagram themselves in front of the iconic giant glass clock-face. But, there are two such faces...the other is in the cafe, excellent service and even a door to the roof-deck, no waiting!","Written February 9, 2020"

It gets very hot in the summer but Old town Nice is blessed with many shade trees and the breeze from the sea is welcomed.. Small unique shops that sell local soaps, boutique clothing and perfumes can be found. There are also some more modern shops.

It's replete with history and is a delight through which to walk, especially when the tourists are not yet there and when they have left for the day. By day, it's very different than in the evening. During the day, shops are open with displays of product in the pedestrian street areas; at night, when shops are closed, they are barricaded shut and you would never know anything at all was there - no glass shop windows that just go dark after closing time.

France,Old Town,Really more of a summary of what blew me away about Nice...Three Takeaways ( and then some ) ...,"I did plenty of research, boned up on my French, packed for the French Riviera...
Little did I know I'd touch down in a laid back beach town.
I was greeted with fellow travelers in shorts & flip flops.
English was readily spoken especially after I showed my less than stellar accent.
It was much more affordable in almost every way...
So some tips....
Bring water shoes or flip flops for the pebble beaches.
Be ready for amazingly affordable Italian, French and pretty much any other type of food you wish to eat...
(a great 6 euro pizza, a 1 star Michelin rest where we had a Filet with Foie Gras sauce that would have been $30 for the Foie alone in Chicago, but was $30 total therewith tasty vegetables and potatoes )
There were 188 Michelin restaurants in Nice a town of barely over 300k people...amazing!
You can eat Lunch at the 3 star Louis the 15th in Monaco than many 1 star Prix Fixe meals here in the states, and you get the added bonus of overlooking the Monte Carlo casino and the blue. blue Mediterranean.
Ride from Nice to Monaco for 1.5 euros ( taxi or uber think 50 to 100 euros ) a steal the view alone is priceless.
Be nice and the language barrier will become virtually non-existent.
Be ready to walk bring the comfiest of shoes and comfy stylish clothing.
It's hard to get lost here... it's compact and the water lends a nice (no pun intended) landmark.
Do visit all the tourist spots.. they're frequented for a reason !
Most of all don't rush, take your time to enjoy the perfect weather, warm wonderful people, and the Light... like no other I've experienced.... again there is a reason so many famous painters flocked to the south of France !
Public transit is great, and reliable.
Rent an Electric scooter if you need to cover more ground but still want the experience of not being in a bus.
Taxi's were the one spendy thing we found there... the streets force then to take the long way round.
Tram from the airport to the promenade and close enough to oldtown.
(2 euros a cab ride could be 30-50 euros )
I'd go back in a heartbeat, and I'd take even more time to smell the flowers...
Lastly the train station while being very efficient was not the easiest for non french speakers and was CROWDED... research your ride... I found out almost too late that the train to Avignon ( highly recommended for an over night trip ) was really the train to Paris even though my ticket made no mention of it.
So to recap,
Little to no language barrier
Cheaper than I thought
More laid back then I could have imagined.
Oh and no customs to pass though upon arrival ( we transferred in Portugal ) so off the plane straight to the tram and 1.5 blocks to our hotel after a 15 min ride )
For budget travelers we used Orbitz to book hit it over Labor day weekend here, and for a more than decent hotel with great staff 1 block off the promenade mid way down ( 1 block from the world famous Negresco hotel ) was under $1k per person for 10 days air, hotel taxes included.
WHAT's not to LOVE !
J'aime Nice !
Oh I have to mention Old Town since it's under this section...
Loved it... had amazing food again for not crazy money, found great small shops, and again warm wonderful people ( and the Gelato .... pretty amazing too !)",

The influence of Belle √âpoque architecture is ubiquitous in Nice .When these magnificent properties were first built, the majority were painted cream and white so they would have stood proud in the sunshine ‚Äì self-important, akin to giant wedding cakes. But now, one hundred or so years on, most of them have mellowed pleasingly and they create a certain ambiance of grandeur tinged with nostalgia.",

France,Old Town,Most popular areas of the city,"Nice Old Town is one of the most popular areas of the city. There is a lively atmosphere in this area both day and night and really nothing to see here. You can choose to wander around the Old Town area with no neat plan, enjoy the look of the old buildings and stop at some of the shops on the way, or you can follow a pre-planned itinerary to see some of Nice's most prominent sights. If you are interested, you can also join a guided tour of the area of Nice Old Town and Castle Hill.

In the past, Nice's old town was detached from the new city, as the Paillon River crossed between the two sections. In 2013, the two parts of the city joined together through the Promenade du Paillon Promenade, a charming promenade adorned with trees, plants, ponds and beautiful fountains. This is your entry point to the ancient city of Nice. From there, proceed to rue St Fran√ßois de Paule, which is packed with specialty shops. After a short time you will see on your right the Nice Opera House. It is an impressive Italian-style building built in 1881. Continue straight until you reach a street called Cours Saleya. It is the busiest street in Old Nice. In the morning, the street is filled with stalls and becomes an open flower market, which also offers some fruits and vegetables. When you reach the end of the street, we recommend that you turn right, return to the shoreline and continue east until you turn left onto the 300 steps leading up to Castle Hill. There is also the option of getting on the elevator if you prefer. The hill rises to 92 meters above sea level, making it in the years past a particularly strategic military spot, overlooking Nice Bay. The hilltop castle was used between the 11th and 18th centuries, but was destroyed in 1706. Today, all that remains on the hilltop are the remains of the ruined castle and, of course, spectacular views of the surrounding area.","Written October 17, 2019"

In contrast to the narrow streets of old town, the streets lining the beach are broad and open and lined with great looking hotels. We had plenty of time to shop, poke around, and visit the beach but no time for eating on this part of the tour.

From about 1-2 pm, those stalls are broken down, the street is WASHED, and the center is re-set with tables and shade extending the seating for the myriad of restaurants up and down the street. At night, some additional stands & restaurants (e.g., gelato) are opened with some restaurants provide music making it a one-stop party for locals and tourist alike.",

Half the price of hop-on ColorBus, AND saves you 100 vertical feet (10 stories high) of stair and hill climbing vs the ColorBus stop at Notre Dame.
The 60 bus runs every 15 minutes or so, needs no tickets and stops at Notre Dame at the same hilltop stop as Petit-Train. The 60 bus runs from virtually the same Old Port stop (near Metro Vieux Port stop) where both Petit-Train and ColorBus also stop.
And if you take the #60 bus down from Notre Dame, it passes by (and also stops at) old port and goes right to the MUCEM museum - very handy!

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,A must visit,"Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde is a beautiful building standing tall at the highest peak of the old city. It was built in a couple of different styles, one of which is the lovely Neo-Byzantine style. The history of the church goes back to around the 12th or 13th centuries. It started off as a small church and because of its high location became a sort of symbol, particularly for sailors, who ended up making offerings of thanks after surviving shipwrecks. This also explains the presence of small boat offerings which hang around the interior of the church. The present building is actually a kind of extension of the original smaller church, and was built in the second half of the 19th century. The interior of the church is absolutely stunning and the exterior is also beautiful. The views from the top of the hill where the church is located are really wonderful and panoramic. You can see practically the whole city down below. We walked up the hill and this took us quite a while, but it was pleasant. many people, however, prefer to either drive or catch the bus or tourist ""train"" to the top.",

Entrance to the basilica is free and it certainly warrants a visit if you like history, architecture, art or grandeur. The coral and white striped arches reminded me of the churches in southern Spain which have Christian/Islamic influences - quite unique.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Regent Cruise Marseille Shore Excursion guide Day 2. Part 4,"The Basilique Notre Dame dela Garde started in 1214 when a priest of Marseilles whose first name was Pierre erected a small sanctuary dedicated to the Virgin Mary upon the rocky triangle forming the top of a 161 metre-high hill facing the town of Marseille, which was very small at the time.

In the 16th century the chapel is embodied within a fortress. Francis 1st came to Provence and decided to build two fortresses in Marseilles: one on the island of If ( the famous Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôIf) and the other on top of the Garde Hill where the chapel. This was the time when Charles 5th, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, was intending to take possession of the south of France in order to reunite the two parts of his Empire (Central Europe and Spain). For 4 centuries, the fortress served as a military sanctuary and as a chapel.

In 1853, the construction of the Basilica was started to replace the small chapel. For four days in June 1931, a host of 49 bishops and 300,000 people came to join the celebrations for the crowning of the statue of Notre-Dame de la Garde. In 1934, the church was officially demilitarized by the President. However, the Nazis came in WWII and occupied the fortress.

Today, tourists can enjoy looking at the beautiful mosaics inside the church. The views of the city are breathtaking. The golden statue at the very top looking out the sea is a majestic sight to behold.",

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Simply stunning,a historical church set atop the highest point in Marseille. The best part is the panoramic view of the city.,
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,A Marseille must-do for any visitor,"Unbeatable views from the highest point in the city. The inside of the church is fascinating and beautiful. This should be on any Marseille tourist's must-do list.

You can walk up the hill if you're looking for a hot, sweaty workout! I'd suggest a taxi or bus for most people. (Or car, but you might want to leave the driving in central Marseille to someone else!) Also, be aware of the opening hours, as you get booted out fairly early in the evening.","Written September 15, 2019"
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Worth seeing,"Free entry to main chapel and free decent toilets. Admission payable for some areas. Great views. Easily reached by the 'Little Train' 8 Euros from town centre, however due to the steepness of the hillside the Little Train is unreliable if there is rainfall. You may have to catch a local bus to return that also stops at the Basilique on a regular basis. Best to get there as early as possible as queues for train get long, Basilique gets busy and it could get very hot if walking.","Written September 14, 2019"

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Sailor's Basilica,"We took a bus up and then climbed the final 75 or so stairs. The view of the city and the sea are dramatic from the top of the hill. Inside is a truly beautiful cathedral, but what sets it apart from most is that this is a mariner's cathedral. I think mariner's churches are really cool because they have lots of model ships hanging from the ceiling, either to ask for God's protection or to give thanks for safe sailings. Aside from all kinds of ships hanging, there were also planes, and submarines and even a space shuttle. The kitschy-ness of the models seems incongruous with the grandeur and solemnity of the architecture and design, but that's why I like it. Continuing with the sailor's theme, there's lots of old ship paintings on the walls. And as a bonus, for those not into the mariners, there is a really, really giant gold statue on the top of the bell tower.","Written September 12, 2019"
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Worth it for amazing views,"The basilica seems smaller inside than the imposing exterior would suggest when you see it from a distance. If you are looking for some exercise, walk up via Mont√©e de l‚ÄôOratoire or Mont√©e de la Bonne Mere. You will be rewarded with some amazing views over the city and the Mediterranean. Otherwise, there is a public bus service which will take you there from town (bus #60 from the Vieux Port).

The interior of the basilica does have some stunning gold leaf decoration that was unexpected and very ornate. There are also models of ships and other nautical items suspended from the ceiling. There is nothing really to see in the crypt - just a simple chapel where you can go to pray.

By the way, there are very clean toilets, free of charge on level 2!","Written September 12, 2019"

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,"Imposing, thought provoking and beautiful","We walked up through the interesting streets of Marseille's Vieux Port area on a lovely summers day, hot and sunny but with a nice breeze. The final push up to Notre Dame de la Garde was steep, stepped and exposed to the sun but full of stunning views of Marseille and the surrounding hills... worth the effort (there is a little tourist train/bus that can be ridden up if you don't want the walk).
The basilica was very busy (11:30am) when we arrived but despite that there was space and time to enjoy the building at length as well as take in the STUNNING panoramic views. The architecture, decoration and general feel of the whole visit, even for non-religious visitors like ourselves, was humbling, thought provoking and well worth the effort.
There is a curious restaurant on site... in the UK some people might refer to it as a blue-rinse special. The 'older' French locals had totally booked the entire restaurant... a good deal to be had it would seem.

A nice walk to do after your visit is the signposted walk to Castellane.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Grand Basilica at Marseille's Highest Point,"Notre-Dame de la Garde can translate to Our Lady of the Guard. It is a Catholic church and Marseille's best-known symbol. The basilica is constructed on a tall (~180 foot) limestone hill, known as ""La Garde,"" overlooking the Old Port. Long before the basilica, dating to 1214, an original chapel to the Virgin Mary was built on this site. Subsequently, the site was used for city fortifications, including a fort built in the early 1500's. The basilica's construction, began in 1852, utilized the foundation of the ancient 16th century fort. Some remains of the fort can still be seen on the West side of the basilica. Construction lasted twenty one years under the direction of architect Henri-Jacques Esp√©randieu. This grand church is composed of a lower Romanesque style building or crypt, carved from the limestone, and an upper Neo-Byzantine style building. The upper building includes a square 135 foot bell tower topped by a 41 foot belfry. The bell within weighs over 18,000 pounds. The belfry is covered by a square terrace, which is enclosed by a stone balustrade - an angel with a trumpet stands at each corner. The belfry is the base of a huge 37 foot statue of the Virgin Mary and Child. The statue was built in four sections and is made of copper gilded with gold leaf. The lower building or crypt is dark and somber. The entrance features marble statues of Bishop Eug√®ne de Mazenod and Pope Pius IX. The side altars are devoted to saints Philomena, Andrew, Rose, Henry, Louis and Benedict Labre. The main altar is of Golfolina stone with columns of Spanish marble. Behind the altar is a statue of the Madonna holding child and a flower bouquet. The upper buildings nave is ~105 feet by 46 feet. The side chapels are ~12 feet by 18 feet. The interior is wonderfully decorated with 13,000 square feet of mosaics, as well as alternating red and white marble columns and pilasters. The mosaics and artwork within the semi-circular apse area containing the altar are also beautiful. Behind the altar, a red marble column topped by a gilded capital supports a statue of Mary, made of hammered silver. The courtyard surrounding the basilica also needs to be toured. It contains several statues including Passion of Christ. Further, the hilltop provides tremendous panoramic views of Marseille and the Mediterranean. When in Marseille this site is not to be missed!!",
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,A must see,Great place to visit. The views are amazing. The best way to get there is using the tourist ‚Äòtrain‚Äô as it stops right outside in the car park and you can return 20 minutes later or catch any later train If you use the Ho Ho bus that stops at the bottom of a steep hill.

It‚Äôs free to enter and the view is 360‚Äô and takes in Marseille and the port. The church itself is beautiful and worth savouring the architecture and atmosphere. The cafe is pretty basic but it‚Äôs much appreciated for a sit down and cold drink. There are signs warning of pickpockets but it feels very safe there.",
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Lovely viewpoint to see the city of Marseilles,"Take Le Petit Train tour 1 from the quayside in the old harbour. 8 euros 12 and over. 4 euros 3-11.

We took the free unadvertised option to get from MSC Belissima at the cruise port into town. Get off your cruise ship. Ignore the tickets delivered to your cabin that would have cost us 52 euros and walk following the Green pedestrian footway until you teach the Port Authority free bus approx 10 mins.

My suggestion is to get the bus-train. You get on by the waterfront and it drops you off ‚Äúalmost‚Äù at the top but there are still steps once you get there to climb.

The Crypt is full of candles and quietly respectfully somber - the basilica at the top is truly magnificent and the artisans work on the ceilings is amazing. It‚Äôs free to enter - just be ready for a hike!",

As other reviewers have said the view is beyond spectacular... you get 360¬∞ views of the Mediterranean Sea,the city of Marseille and surrounding hills and mountains in the distance. For that alone it would be worth a visit but the Basilica itself is also a stunning work of architecture that's worth visiting. It's style is Byzantine and the interior has many mosaics that reflect that style. This particular incarnation of the Virgin Mary is seen as the protector of sailors and all who go out to sea,and since we were on a cruise and are in fact Catholic we took the opportunity to say a little prayer for a safe voyage. Visitors will notice model ships of all types hanging from the ceiling as well as plaques along the walls from those faithful whose prayers to the Virgin Mary were answered. When it was time to go we descended on foot all the way to the Vieux Port,the walk was a lot easier than we thought it would be but of course downhill is always easier!",

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Spectacular Views of Marseille,"I don't usually visit churches but I had heard that the views were great from Notre Dame de la Garde, which isn't surprising given that you can see the church from most locations in Marseille.

I took the 8 Euro ""tourist train"", aka the Petite Train de Marseille, (Route 1). There is also a cheaper No 60 city bus that goes to the church, but as someone who has never taken a tour bus or anything similar, I still highy recommend this ""tourist train"" because, unlike the bus, the seating is outdoors, close to the ground, and the route is along the beautiful corniche, where you see beaches, etc. Really worth the extra money. You can catch this ""train"" at the Old Port on the Quai du Port.

The views of Marseille, the port, etc from the church are spectacular. Pictures can be taken from several outdoor locations. The church is also lovely and very spiritual. Small models of boats hang from the rafters, which is consistent with this port city. Really worth the trip.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,"A tough trek so see it, but well worth it","Once you‚Äôve ascended the nearly 200 steps to the main sanctuary, you‚Äôll be enveloped by the beauty of this Notre Dame de la Garde basilica. Dedicated to the sailors who lost their lives in exploration and commerce, the stained glass and architecture is amazing to behold. At one of the highest points of Marseille, there are three excellent vantage points from which to take panoramic photos of the entire city, bay and small islands nearby. A small gift shop is also onsite. Just inside the foyer are plaques from families the church has helped following loss of family members to the sea. An inspiring visit.","Written June 29, 2019"

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Bliss Tour de France 2019,"Baking hot day in June heatwave of 2019 - extinction rebellion might be on to something - took the 60 bus from stop at the mucem end of the port, ensuring a seat. The bus was cool and took in some great views on way up to basilica. We passed some exhausted looking cyclists on the way up. As much as I love my cycling, I couldn't think of a worse thing to do today. There was a nice breeze at the top and some fantastic panoramic views. Felt very lazy getting the lift up to the basilica but nobody seemed to know about it and we shared the lift with one other couple. If there had been a wheelchair or pram needing lift I would naturally step aside, honest. It's just inside the museum entrance if you go on an equally hot day and you too are trying to stay cool ( not really cool, more like less boiling ) then take a look. I suspect the queues are never that long. Beautiful Byzantine interior with nautical flavour to many artefacts. The opposite of Dr Who's tardis as feels quite cosy and intimate for a large cathedral. Couldn't help wondering how it got built. Would have been murder lugging all those stones to top of that hill, especially in this heat. Well I suppose that's what trips to places like this are for, to make you stop and think.","Written June 27, 2019"
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,"Sweaty hike, but worth it","I do love hiking and the stairs ""behind"" the hill were fabulous minihike!

Basilique itself is magnifient, but (for me) the best part of the journey was definitely the views from the top. They were amazing.

You'll get there easily by bus 60 from the old port, if you don't care for hiking or turist-train.",

It is really nicely decorated inside and you have really nice views of Marseille. Definitely a must when in Marseille.",
France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Worth the view and free!,"The Notre dame de la garde is a beautiful basilica. But most importantly, it gives you access to views of the city that no other place do. Take the bus 60 from old port. And in 10 to 15 mins you are there. It is free to visit.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Seeing is Believing,"Way up on the hill, you'll need an approach that will not exhaust your enjoyment with the visit. I did the Color Bus because it will drop you close, so that the climb is significantly reduced. You can also set your watch for catching the bus on its return to complete the tour. Color Bus is good for two days and will allow you to see other sights in the same manner. Basilique Notre Dame's main attraction is its proximity and lofty status above the city. You can see for miles. It was beautiful in May with good weather. Try to pick days that are not too cold or too hot. Go inside the church and see its beauty also - you don't need to be religious to appreciate the magnificence of Basilique Notre Dame, it only requires you to keep your eyes open","Written June 7, 2019"

What is amazing is the views of Marseille harbor and the surrounding islands. In addition you have to be amazed at how this Basilica was built on top of the mountain. We spent about 2 hours there and went back to the harbor for afternoon tea. Be careful near the harbor as pickpockets are there.,

Marble, gold leaf, art and sumptuous craftsmanship sums this church up. It is very similar to many churches in this regard and you feel you know what toe expect before you go in.

It is unique in our known world! The Notre Dame is dedicated to rhe sea and all who sail on her. It stands on a mount keeping a watchful eye on the city, the harbour and Marina as well as the Med itself. Incredible. One aspect that makes it unique - is that although it contains religious art and artifacts the main theme is about ships and other vessels who sail around there.

That being said, it is definitely a leap of faith to drive up to the top. Not a lot of parking even when it isn't peak tourist season. There is a small train that makes the trip, but we noticed that people waited a LONG time for the ride down the mountain. The trains also tend to block people in parking places so it doesn't help the confusion. The HOHO bus also comes to the Basilique but drops people pretty far down the hill so they have to walk up a lot of stairs. Is the view worth it? Oh, yeah!!","Written April 27, 2019"

Concerning the building - nice cathedral, on the top of a hill, with impressive view of Marseille around , not too old like those from Avignon, Aix, Arles... nor recent like Sagrada.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,Fabulous building with stunning panoramic views,"The architecture of this hill top church is fabulous and it provides stunning views over Marseille City. We arrived on the ""hop on hop off bus"" and there was a short climb up a steep hill, but as an alternative there is parking close to the building for those arriving by taxi. The golden statue of Our Lady on top of the church, which can be seen from afar, looks down over the port and city. It is possible to stroll fully around the pathway on the outside of the building to enjoy the panoramic views and photo opportunities. Inside the incredible basilica are many mosaics, paintings and ship models. A visit to the crypt is also a must.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,So beautiful,"We went to the cathedral at sunset. That alone was beautiful. A wonderful view of the city.

France,Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde,The combination of view and church make this a must see,"The statue of Our Lady (Notre Dame, known affectionately as the Good Mother) which overlooks the harbour is a key image of Marseille in France. I wasn‚Äôt aware of it before I visited but I now see why the towering figure and beautiful church is a must see. It offers the great combination of beautiful architecture, the best viewpoint in the city, being a well known landmark and being an enjoyable climb if you like an energetic urban hike. The basilica is on top of a steep hill which is built up with roads and houses, but you can also get buses, Ubers and tourist trains up there. There are brilliant views of Marseille up the top. It is worth going either on a clear morning or around sunset. The main panorama is of the city, harbour and islands but you can actually walk around the church and see 360 degrees of views. It is as if you are in a plane but unencumbered by obstacles to sight. Inside there is an ornate early 19th century basilica with colourful mosaics which on its own is probably the most beautiful church in Marseille. One detail which was interesting was the ship models hanging inside the church which is testament to how the church was seen as protecting the harbour and the patronage being over those who spent much of their lives as mariners. The church was also the site of the battle for Marseille in 1944 when Allied soldiers won the city back from the Nazis. One wall has bullet holes in it. It is a religious site with regular Masses and people often leave votive candles and messages in the basilica or crypt. I didn‚Äôt visit but there is also a museum, restaurant, shop and toilet facilities.",

The interior is lined with plaques with votive prayers for the missing, sick or travellers; and votive thanks to Our Lady for restoring the sick, returning the lost and delivering mothers and babies. On top of all this is the commanding view over the town which you can drink in for hours, if you have them.

France,Vieux Lyon,Thought to be unlivable in the 19th century,"Lyon old town, known as Vieux Lyon, is situated across the Saone River from the Presqu'ile district in the heart of beautiful Lyon. The 16th century was a time of thriving business since Lyon was a crossroads of trade between Italy, Spain, and France. Four and five-story houses were built with interior courtyards, staircases, and galleries as the area grew to accommodate the thriving business population. Many of those homes show the influence of the Italians who were key trading partners at the time. Vieux Lyon is one of the largest Renaissance neighborhoods in Europe and offers over 2,000 years of history including Romain ruins. Surprisingly, during the 19th century, the old town was thought to be ""unlivable"" and a plan was proposed to build a major road through the middle of it. Fortunately, this plan was dropped and major restorations and renovations were started in the area.","Written June 29, 2020"

France,Vieux Lyon,Quaint and Lovely Old town with traboules!,"The two pararelled pedestrian streets rue St Jean and rue du boeuf are the main drag with shops, restos, cafes, patisseries, and traboules (narrow silk worker paths tunneling pass homes and buildings). Great fun to stroll and visit any shops. I could spend an entire day in this area but we took a free city tour and time was limited. Start the walk fr the cathedral and cross the bridge to Croix Rousse. The traboules are fun to explore but can be easily missed. They are marked with shield-shaped bronze plaques, while in the Croix-Rousse, it's a lion‚Äôs head on a blue background. From south to north, on rue st. Jean, Look for #54, 42, 28, 27, 24, 18. On rue du boeuf, 31, 27, etc. Note that some of these doors were locked. Good places to check out are: Boulangerie du Palais, Terre Adelice (fame ice cream), Maison Brochier Soieries (old silk shop), La Tour Rose (in traboule‚Äîa pink building owned by a rich dude during the silk booming era). We stopped in front of the oldest building in the city but I can't remember its location. In the same square is another traboule (at a corner).","Written July 17, 2019"
France,Vieux Lyon,I Miss Vieux Lyon,"We walked into old town, Vieux Lyon, and up to the Basilique de Notre
Dame de Fourviere, which is at the highest point in the city. We walked up 250 steps and 10 steep switchback paths that were the equivalent of 20 stories high. At the top, there were beautiful views of the city including the two rivers that pass through it. The cathedral itself was massive. Then we walked down past the Roman ruins that have been here since the city was founded. Since we were already worn out by the earlier climb up the hill, we declined to climb up the ruins. Julius Caesar made this city the headquarters of his Gallic campaigns. Finally, we reached the bottom, had lunch, and toured the Church of St. Jean, where Pope John XXII was consecrated centuries ago, and Marie d‚ÄôMedici married King Henri IV in 1600. Inside the church was a massive clock built in the 1300s. Some event was going on so there were about 12 French soldiers with machine guns on guard. That made us a bit edgy. In spite of that, we found a geo-cache around the corner from the church. Walking through old town was an interesting experience that was only slightly diminished by the 99-degree temperatures. On the way back, we looked for and found a couple of ‚Äútraboules‚Äù, which are hidden passageways that pass between buildings, may include courtyards and staircases and allow the owner‚Äôs access to the buildings. We found a geo-cache hidden near the historical plaque.","Written July 17, 2019"

But this is the REAL thing. It is perhaps a bit touristy with the requisite gift shops and restaurants attempting to attract them, there are nonetheless a few genuine bouchons to choose from as well those which call themselves that.

Most of the area is paved and uneven but flat. The traboules (secret passages) are very intriguing and they are worth a bit of time to poke your nose in. You can get a map from the Visitor Centre, take a tour or just wander on your own.

The raise of the wall of prayer also starts here, down at the river side, you can walk the curved route on the way to the top, where you will find Lyons, Notre Dame, Cathedral, what an amazing building with a history worth studying. And if thats not enough, the view platform behind the Cathedral, just explores more or less the entire city of Lyon, the two rivers running parallel around Bellecour.

France,Vieux Lyon,"Vieux Lyon, so much to discover","Vieux Lyon is a UNESCO world heritage site, and well worth a visit. I have been many many times, as I live just outside the city, and I never get bored of wandering round this charming area. A medieval centre filled with hidden secret passageways (Traboules) to discover, cobbled streets, an imposing gothic cathedral overlooked by the Fourvi√®re Basilica perched above upon the Fourvi√®re Hill, this place is steeped in history. Many shops specialising in silk give a nod to Lyon's economic past as the European hub of silk production and weaving. Vieux Lyon is filled with restaurants, ranging from classic local cuisine in the many ""Bouchons"", to the Michelin starred establishments (rue du b≈ìuf has a few of these), to street food available to passers by. There are also many museums, interesting shops and statues to visit or see. The atmosphere in Vieux Lyon is so relaxed and joyful, like a little village. Unlike other historic centres, people do indeed live there.
Vieux Lyon has so much to offer, and is a great place to start of you want a taste of what this city has to offer.
Worth particular attention:
- Finding the traboules (most are unlocked between 9am and 12pm)
- The St Jean Cathedral, it's stone carvings on the exterior, astronomical clock inside, and mix of modern and original medieval stained glass windows
- The museum of Miniatures and Cinema (first room is free to visit, and worth a look!)
- Take the funicular train from Vieux Lyon m√©tro station up to the top of Fourvi√®re Hill to get a view of the whole city from next to the basilica, and also walk around the Roman ruins of the amphitheatre and odeon

Local food to try :
- Quenelles
- A meal in a Bouchon restaurant
- a tarte au praline rose

Wine tip : forget Beaujolais Nouveau, and give a Beaujolais Cru a go. Aged, complex flavours, it's delicious!",

The architecture dates from Roman times (ruins) to mediaeval to renaissance with wonderful buildings, facades and laneways to explore. There is an abundance of restaurants, cafes, ice cream shops and other shops worth exploring. We did not feel ripped off by it being attractive to tourists. There were so many French people around that we felt a part of local culture.

France,Vieux Lyon,Beautiful Old Town,"We did a walking tour of Vieux Lyon, one of the largest old towns in France, with our river cruise. Started at the Palais de Justice (1835), and on through the narrow, winding streets. We were able to go through several traboules - the city's hidden passageways. They join 2 streets as a shortcut, often running through several buildings. Originally to allow silk makers to transport their goods unmarred, used later by the French resistance to dodge the Nazis. Several of these are open to the public, but many are private and locked, only for the building residents' use. Lots of interesting Renaissance architecture - shops and cafes. We stopped at a bakery for a sample of delicious praline pastry. Many of the houses were built 4 and 5 storeys high, with interior courtyards and lovely ironwork. French Gothic style, with an Italian influence, apparently from the Italian silk makers brought in to teach the the locals residents about silk making. it can be a bit risky just walking along these narrow, twisty streets, as cars and trucks just push their way through. So many intersting looking shops and restaurants, I wish we had more time here!","Written May 18, 2019"

Walking through the medieval streets we admired the architecture typical of this area. Furthermore we also found out a typical thing of the city of Lyon: the Traboule. These are sort of passageways built as public streets cutting through private buildings and palaces, used mostly by merchants to reach the river quickly. We visited a few of them thorughout the city including the one where the Musee Gadagne is located.

France,Vieux Lyon,Preserved by the efforts of Andr√© Malraux.,"Old Lyon was preserved by the efforts of Andr√© Malraux, the hero of the Resistance, the famous associate of General de Gaulle, the Minister of culture of France. The quarter became the first protected urban area in France. Half-abandoned houses were forbidden to demolish, only to restore. 500 buildings of the district became a World heritage site in 2011. Old Lyon consists of three districts that used to be separate villages. The Northern quarter of Saint-Paul, where large bourgeoisie lived , Saint-Jean, the quarter of clergy and nobility and Saint-Georges for artisans and traders. It is clear that the first two have richer buildings and tourists are interested in them first. The main feature of old Lyon is the traboule, pedestrian passage through the block, allowing you to navigate from one street to another. Part of traboulay is public, others are closed by combination locks. The most famous traboule in the quarter is a Long trabol. You`ii find the entrance at Rue Saint-Jean 54, the output on the parallel Rue du Boeuf, 27. You`ll open the next one immediately. On the Rue du Boeuf is possible to ""dive"" into another traboule on the same street in the house 16. This is the Pink tower's vestibule. And, of course, it is necessary to visit the Cathedral of Saint-Jean. The Cathedral dedicated to John the Baptist is very important for French history. Here Henry IV married Maria de Medici and Richelieu became a cardinal . Wow-effect is impossible: the Cathedral was battered Huguenots in the sixteenth century, and the sans-culottes in the XVIII century.",

France,Vieux Lyon,The heart of Lyon,"The most traveled to location in France, perhaps even in Europe, is Paris. And there is certainly a lot to see and experience there. But to really experience France you need to see a lot more than that one city which, in the end, only represents a narrow slice of French culture. A well traveled friend of mine, on hearing of my love for Paris, extolled the virtues of Lyon as the ultimate food destination in France. I took to reading about Lyon and discovered it's rich history as well as it's alternate take on French city life. Lyon is smaller and consequently packs it's history and culinary delights into a smaller footprint. And with it's easy to navigate public transportation you can get to everything more easily than in Paris.

The buildings and cobblestone streets of Vieux Lyon (Old Lyon) date back to the 15th century and you can feel it's history walking those ancient streets. Depending on the time of year, you may be sharing those streets with a lot of other tourists, but we found that manageable and it doesn't take away from the charm of the area. There are numerous restaurants and ""Bouchons"" (family style restaurants specializing in hearty working man's food.) There are several large, significant churches / cathedrals and the Basilica on the hill above. There are also roman ruins on the hill that are worth a visit. And after a day of sightseeing, Vieux Lyon is a wonderful area to take in at night with it's bars and restaurants serving outside tables (in warm weather), Crepe and Gelato stands, and public squares. The walk along the river in the moonlight is especially memorable.

We had to get Rome, London, Madrid, and multiple trips to Paris out of the way before we added Lyon to the list. We combined that trip with Provence, Marseilles and Nice, all of which was wonderful. So when you are ready for that ""deeper dive"" into Europe I would certainly recommend Lyon and when in Lyon, Vieux Lyon is not to be missed.",
France,Vieux Lyon,Secret Passageways in Old Lyon!,Historic Old Lyon is especially fascinating because of its ‚Äútraboules‚Äù which are passageways leading from streets through courtyards in buildings where people reside. They were used as early as the 4th century to allow more direct access to the water than the winding streets would allow. A very few are still open to the public and are so interesting to see. Charming restaurants and shops abound in this area. Don‚Äôt miss!,

France,Place de la Bourse,Beautiful view,"One of Bordeaux's most famous sites, the Place de la Bourse, or Royal Palace, sits by the riverfront, and acts as a striking break from the more modern buildings that house cafes and restaurants on either side of it.

Very well preserved and maintained, I'd don't believe you can enter the palace, but it certainly makes for a striking photo, especially when lit up at night.

Arguably it's biggest draw is the water mirror located across the road from it. This large, shallow pool has 3 settings, a vapour spray, waves and a perfectly still pool which offers a perfect reflection of the palace. These alternate at a rate I didn't quite work out, but fairly regularly.

The mirrored pool also acts almost as a focal point for citizens as throughout the day and night they meet and sit there, which creates a nice atmosphere. On a hot day you'll find kids and tourists ditch their shoes for a stroll through the pool, and occasionally teenagers will cycle through it, presumably just for attention from the passing crowd as I can't really work out any benefit.

Something of a must see if visiting Bordeaux, I've got to recommend at least taking a stroll past, truth be told it's something easily done unintentionally and a pleasant surprise!",

France,Place de la Bourse,Perfect on a hot day,"This is a kind of huge flat paved area which fills to about an inch depth of water and then little emits streams of mist to about 4 feet high. This happens roughly every half hour or so. The mist is ice cold and very refreshing and lasts about ten minutes. People are allowed to walk through it and the kids love it. Afterwards, all the water drains down through the cracks and it almost dries up before happening again about thirty minutes later. As it is next to the river it gives a kind of magical and eerie atmosphere and makes for good photographs. When it fills up and before the mist starts, providing the wind isn't too strong, the water creates a kind of mirror effect which is good to photograph the skyline reflecting in it. If you are after such a photo though go early or late otherwise you will have hundreds of small children in it. :)","Written July 4, 2019"

France,Place de la Bourse,Stunning 18th Century Plaza,"La Place de la Bourse in central Bordeaux is a particularly beautiful stretch of the elegant frontage along the left bank of the Garonne. The square faces out towards towards the Miroir d'Eau and is the backdrop for Bordeaux's impressive imagery.

The area itself is historic. It took 25 years to build from start to finish until the unveiling in 1745. It was always designed to be grand though the intended royal connections did not last. The name of course relates to the trading of stocks in the city.

The maritime stock exchange sadly no longer exists but the grand structures around the square still do. They are impressive sandstone buildings in great shape after the restoration of the square in 2004. They gleam and are beautiful, especially the two larger buildings on either side despite some repair work being carried out.

The building in the centre is slightly less attractive but is still a pleasant backdrop. At night the three are stunning thanks to the deliberate lighting. Against a dark sky the place is beautifully lit.

The actual square itself is also appealing. The cobble stones are all a little too aligned but nevertheless they are an enjoyable feature. The fountain is ok but not as impressive as the rest of the square, especially given the water doesn't seem to flow by mid April.

Place de la Bourse is easy to get to either walking or using the tram stop nearby. It is an essential part of Bordeaux and a wonderful element in the city.","Written April 19, 2019"

France,La Petite France,Post Card City,"Quartier de la Petite in Grand Ile, Strasbourg is a UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE since 1988. During Medieval Times this area of Strasbourg was home to many guild craftsmen especially tanners. The Maison des Tanneurs (Home of the Tanner's Guild) dated 1572 lies in the heart of La Petite and is still erect today. It is an area of canals and bridges, as well with clean maintained cobblestone streets. The Pont du Faisan is a swing bride near the center of town along with many footbridges. There are many 16th-17th century picture book half-timber homes to look at with many flower boxes hanging from their windows. When the buildings are lit after dark it presents a fairytale atmosphere. One of the buildings to look for is the House of Kammerzell dated 1427.

The Cathedral of Notre-Dame is the centerpiece of the Munsterplatz. Here you will find the cathedral museum, restaurants, cafes, bakeries and shops. If you are interested in authentic Alsace Lorriane cuisine. The restaurant, Au Vieux, is a good bet. It is a block from the cathedral tucked in with a lot of restaurants around it.

Another area of Strasbourg worth exploring features the Barrage Vauban (16th century guard towers)on both sides of the river with a long footbridge crossing. This area provides panoramic views of the Pont Couverts and is used by tourists as their starting point to view La Petitie. Strasbourg is a post card city full of enchantment, history and great restaurants.",

France,La Petite France,The most beautiful part of Strasbourg,"The ‚ÄúLa Petite France‚Äù district, with its canals, narrow streets and half-timbered houses, is the most beautiful district in Strasbourg.
The entire district is a pedestrian zone with many small shops, boutiques, antique shops and numerous restaurants and cafes. Some of the restaurants and cafes have beautiful terraces, so you can sit outside comfortably in good weather.

Worth seeing are the M√ºnsterplatz (Place de la Cath√©drale) with the Cathedral Notre-Dame Strasbourg, the Palais Rohan (the former city residence of the Strasbourg bishops), the Gutenbergplatz (named after the inventor of the printing press), the historic Barrage Vauban (with panoramic terrace and view on Pont Couverts).

Strasbourg is ""nice"", everything okay, but Strasbourg certainly cannot keep up with the ""big European cities"". It has too less to offer. 1-2 days, that's enough. It was on my way, but I would not recommend it for travel from far to there. You may be disappointed. It is nothing special.
If you are traveling by car, be careful not to get a ticket. I found the procedure extremely complicated. To pay retrospectively online - in the age of technology, only one website in French - sad and annoying.",
France,La Petite France,Bed bugs,"Had it not been for the colony of bed bugs that overtook us on December 26, our review would have been a 5-star one in the context of the hotel's official 3-star rating. The location is superb, the young staff was cheerful and attentive and the rooms though small were manageable. Unfortunately, due to the bed bug invasion, this episode left us visiting the Emergency Ward of a local hospital and generated a lot of work on the part of the staff and ourselves in eradicating the intruders. The hotel did change our room but relocated us immediately next door which did concern us. They also laundered all our belongings and paid for dry cleaning of some garments. However, we were astounded to hear the hotel manager suggest that we were responsible for bringing the bugs with us. Upon returning home, we contacted Accor Hotels to ask for some compensation on two separate occasions (using their website feed-back form) but received no response in the three months that since ensued. This is unfortunate since we have using Ibis hotels for well over 20 years, often annually, and could not even merit a reply one way or another. Further, this was a two-week stay, over the X-mas period, that marred our holiday including the fact that it generated unforeseen expenses. We are both seniors. Any compensation would have demonstrated good will.","Written May 25, 2020"

France,La Petite France,Best part of Strasbourg,"La Petite France is possibly the best part of Strasbourg, outside of the Christmas Markets (the reason for our trip here.) It's got the timbered buildings, the quaint cobblestone streets, the cozy shops and cafes, and a great canal view. Whereas Strasbourg itself felt a little more ""big city"" France, La Petite France felt more intimate and felt like the kind of Alsace town you'd expect in the region. Make sure to include this on your itinerary!","Written December 23, 2019"

France,La Petite France,Christmas in Strasbourg. So good,"This place is a ‚Äòmust-see‚Äô list for me. It‚Äôs the oldest Christmas market in Europe. My partner and I are very grateful to be here and it‚Äôs only open for a week before Christmas. Roasted chestnuts, ginger bread, real Christmas vibes are here. French Police municipals are around for security check. Weather, however is wet. Drizzling all week. U need an umbrella and a waterproof jacket and shoes. But it doesn‚Äôt matter. We don‚Äôt mind.",
France,La Petite France,Put Strasbourg on your 'European Cities to visit List' especially at Christmas,Strasbourg calls itself the 'Capital of Christmas' and it certainly is that and more.

France,La Petite France,Wow!,"I can‚Äôt say enough about this place in the middle of Strasbourg, France. We went there to take a 2 hour walking tour of the Christmas markets in November. We walked and walked and learned about the history of this place while learning the different locations of the Christmas markets there (I lost count of how many as one ran into another). When the tour was over, we got a chance to explore but not enough time to go back to all of them again.
Maybe next year I will return and see more of the markets and of Strasbourg. The people were lovely, the place diverse and welcoming, and walkable. We took tram to close by the market. It was a fun night but you really need at least 2 days there to explore in day and at markets.
All I can say is WOW!",

Further, by wandering, you stumble upon small pockets of Christmas market which make it all the nicer. Also, the place has a different feeling at day and at night. To make the most of the place, it is worth checking it out during the day and during the night.

France,La Petite France,Historic and Lovely,"We were with a large tour group walking through Strasbourg. Our guide was very informative as he described everything we were seeing along the way. The Ill River runs through Strasbourg and splits into several channels; there are locks in some places. During the Middle Ages, this area with plenty of water became the place for tanners, millers and fishermen to live and work. In 1988, UNESCO designated the area a World Heritage Site. The name Petit France was given to the area because there was a hospice here for people with syphilis and syphilis was known as ""the French disease"".
The area is lovely with historic buildings, restaurants, flowers, trees and shrubs along the river. Our group stopped to listen to church bells under a willow tree - peaceful.",

France,La Petite France,A unique walking tour,"We toured this area with a local guide provided by our cruise company. She was extremely knowledgeable about this area. The first thing that you notice is the architecture, of course. But as the tour went on you get to glimpse what it would be like to live here. Two different shopkeepers came out of their shops, one with cheese samples, and another with cookie samples, to offer them to passersby.

While on the long bridge just don‚Äôt let anyone rushes you. Stand right in middle of La Petite bridges and get the best pictures from left to right where the centuries old Chat√©au sits on the Rhine River before your eyes.
Than take a walk to the end bridge that takes you through the pretty villages along Rhine and you‚Äôll find for more. You could sit at La Conde √¢ Lindge a Cafe under big trees next to Rhine River and appreciate the manifique views. This places has great energy with the rivers currents running loudly and sorts of characters within the community. There‚Äôs one begging with an honest placard asking ‚Ç¨1 for alcohol. You don‚Äôt find that many in France and some find their home under the centuries old solid metal bridges. The pretty florals arrangement along the bridges is typically French as same with their homes. Walking further you‚Äôll find surprises, the Place De La Cath√©drale another manifique piece of art.",
France,La Petite France,"Wander around, enjoy the atmosphere, capture memories","This city is a UNESCO site, and no area within it is more interesting to us than this area of water and beam houses. Wander around and soak up the atmosphere. Then, if you are also an amateur photographer, take out you camera and record a few memories. My gear: a DSLR with a zoom lens. No tripod. No extra lens to weigh me down. Every once in a while check your white balance and histograms to make sure all is going well technically. Walk around, keep your eyes on the alert, and grab some fascinating shots.",
France,La Petite France,A must see !,"We were short on time -so got the petit tren tour which is ideal.
It takes you at a slow pace round La Petite France part of this lovely city.
Whatever else - you must see this part.
It is a time warp with very narrow streets/canals and half timbered houses from the 15-16 century -all well preserved.The streets are cobbled and the whole area is very picturesque
In the Middle Ages it was home to the tanners/millers and fishermen and today is a world heritage site.
There are many characterful eateries and bars to enjoy.
You can also take a river/canal trip through the area.","Written August 14, 2019"
France,La Petite France,Extremely beautiful neighbourhood.,"La Petite France is a beautiful area, on the riverside with lots of cafe's and restaurants to choose from as well as little boutique shops. It was a smaller area than i was expecting but crammed full of places to eat. Gorgeous on a sunny day. We found it extremely easy to find this area even though we drove and parked here. There are signs everywhere so it would be hard to miss. We also found it a fairly easy walk to other parts of Strasbourg like the Cathedral etc. Sadly, it was so hot that we decided to miss out on a boat ride since there was no cover on the boat. Another time. Highly recommend it here.","Written August 13, 2019"

The buildings are beautiful, but there was not a lot of shopping or many restaurants compared to other areas of town.

France,La Petite France,Beautiful older neighborhood along the river,"Gorgeous area largely flanked by the river Ill allows you to wander and get lost for a while among bridges decorated with flowers and winding cobblestone streets. The area did not feel overly touristy though it is very popular with visitors - my impression is that there may be fewer ""tourist"" shops in this area selling the usual trinkets. Instead I encountered shops selling quality clothing, locally-made crafts, terrific Jeff de Bruges chocolates and a terrific tea shop called Dammann Fr√®res. An actual women's plus-size clothing shop (Couleurs ronde en couleurs) made my day. This beautiful section of town gets busy as early as 8 or 9 in the morning in July; crowds began to thin after 4 pm. A multitude of quality restaurants in the area are within walking distance if you are staying nearby. Both the Strasbourg Cathedral and Place Kl√©ber are about 1 km from Petite France. During my stay the area was quiet by 10 pm, with almost no one out on the streets at this time, so if a quieter area of town is desired (at night) for lodging, consider Petite France.

From July to September Strasbourg lights at least 3 different areas of the city each night. There is a different them every year and the show is phenomenal. If you plan to go on the weekend - -go EARLY. Do not wait until it gets dark - you won't find parking. In the summer it does not get dark in Strasbourg before 10:40pm or so. The Cathedral is always one of the locations that is lit and you can easily walk there from Petite France.","Written July 2, 2019"

France,La Petite France,"Tourist magnet between Pont Faisan and Pont St. Martin, especially around Place Benjamin Zix","The picturesque areas of La Petite France are between the 2 bridges Pont Faisan and Pont St. Martin and probably center around Place Benjamin Zix where the House of Tannners, now a restaurant, is located. This area is a tourist magnet. The 16th and 17th century half-timbered 4 story row houses that line the narrow lanes and the waterway provide an ambience of yesteryear without the smells of open sewer ditches and the noise of tanneries and water mills. The multilingual illustrated boards around Place Benjamin Zix inform visitors about the industry and past living conditions of this area. The spice, grain, and water mills and bathing houses have vanished from the ""3 fingers"" of land in the RIver Ill channels, but the houses have been renovated and still are used for shops, restaurants at the ground level. From Place Benjamin Zix there is a pedestrian footbridge over the canal from where excellent photos and views of these houses lining the canal can be taken.

One would think this area could be called ""Little Venice"" instead of ""La Petite France"", a name used in the past for this area because of its hospital to treat French soldiers with syphilis. The area is also referred to as ""tanners' district"". Tanners who lived in these houses used the upper stories to dry their animal skins, often hanging them out from those upper windows. They had their own pub across from the House of Tanners.

Crowds will thin out around Pont Couverts where the 3 towers and Barrage Vauban are located. While Rue de Moulins provides distant views of the 3 towers on Pont Couverts, it is better to actually walk along Pont Couverts to see the Barrage Vauhan. It's only a 5 minute walk from Place Benjamin Zix to Pont Couverts using Pont Faisan and Quais de la Petite France, one of the ""fingers"". However, the best photo of those 3 towers on Pont Couverts, once part of the medieval fortifications, is from the roof of the Barrage Vauban, another 7 minute walk.

Rue des Dentelles also connects Pont St. Martin with Pont Faisan. This narrow pedestrian lane has guild flags hanging from the buildings and many restaurants, but it is not particularly picturesque. Walk 10 minutes along this winding lane to finally reach the Cathedral Notre Dame.

We walked a circular route in La Petite France which took about 30-45 minutes. This area is a ""must see"" as it is so charming with its well preserved half-timbered 16th and 17th century houses along the waterway. We took many post-card type pictures.","Written June 30, 2019"
France,La Petite France,Lovely area to wander around,"Historic La Petite France is in the Western end of the Old Town on 4 canal locks, bordered by 1/2 timbered buildings which once housed millers & tanners - look out for Maison du Tanneurs, one of the original tanner's house surviving today - there is a frescoed sign on the side. The streets, particularly Rue du Bain-aux-Plantes and narrow lanes are cobbled and lined with quaint shops and eateries. Beautiful historic stone bridges cross the canals, one, the Ponts Couvert has large square stone towers, you can get a great view of this bridge from the terrace of Barrage Vauban, a covered defence bridge, well worth a visit.

The district was partly destroyed during WWII, however, most of its 16th and 17th century traditional Alsatian architectural features could be restored or rebuilt. Now picturesque half-timbered houses with flower-covered balconies line cobbled alleyways and hang over the canals and their bridges.",

France,La Petite France,A Step Back in Time,"This was a wonderful stop on our down-the-Rhine river tour that required us to take buses from our dock across the Rhine in Kehl, Germany. An imperial Free City during the Reformation, Strasbourg's embracing of the Reformation made it a magnet for refugees and reformers alike. My personal quest was to find the church where Reformer John Calvin pastored a group of French expats. I found it, but it's no longer a church. A plaque notes its historical significance, and while that was a bit disappointing, it was still cool to find and identify. We visited lots of little shops, eating outside of a simple little local bread/sandwich shop with a mother and daughter from Australia. Walking around, we tried some bakeries, and then found a confectioner's with excellent macaroons. Just a great time, and so absolutely worth visiting!",

France,La Petite France,Little Venice Indeed,"When visiting Strausbourg, this has to be the best part of the city to stay. It is beautiful! All the French, Germanic and Swiss influences, seem to come together harmoniously in this location. Peaceful walks along the river in the evening, with floating bars on the banks, which seemed to be most popular with the students. It is very central to all of the sights, shops and resturants. One does not need a car, or a cab to get around in this city. I would recommend walking everywhere. There is so much to see. I would also reccommend the boat trip that is very informative, about 1 hour long and vey enjoyable. Note. If taking the 'Topless' boat in the summer months, I would STRONGLY reccommend one wears a hat or a head covering of some discription, for the duration of the trip.","Written April 9, 2019"

France,Le Capitole,A wonderful piece of architecture that glows red in the sunrise or set.,"The Capitole (French for ""capitol"") is the heart of Toulouse‚Äôs municipal administration and its city hall, Opera/Theater. It‚Äôs a Neoclassical style pink brick 135 m long facade dates back to 1750 and the eight columns represent the original eight capitouls. In 1873, a bell tower was added by architect Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc, but only the gate in the courtyard remains from Henri IV medieval times.
The courtyard displays a plaque to the Duke de Montmorency who was decapitated there after his rebellion against Cardinal Richelieu.
City architect Raymond Moretti in 1995 redesign the Place du Capitole, creating a lovely pedestrian walking area in front of the Capitole with an Occitan cross on the ground in front of it. Around on the other three sides of the square are many popular restaurants and cafes, a little expensive, but a great place to sit and people watch. To the south of the square is the city's Vieux Quartier (Old Quarter), a tangle of lanes and leafy squares also full of cafes, shops.
If you have time visit the magnificent the 60-m long, 10-m high and 9-m wide reception hall and lounges with their wonderful collection of paintings on the walls and ceiling inside the Capitolium building.

TIP: Go early in the morning to get the red of the sunrise on the brick buildings.",

France,Le Capitole,This Place Caps-It-All...!!,"This hugely impressive building dominates the centre of the city. The building has a long history as the primary centre of power in the city of Toulouse and has gone through many changes over the centuries. Today, it is the mayoral office & administrative centre for the city and is also the location for one of the main theatres/opera houses of Toulouse. To its front, you find a large impressive square, which is surrounded by complementary buildings and which is the site for a daily market. Behind it, you have a pretty plaza where you can visit the main tourist office of Toulouse in what was once the archive tower for the original Capitole building. On entering the Capitole, you are presented with a grand courtyard which gives a hint of the treasures that await you. The courtyard leads you to a majestic staircase where grand murals, depicting medieval fetes and jousting tournaments, pull you back to the days of knights & their ladies. From the top of the stairs you wander through a series of grandiose salons where local artists recreated various aspects of the culture of Toulouse and its environs in the form of huge paintings. The final Salle des Illustres is stunningly huge and reflects important events in the history of the city. It also provides wonderful views out over the Place de Capitole.","Written August 4, 2019"

there are at least two refreshment stands to visit ( on the day we went it was 87 degrees and humid we made use of both places ) the view from above is breathtaking.
Make sure you visit both sides of the hill, one gives you the postcard view of the bay & the other side gives you the port. What you can't see is under you on the PORT side ( not nautical term ) is the war memorial cut into the side of mountain, when you visit the port keep an eye out for it, it's HUGE and beautiful.

Beware of the 'bird men' - there are men with doves with clipped wings that insist they put them on your children, then demand money afterwards.

At the summit there is a 360 degree view of the whole area, again with a cafe for a well-deserved rehydration before the trip down.

There are the ruins of the castle and the Bellanda Tower to view and of course the man made waterfall where you will be able to get some excellent photo. After visiting our plan was to head to Nice Port on the other side of the hill and this is doable but descending some steps - the signposting is not the best but keep at it and you will eventually find your way to the beautiful Port.

There are several kiosks at the top (at least one is cash only) and several bathrooms. There is also an archaeological site, several viewing points, a large playground and a man-made waterfall. The last isn‚Äôt always running and can be hard to find as the park is not well signed. The waterfall is on the promenade side directly under the top viewing platform.

France,Castle Hill of Nice,"A must do if in Nice, but do not expect more than it is","I give this 4 instead of five because I do not see how this can be the number one thing to do in Nice over the shore and town itself, e.g., if Nice did not have the shore or interesting town you would not go there for this hill!

That being said, I think you have to go to Castle Hill if you are in Nice. The views are phenomenal.

There are two ways to get there, by foot or by car. By foot is the better experience because you get to experience the Old Town on the way and the path up itself looks at some interesting properties (and you get to get some exercise - we walked off some gelato). There is a man made waterfall to see on the walk up too - do research on how to find it, but there is probably just as good a view from below.

Warning, the path up is gated and closes relatively early (check the time online), so, plan accordingly.

Warning - the drive up can be narrow in several spots, but if you are driving around Europe these situations are common.

France,Disneyland Paris,A beautiful park marred by malfunctions and terrible food,"I just returned from Disneyland Paris. I'm a DVC member and have been to the Florida parks many, many times. This was my first time to DLP. I had been made aware ahead of time that this park had bad food, malfunctioning rides, and terrible service.

We experienced two out of three of these issues while on the trip. The staff was great, really lovely people! I also appreciated how clean they kept the park. It was spotless and the workers were friendly.

We waited in line to eat at the Lucky Nugget Saloon for 20 minutes only to get to the front of the line and be told that the credit card system was down throughout the park! It would have been nice if they had let everyone in line know that so they wouldn't end up wasting time. We were told they'd hold our spot in the line for 10 minutes while we took money out of the ATM. We waited in line for AN HOUR to take out cash so that we could get something to eat.

Out of most holiday food.

Disney Studios is the WORST Disney Park in the world. Spent less than an hour there before heading back over to Disneyland. Witnessed several rides break down. We liked the little Christmas market in the Ratatouille area, it was cute and the food was decent there.

The merchandise is abysmally bad. I used to work at a Disney store in 2006, and I saw tons of merch we used to sell in my store all over the parks. It was like the back of a shut down Disney Store's warehouse, full of sale items they couldn't get rid of.

France,Disneyland Paris,Great if you like to queue,"We had a great time..

But Disneyland is just one big queue, wait time to get in can be long and every ride was between 25 and 90 minutes at all times, they are great at hiding the queues so you don't see the true extent of the length.

We stayed at a Disney hotel so made use of the magic hour to try and get some rides done.

We lost a child in Disney village, the response time for a lost child is terrible. I raised the alert in the lego shop as it was nearest, they said I should speak to someone who works for Disney not them. I went into the next shop and spoke to a cashier, who continued to serve rather then acting immediately. She did phone security after. There was no tanoy announcement and security arrived a few minutes later, the child was missing longer then it takes to get to all of the exits, so was in the danger zone. The child was located at an exit, but there is no process to alert the visitors in the area, you would expect an immediate tanoy announcement or a screen up which alerts people especially at the village is located next to the lake.","Written November 14, 2021"

France,Disneyland Paris,Was still just as magical,"This was my 7th time visiting Disneyland Paris and I was really apprehensive going due to reading the recent negative reviews. But it was just as magical as ever.
We were due to go November 2020 for my 30th birthday but obviously due to Covid-19 we had to postpone, so went for my birthday this year instead.
We went 6-11th November which was the few days between when the Halloween celebrations finished and the Christmas ones begun so we were disappointed that we would miss them but we didn‚Äôt. The Halloween parade was still going everyday and the park was decorated with Halloween decorations which throughout our stay turned into Christmas ones. The atmosphere was still amazing with the traditional catchy tunes playing in the park. The castle barely had any scaffolding over which everyday more and more scaffolding was removed.
You could still have photo opportunities with the characters around the park and we saw many of them around.

COVID-19 MEASURES
They had great sanitary measures around the park and we felt very safe there. Hand sanitiser is available before and after the rides and an individual bottle is on every table in the restaurants.
Mask were warn by all adults and most children. A lot of people wore them below their noses but were constantly reminded by cast members to wear them correctly. In the shops you could ask for a product from the store room rather then one that had been touched by people.
When queuing there are Perspex screens to protect you from others and some rides have them too.
A health pass is needed but easy to download and upload your vaccinations on.

QUEUE TIMES
The park was probably one of the busiest I‚Äôve seen it but queue times weren‚Äôt bad. We managed to fit all the rides we wanted to go on numerous times.

RIDES
All the rides were open except one so we were happy with the availability. On the 3D rides glasses were sanitised before you received them.
I love the rides here and don‚Äôt think they need updating.

FOOD
We ate in numerous restaurants and food stands. Would recommend downloading the app as you can order food and collect without queuing in some food outlets.

CAST MEMBERS
As usual the cast members made the trip. Friendly and welcoming. Always have smiles on their faces and many of them wished me a happy birthday throughout the day.

Was sad to be leaving but will return soon.",
France,Disneyland Paris,Disney magic for us !,"We are a family of 2 adults and 2 children, booked to Disneyland Paris at the end of October. Reading the reviews beforehand, I was really nervous and actually spoke to Disney Holidays about potentially cancelling our trip.

I am so glad we decided to stay. We had a completely different experience!
We stayed at Newport Bay hotel where English from staff was amazing, we weren't worried about the language on television (if we wanted to watch TV we would have stayed at home)

Food was really good, huge selection and great quality.

The park was busy (but when is it not) but certainly had the Disney magic. It was beautifully decorated with Halloween theme everywhere. We were worried that we wouldn't see many characters but we did. Yes, you have to wait to have a selfie but we just walked straight up to some characters and had a photo done (plus you can get close without queuing and take a picture if you're not fussed about having a one to one). Characters were also around hotels too

Disney shows were brilliant - my 4 year old loved the Disney Junior show in Warner Studios.

Smaller parades going around (great dragon one) but it was still great! Staff were really friendly and princesses spoke to my daughters lots which they loved.

I was generally so worried about going and spending the money we did on this trip reading negative reviews but it we had a completely different experience.

Yes, you wear masks but after a while, we got used to it. It really didn't phase us.
The scaffolding is really not that bad either... every day a bit more was coming down and it still looked amazing! I have added a photo so you can see how much is actually showing (or was, it is probably even more now)

Definitely still Disney magic for us!",

France,Disneyland Paris,"No Disney films or rides use English, disappointing for our 9-year old.","This is the second family visit I‚Äôve made with a child under 10. We stayed at the Newport hotel on each occasion due to its proximity to the park.

We all had a great time despite the covid rules which meant you couldn‚Äôt really interact with the characters and the castle is still covered in scaffolding. You have to wear a mask outside and inside while in the park WH I although tedious is done for all the right reasons.

Most of the rides were working, though if your mask slips on a ride and it‚Äôs shown in one of their photos they super impose a mask on your face in the photo.

The food was excellent at all four themed restaurants we visited in the park as was the all you can eat breakfast at the Newport.

My only gripe, and I believe it a justified one is the lack of English being used. For example our 9-year old could watch Disney channel in the room in French, German or Spanish but only BBC news or a short educational cartoon on safety in the home which was on a loop in English. The 4D Star Wars ride with the accompanying short film was also only in French . This seemed to also bemuse the Germans and Dutch who we were sitting with. My wife‚Äôs been to the Tokyo Disney park and everything is in English not Japanese.

This kind of put a dampener on the trip, especially for our daughter who was very upset at seeing her favourite films being played in the room but not being able to understand the language. Will we go back? No. We‚Äôll try Disney somewhere else.",
France,Disneyland Paris,Lovely place,"Lovely place to go with the kids, or even as a group of adults. Be prepared for a very long walk to get into the park. Even though the car park wasn‚Äôt full, we found it extremely busy (i think it must be unbearable when it‚Äôs full!) and didn‚Äôt go on many rides because we would have had to wait for 45 to 120 minutes in a queue for a two-minute. We mostly stuck to the less popular activities (carousel, labyrinth, circus train) which was great for our 5 year old. Unfortunately, it rained heavily before the parade was due, so it was a very small parade. Still, we had a great time.
Everything is overpriced, be it food or gifts, but you know that before you go and everything is magical and special anyway, so as long as you‚Äôre prepared, it‚Äôs a nice treat.
We were a little disappointed that there was not much sign of Halloween when it was supposed to be Halloween-themed until 7 November and we were there on 1-2 November.",

My daughters favourite ride was big thunder mountain and her favourite character meet was Jack Skellington, he was fantastic and engaging, he spoke to her for ages about her buzz light year costume. We were in the park all day from around 8.50 in the morning til 9 at night. We loved it so much we‚Äôre already looking at prices and dates to return. Such a magical üí´ place. The rides were well maintained. However we got on buzz light year ride at 9am and it broke down and we were stuck for about 10 mins üôà We had a green pass for my daughter and it was the saviour for our trip, the longest we waited in the disability queue was 35 minutes for RC racer in the studios park. Well done Disney üí´ we‚Äôll see you again soon.",
France,Disneyland Paris,So much fun for your children,"I, my wife and the kids just loved this place.
Well, the kids in particular, we came here the first time and we enjoyed our day so the kids insisted for a second time, even overeacted about it a bit so we were forced to come over again. It holds a lot of love in our hearts, although the only issue is that on the second day when we went back it was crazy busy and that's one of the big issues people complain about, but otherwise it's very recommneded.

What you may also need to think about when going in is food and drinks which maybe expensive if you eat in Disney village, but i would recommend going to Planet Hollywood and Rainforest Cafe and sharing food because it is such big portions.",
France,Disneyland Paris,I will never come back in busy days,"After just having spent 3 days there, I can confirm that I will never come back in busy days!!!

The park is nice, ""magic"", for children, disney, etc...

But the business machine make it detestable.

After paying the travelling, hotel and the pass to the park, you are part of the crowd, that has to spend a lot of minutes (30-45-75) even hours!, for an ""attraction"" of a park.

No seats (just to seat), no free water (many/all fountains said that are ""non-operational"", nothing to buy just for basic eating (bread, ham, cheese, salad) apart from the expensive restaurants with limited places.

Many people do not wear properly their masks (included in the attractions where we are sited close) and there is nobody to dispute them. Even worse, there are many people smoking everywhere, and also people thinking that their ""vaporised"" stuff is allowed to be breathed and smoked by the ""others"".","Written November 2, 2021"

Despite Disneyland citing covid as to why parades and firework shows were cancelled the park was busier than ever .

The parades that did go ahead were short and ‚Äú boring ‚Äú according to my 6yr old. They were 1-4 floats long with few performers compared to 2 years ago where they 10+ floats and 100+ performers.

The place completely lacked magic and excitement with the scaffold and boarding everywhere , long ride wait times and entertainment that would struggle to amuse a new born.

The rides are old and tired and really arnt worth the wait , the food is tasteless and overpriced, the staff are miserable and under trained .

France,Disneyland Paris,changes not all for the good,"I have been going to Disney land Paris evey five years since they opened in April 1992. I do not want to put a spoiler on this theme park as children love disney but the shame part is disney seem to have lost sight of what it is all about and how it was first started by Walt disney. Please do not get me wrong i am as big a child as the rest of you loving disney but Its all become a money spinning project and away from the magic that he intended. I have just come back from Disney Paris as it has not long re-opened since the covid 19 take over. Firstly the queues can be unbearable most rides did not open until 10.am. So that was disappointing. There is no fast track anymore and the staff do cram you in which we found in a lot of things at the park, the places they wanted to make money otherwise they used good old covid as the excuse. Mask wearing is for most people a done thing but we did see quite a lot of people wearing the masks under their nose or chin. That said there is hand sanitisers everywhere you go. Rides its the amount of time you have to queue and then the disappointment of the shortnest of the ride these seem to have shortened over the years and the most disappointing rides for me were the train ride around the film making part where you saw items from films how they made the films etc to be replaced by CARS my grandson found this boring. There is no longer the fun film set that you see how they make moving car chases etc. there is a lot of change and i can understand but its the magic that has disappeared. Food restaurants you need to book in advance otherwise you stand for up to an hour to be told sorry you should have booked. A simple sign at the venue in the queue would have helped, so many people were being turned away unaware of this new rule. The food areas where you could get food was so expensive and it was just burgers, chips etc fast food in other words. The main parade that was at 17.30 consisted of four floats and not the whole parade that used to be so long and wonderful. Their reasoning is they do not want crowds to be gathering.... sorry i could not see the reasoning behind this. You can be crammed into the haunted house, crammed in a long line of people where 1 meter apart was not adhered to or insisted by the work force. crammed into queues for food etc. so it made no sense. The merchandise is very expensive now and also they have made some shops into food places. Again its all about money and profit and making up for lost revenue lost and caused by covid. Its mainly the queues the huge amount of people the prices and change in rides that is the real kill joy. Children crying because shows were fully booked as soon as they opened or their legs hurt because of the long queues. Our grandson was so disappointed, we bought a three day ticket so we could sustain the activities into smaller portions but even then it never helped and we left the park early. The park was very clean this i noticed with no rubbish anywhere. Pirates of the carribbeen , haunted house rides like this are really good, Pinochio was very boring and not worth the queue. Enjoy your time there but we aware of queues, prices and book if you want a decent meal..","Written October 30, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,Disney break,"I had read the reviews before coming to Disney and was a bit anxious before coming having seen them!
Disney is all about the magic....
it‚Äôs true the park is packed. There are queues for everything. BUT there has always been queues! The food is pretty rubbish - so take a packed lunch if you can. We went with a young family- all under 6. For us, there was no need to go on the ‚Äúproper ‚Äúrollercoasters. The atmosphere was amazing , we saw so many characters ( including Mickey) and went on 4/5 kids rides each day (we had a 3 day pass ). There were 3 parades (princess/dragon and Mickey parade) and everyone really enjoyed them. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but we really enjoyed our Disney break and the kids will have great memories forever.","Written October 30, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,Awesome!!!,We visited Disneyland Paris for the first time. And we didn't regret our decision to spend some time of our holidays there.

France,Disneyland Paris,Disappointed,So disappointed. Absolutely rammed with people. Poorly organised. Long queues everywhere... Big money grab from Disney. Disney Village is looking tatty. Very expensive and a very stressful experience. Will never return,"Written October 29, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,The right side of unbearable....Just!,"Having just returned from DLP for a 4 day trip I thought passing on a few observations, opinions etc might be worthwhile to some. So here goes. For the record, as a family with 2 kids, we had an awesome time, we managed to do everything we had planned and more, yes there are still lots of things not happening at the park due to ‚ÄúCOVID‚Äù but still plenty to see and do and worth making the trip. Firstly, meals, MUST be pre booked if you want to eat in a restaurant, otherwise expect to wait in a queue for an eternity to be served crisps, there is zero urgency from kiosk/food outlet staff so make sure you book. We ate at the Agrabah and Billie Bobs restaurants, both of which were fantastic with huge range of foods. The App is worth downloading and using, the queue information is constantly updated and accurately reflects the queues making planning easier. Some rides, were ridiculously short for the horrendous queue times, the inside ones like Pinnichio, Snow White and Peter Pan are great but unless you are a super fan, they are not worth queuing over and hour for a 2 minute ride, just not worth it. Worse though are the outside rides like Flying Elephants, slinky dog, Aladdin carpet etc, queue times always over and hour for a ride that lasts less than 90 seconds. The magic hour for hotel guests, conscious the hotels were rammed due to HT, is pretty pointless unless you are literally first in the queue, they only open a few rides during that hour if you can even enter in time and they are already spilling out the entrance gates with maximum queue times already, we made a beeline for rides we needed to do in the magic hour only to find they didn‚Äôt open until 10am which was massively disappointing, by then the other rides queues were already horrendous. There were quite a lot of people not adhering to the smoking areas which I find annoying. Tidiness, both parks are cleanest theme parks I have ever visited, the staff are so quick to clean up rubbish and attentive to all aspects of the cleanliness of the park, really great to see. The hotel was basic but we didn't require anymore, it was clean and comfortable. Breakfast package is recommended, really convenient and you get away with taking some cake or fruit for the day. We didn't use the buses into the village at all, the walk really isn't far and quite pleasant and the buses are just something else to queue for. Sadly there were quite a few rides with technical issues that closed once you were in the queue, I know this cannot really be helped but it did make for quite a bit wasted time, unless you were in the station about to board then you are just herded out the nearest exit with no explanation as such, a bit annoying but cannot really be helped. There were lots of people that just dithered in the way, especially in the most busiest areas and choke points, it was extremely busy but people should still move to the side to look at a map or whatever but most just stop and stand right in the way oblivious to the carnage building up behind them, this happened lots! If you like a good cup of tea, take your own tea bags! Masks‚Ä¶..here we go. Masks are still mandatory and generally people do adhere to it. That said, as the park got more busy, the enforcement levels dropped off and more and more people began to remove them or just have them down under their chins. Sometimes in the shops and enclosed areas, you need to remove them briefly for some fresh air as the areas can become busy and hot. That leads me onto parades/fireworks etc, Disney will obviously tell you that they not on to reduce the mass build up of people in one area, that is complete rubbish. They are not on to save money, money they would have lost during the closures, which I get to some extent although the entry/hotel etc prices are not reduced etc so I felt it was a bit of a con really. They are happy to cram people into queues for rides, restaurants and shops etc but use the covid excuse for the other stuff. All of that said though, we did have a great time and all the chaos etc was worth it to see the kids faces although have no requirement to return for a long time now. To sum up our trip we both agreed it was ‚Äújust on right side of unbearable‚Äù. The gross levels of consumerism and greed of Disney is there for all to see but overlooking that, the place and experience is magical even without the full package. If you are due to go soon, enjoy but go with caution, it‚Äôs absolutely mental, plan your day and expect queues....everywhere!","Written October 29, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,Awesome Trip,"What a fantastic trip. Even though covid mask restrictions in place - still has the magic. We are regulars and this trip was no difference.

France,Disneyland Paris,Worst experience every visiting a Disney Park.,"Worst time ever. I've been a annual Disney pass holder since the late 1970's for the Orlando Florida Disney Parks.
Visiting Disneyland Paris over past two days has been horrible. Massive crowds with every ride from opening to closing having 45 minute to 70 minute wait times. Bathrooms were so crowded and fast pass price was outrageous.
Worst park was the extreme rudeness of far too many not only inside the Park but on the train as well.

We had grown men push and shove to get in front of me and my granddaughter to get on train first. I've never encountered so many rude people in my life.

In the several decades I have gone to Disney this Park in Paris was the worst. My five year old granddaughter never got to ride majority of rides on either day. We arrived at 9:30am and stayed until 8pm yet lines for majority of rides never shortened. Lines in restaurants were very long and again the worst part was the nasty rude people in the park and on the train. I was shoved, banged into etc yet not one person said 'sorry' for their pushing, shoving, cutting in line etc.

I also got the clear impression that far too many French do not like Americans as their rude behavior speaks volumes.
I will never return to Disneyland Paris.","Written October 28, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,Disappointment Land Paris,"Traveled as a family of 3 for 2 nights and 3 days during October half term. We had amazing time and we're so lucky with the weather, however there are a few oddities that I want to highlight to anyone who is planning a Disney Trip with a young family.

Firstly it appears Disney unlike other attractions has not reduced it's park capacity numbers (since covid). I checked during our stay and you could still book park tickets for the following day which felt ridiculous as the park was heaving already.

Queues on average were 60-120 mins long. With a young child these wait times are too long. The free fast past system was scrapped in July 21 so now you pay for a premier access pass at ‚Ç¨14 per person!
You choose a time to return and then you can jump the queue. If you wanted to do all the attractions in one day this is really the only way to do it and some rides don't even have this option. Crush coaster is one of them which is always at around 80 mins plus wait.

In France currently it is obligatory to wear a face mask. Masks are enforced all around the park. Outdoors and in! The security are militant about this and I suspect this is partially due to the fact they can keep increasing park capacity. This could be a bit of a unwelcome shock to travellers from the UK who only are required to wear a mask in medical settings. On the shuttles and indoor queueing this is very uncomfortable especially when you are standing in long queues.

On to shuttles, do not leave it to the last minute to leave the park. It is like a stampede trying to board a bus back to your hotel and people behave in the most disgusting way - pushing and shoving children out of the way to get a space. It is very tempting to stay late but bear in mind if you have a pushchair or little ones this is most unpleasant after a long day and obviously dangerous.

Toilets are far and few throughout the park and you will have to queue for using the toilet. Again unfortunately with children who don't plan when they may need to go it's always too late and you will have delays getting in.

You will queue for everything. Food outlets, toilets, buses, park entry, rides, character meets, parades and snack shacks.
This is again tricky for little people considering it seems all you do is queue you won't get much done in a couple of days which is frustrating when you don't understand why you are waiting so long all the time . Personally next time I will
book 3+ days in the park to make sure we don't
miss out on things we wanted to do.

Overall it's a fantastic holiday and still magical in covid times but I would say the masses and crowds did spoil it a bit for us. It's hard to enjoy your stay when all you seem to do is queue and wait for anything.

Go out of term time if you can, otherwise try may half term as the french children do not share this half term with the UK so it should be quieter!!","Written October 28, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,It's Disneyland!,"What more can you can vs what others haven't! You could look and pick faults; rides not all working, no fireworks or parades due to Covid in 2021 (and long queues fir things like covid pass), pretty expensive - both getting in and things inside; shops food, etc.
But for kids (both small and grown up!) its just a great time - we did a 2nd day to do all the tings we wanted to for a 2nd time which takes the pressure off","Written October 27, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,Disneyland is a big disappointment,"We bought tickets online, we made the reservation as requested, we arrived at the park and they informed us the tickets were canceled, nevertheless the money was never returned. Worst part is, they obliged us to buy new ones on site and to complain with the website in order to received back the money we have spent in the first place.
Besides, if you come here, expect to wait hours and hours to do the attractions! The duration of most of them is indicated from 3 to 5 minutes, and they last 1 min!!! Try to explain to your child why we waited for 45 min for something that lasted 1 min!!!!
The app is terrible also, pointless. Can't schedule a show, can't make a restaurant reservation..","Written October 26, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,"No characters, huge queues everywhere. Kids left in tears. Terrible, really terrible.","Such a disappointment; we were looking forward to this so much. An hour queuing before we even got in the door (with our tickets booked weeks ago). No characters walking around or any parades; one or two photos opps for which you had to - of course - queue. Not a single encounter of any kind with Frozen theme or characters, which left a four year old fan heartbroken. It's half term so sure, lots of people. But how can Disney pack the place out so we're crammed in queues for 60+ mins at a time, and then cry ""bUt CoViD""?! It's a crappy excuse for many rides being broken, almost all staff rude or surly, everything so grossly overpriced. 3 rides totaling maybe 10 mins, 6+ hours of queuing. Miserable day.

France,Disneyland Paris,Think twice about going.,"I hope that in writing this review I might save another family both emotional disappointment and a lot of money by choosing to go somewhere else.

My expertise is psychology and I work with teams in the worlds largest companies to lead innovation. The reason I highlight this is because I intend to bring teams to Disneyland to demonstrate how NOT to do things. Nearly every element needs radical innovation because eventually customers will stop coming.

My wife and I worked hard to make it a ‚Äòpositive‚Äô experience but it was hard work - often made harder by Disney staff and poor reliability of rides.

There is plenty to illustrate but frankly I would just not bother. I have read their replies to other poor reviews and the responses are as you would expect from a team that aren‚Äôt committed to producing the best experience possible.","Written October 26, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,Over-rated,"Staff very untrained as they coming back from Covid shut down is understandable, but the vibe here by staff is not at ‚ÄúDisney‚Äù standard. Rude staff, incompetent, unable to think how to make guests feel welcome.

The app for Disney Paris is terrible. It‚Äôs hard to navigate the site. We stayed at New York Marvel- sinks won‚Äôt drain, outlets don‚Äôt work in bathroom, wall paper peeling off in the hallways.

The food options are decent and they do ok serving thousands every day in the hotel - food is ‚Äúaverage‚Äù- but kids like it

The park has many rides out of service and many breakdowns during the day. Some staff know how to manage- others don‚Äôt.

Parades every day at 5:05 are great! Kids loved it!

In the end- most decent rides you will wait in line for 45m each, I saw some wait for 70min! If you choose ‚Äúfast pass‚Äù (premier access) it will cost you 14‚Ç¨ pp. rich kids ride, poor kids wait!

With these waiting times, you won‚Äôt ride much during the day- so the other activity is to go shopping- and they give you 1000‚Äôs of options to overspend on their merchandise and food.

They have 0 insentive to make ride queues shorter with more rides because this would not bring them as much cash.

It‚Äôs all about the money for Disney here. Cutting corners and not worth the value. If you have other considerations- I‚Äôd recommend going elsewhere right now. They are way off their beat right now here.","Written October 25, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,You need to be a huge Disney fan to get past the hassle of the crowds.,"It is difficult to enjoy the park given the number of visitors at any moment. The atmosphere is crowded out. This then knocks on to the length of waits for everything from the rides to getting a drink. You definitely need to book a restaurant table well in advance. It is all a 'well oiled' machine, but that hardly makes the experience magic. A number of rides seemed to keep breaking down through the day, only resulting in longer waits on other rides. Just the wait to go on Dumbo was over 30 minutes, and the bigger rides were looking at waits of 1 hour or more. Photo opportunities with the Disney characters was also very limited for those with children.
Average at best, but if you are very (very!) keen Disney fan then possibly the crowded and hectic nature of the experience will not be a put off.","Written October 24, 2021"

France,Disneyland Paris,Some drawbacks but still an excellent and enjoyable experience!,"There are some very good elements to the park - the usual standard of rides and crowds are good regardless of COVID-19 and they are making a good effort to maintain the quality of the service, whilst keeping good measures in place.

This included using social distancing, enforcing the wearing of a face covering everywhere in the parks, and the use of perspex screens everywhere separating households when queueing. Unfortunately, a lot of people were not distancing or washing hands enough, but I can't blame the parks for this as it is hard to enforce this when people constantly ignore them.

Queues for the rides were generally good throughout our stay - unfortunately the EMH were a little pointless because such a high volume of people were staying at the parks, but this didn't matter because throughout the day, it was possible to only wait 30 minutes for larger rides such as Big Thunder Mountain.

Now there are quite a few drawbacks to the Paris park, including that the food is not great, the parades / fireworks currently aren't running (but scheduled to return, and also replaced by some small unscheduled cavalcades), and also the annoyance of the expensive Disney Premier access system (acting as the new Fasptass), but I strongly believe that the magical quality and level of enjoyment the park has to offer remains despite the virus, so I don't feel it is necessary to slate Disney for some drawbacks, especially considering the difficult financial period for large companies - it just means I wouldn't say it's value for money. But you can still have an excellent experience at the park!",
France,Disneyland Paris,Don‚Äôt bother ! Unless you want covid,"Just really poor !
Park‚Äôs absolutely packed and the longest cues.
Had early hour with staying at The Newport but not many rides open. Frontier land was shut and so many rides and attractions. This pushed people together.
I expected covid rules would apply but no one cared. Masks off and standing close together was stupid.

On big rides thunder mountain or pirates everyone is rammed in together like a cattle market.

We have tickets for tomorrow also but not going. It‚Äôs too risky!

No rides were cleaned after use, hand gels everywhere but hardly anyone using them.

No park maps and no assistance around and an obvious lack of staff in the park.

Parks close early like 6 and 7.
Totally pointless.

I‚Äôm a big Disney fan but this has totally ruined it.
Don‚Äôt start me on The Newport hotel it‚Äôs just appalling.",
France,Disneyland Paris,Mediocre,"We‚Äôve just spent a few days in disney and it was all just a bit meh. Without the characters and the parades, there isn‚Äôt much left to differentiate the experience from a UK park like alton towers, just a bunch of rides, shops and crap food. My kids are young (4 and 5) so the characters and shows are the reason we came, they aren‚Äôt really old enough for rides, and certainly not for hour plus queues, so were pretty bored.

We still had a nice time but i am sympathetic that for other families in the same situation probably would have found the experience pretty ruined. The website and app seem to be deliberately unclear - the app lists a lot of meet and greets with characters which were clearly never going ahead. If you look on the website for parade times it links to various dead-end pages rather than just state the parades are cancelled. We had to be in the park and ask an attendant to find this out, people should have this information to make an informed choice when booking. I regret not checking tripadvisor before booking, i have been to disney paris before and it was fun, but it honestly hadn‚Äôt occurred to me such core elements of the park would be cancelled without it being clear to visitors or discounts offered.

For travellers from the UK, bear in mind mask wearing is absolutely mandatory, including outside, with no exemptions like in the UK. If you are exempt in the UK, perhaps get a visor or something because you won‚Äôt be allowed into the park, on rides or served in a restaurant without one on. This was fine for us as we understand these are the rules in France but travellers with some conditions which lead to exemptions in the UK may wish to be aware before travelling.
I see on here a lot of comments about food. It is definitely Icelands quality at Michelin starred prices! That said if you are aware, you can bring a packed lunch. Food at every other theme park i‚Äôve ever been to is naff too, so not a reason not to go.
I would agree with some of the other comments on here about Disney losing its way a bit. There are rides themed on Pinnochio, Snow White and even the generally maligned Dumbo but no sign of any of the last 30 years of Disney animation. What about Beauty and the Beast? Moana? Frozen??? What about Marvel? The park management need to invest a bit in keeping up to date. Currently we have a generation of parents like me who are nostalgic about the golden age of disney, so take our kids as a treat. But this won‚Äôt last much longer, and the park won‚Äôt last another 15 years as the next generation grow up and don‚Äôt know what Snow White or Dumbo are and want a park where they can have an experience which aligns with their own Disney memories, not just films which were released before their parents were born.","Written October 20, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,Plus size review,I am 6ft and a UK size 24 I got on all rides with no problem. I thought it would be worth writing this for other plus size women who may be nervous about fitting on rides like I was. Obviously every size is different but worth coming. As for the park itself there is scaffold on the castle but if you have been before isn‚Äôt very disappointing as there is so much to do.,"Written October 20, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,Disney is taking the mickey.,"All I can say about Disneyland Paris is what a shame. It has well and truly lost its magic. It‚Äôs a shambles from start to finish whilst costing you an absolute fortune to be there.

We had three nights in an Empire club room at the new Marvel Hotel. It cost over ¬£2500 for the three nights and it was not worth the money. The service is poor, the staff are grumpy and rude, there is no where to eat lunch in the hotel (I was rudely told to go to Disney village). We were constantly harassed to show our vaccine certificate pass just going from one room in the hotel to another, or scanning the anti covid app. We had to wear wrist bands as well and masks at all times apart from eating or drinking. It was exhausting just for the crazy covid rules, that made no sense whatsoever.

What Disney fail to tell you when you book and pay for an extortionately priced holiday with them is that a lot of things are closed. So the Castle is closed and covered in scaffolding, over half the restaurants are closed, there are no meet and greets just the ridiculous selfie spots, no character dining, Auberge de Criilion is closed, Orbitron is covered in scaffolding, the Railroad train only goes from the main entrance. There are no parades, no fireworks, no princesses, basically No Magic At All. It‚Äôs incredibly depressing to be there and I felt completely ripped off.

What‚Äôs nuts as well is that they blame everything on covid, it‚Äôs all covid a fault, yet they are happy to pack you in to long hour long lines to access a ride. But it‚Äôs ok, wearing face masks all the time will make it ok! The are queues for everything because so much isn‚Äôt open. Just to get a drink could take 15 minutes minimum.

Then there is the fast pass replacement, which is just another money grabbing scheme from Disney for tired and emotional parents dealing with unhappy kids who can‚Äôt get on any rides. ‚Ç¨14 per person to access Buzz Lightyear! ‚Ç¨14 per person to access the runaway mine train!!! It‚Äôs unbelievable that Disney think this is acceptable.

Then there is the supposed extra Magic time for people paying a stupid amount of money to stay in a Disney hotel. What they don‚Äôt tell you is although you can access the park at 8.30am only two rides in each area are open! The rest don‚Äôt open till 10am! What is the point of that! There is no extra magic hours in Hollywood studios so the queue for Crush‚Äôs Cost never went below 1.5hrs.

No Parades, No Fireworks, No characters walking about...
The main Disney Castle at the end of the strip is covered in white sheets and scaffolding!!!!! WTF!!
THIS IS NOT A DISNEY EXPERIENCE.
No discount or information about this when booking also face masks for everyone over 6yrs old have to be worn at all times (including rides) everywhere.
So all that's left is a few rides and over priced food and shopping.

Absolutely no Disney magic for my 9yr old im gutted for her.

France,Disneyland Paris,Vorsicht Disney Photopass !,"Message to Disneyland Management:First of all: a lot of these Photos are not nice, because: the quality, the light and the position is not the summary of a professional photograph. for instance: The picture with the HEARTQUEEN of Alice in Wonderland: The photograph told us to pose like we have a cup in our hand, because there will be later a cup on the photo. On some photos the eyes are closed! impossible! (Stitch). The photos with Dschafar are horrible. In my opinion, it has to be possible, to create a photobook on your photopass website with the possibility, to add some stickers from Disney, edit the photos by Size, cut and color. the onliest thing we get here for our money (75‚Ç¨) are some photos with bad quality, whitch you can zoom. Very primitive. And very sad for us, especially my little daughter...

France,Disneyland Paris,Waste of time and money,"My wife was very keen to come while the children were young so they experienced the magic of Disneyland. Even on a Tuesday out of season we queued for 30min in the car before we could get into the car park. Then we had to pay ‚Ç¨30 just for parking. Another 15min queue to check our covid pass. Another 15min queue to enter the park itself. Once inside, we see the Castle mostly wrapped up for renovation. Similar inside. Now, how do we find our way around? No maps. Occasional information signs with maps. We were advised to download the app. We did (don‚Äôt waste time trying to get a mobile phone connection - use the free wifi (and you can skip entering all the personal details)). Look on the app for ‚Äúattractions‚Äù. You have a choice of list or map. Use the list and you have no idea where anything is. Use the map and it doesn‚Äôt tell you what anything is - just wait times. The wait times are wrong. Add 15mins+ to anything you see. Quite a few rides are currently closed. It is now midday and we have done no rides yet. We planned to arrive at 09:30 when the park opened. With children this inevitably became 10:00. By the time we‚Äôd arrived inside the park it was 11:15 and at 12:00 we‚Äôre queueing for our first ride. The children, with their understandable lack of patience, are not finding this magical. Almost any way I could spend ¬£500 (tickets for 2 days) + ¬£200 (hotels) + ¬£50 (2 days parking) + ¬£200+ (meals) = basically ¬£1000 for 2 days for the children‚Äôs benefit would be better than this.

France,Disneyland Paris,"Better than the 2nd gate, still needs work","I recently visited both Disney Parks in Paris, and this was definitely the better one (you'd hope it would be). I think that the main problem with this park is the lack of new attractions. This will probably not make me feel the need to return for a while, as I have already experienced everything multiple times. I think that what it does have is good, but it just needs a bit of an update, as the last new attraction (not a reskin/retheme) was opened in the late 90's I believe. I understand that a lot of effort is being put into bringing the 2nd gate up to scratch, but I am still hoping for more love here in the near future. Thanks!","Written October 13, 2021"

France,Disneyland Paris,Horrible,"Where should I start? We came for the birthday of my son. It's been a long since I don't come to Disneyland Paris, it was called Eurodisney back in the time. I had big expectations as I remember it with a lot of magic. Well.... no magic, no enjoyment, and no Disney. It seems the years have transformed my childhood into a mirage of lies.
Let's kick-off, shall we? The management doesn't care about covid when it comes to bringing people, they do care about bringing money. However, when it comes to the Disney characters or things like that, hey, they claim that ""we are in covid times we cannot do it"". However, the shops open full time and forget about social distancing.
Prices? horrendous and crazy expensive! I remember the clothes to be good quality and unique, this doesn't happen anymore. It's all something you can find in Aliexpress for 1/10 of the price. They are made in china (as seen on the tags). Apart from cheap quality t-shirts at 25 and 30 euros, hoodies at 50 and 60, and so on, I've got more to comment on as this is not all. The food prices are as well, non-sense and my wife and myself were looking at each other as ""is this a joke?"". If the quality of what you buy is worth.....you can say, ok but this???? frozen food put in the microwave and things like that and overpriced? cmon now, please, Disney Paris management, do you think that I'm stupid as a customer? yes you do. Seeing the comments here I think they have even been polite. But the last point I'm saving is the one that has blown my mind and it's 2. My wife was cold and it was chilly outside, so she wanted us to go to a restaurant: all closed. However, we found one close to the main street and the castle for 36 euros menu..... so I wanted to take my son to the toilet and change him whilst my wife was asking to get there. What has happened today Disney ladies and gentlemen, I let it go in the park today, I won't let it go here and everyone should know: they treated her like nothing literally. Why? because she is black? we are a mixed couple (I'm white) and she is black and? they replied to her: only for reservations and she asked ok, can we? waiters inside looking at her bad and they said to her no reservations. She came to me almost crying. Let me tell you something, maybe I earn more, no need to be cocky or stupid here, however, politeness and customer service are all I'm expecting of a brand like Disney. Your staff has been rude here in this place with my wife and I won't tolerate it, not from you, from anyone. This happened here and unfortunately, I just made a raincheck and calmed myself, it was the birthday of my son. The last point from the 2 is the politeness of the people: everyone, absolutely everyone was talking to you as if you owe them something. Is it a French thing to be this cocky? every single place we have been in the park, even paying for the nonsense you sell, was acting rude. This is outrageous and for me that I had you on high standards, your customer service is 0. Apart from all of this, nonsense everywhere, no Disney characters, no restaurants, rudeness in your employees, cheap quality things, and so on. Please, review the manners of your employees, being humble for me is a must, review how you treat people, your quality in food and services, the quality of goods you sell. We won't come back for sure, you ruined my day, the birthday of my son, and get me quite sad about the racism too. I'm sorry but I can't say just 1 thing that was good and I was so looking forward to it.","Written October 11, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,A rubbish experience,"I thought maybe some of the other bad reviews were left by emotional parents who were unnecessarily disappointed that their kids did not melt down in a puddle of Disney Magic. However, having visited, I can honestly say myself that Disneyland Paris is rubbish.

The iconic castle is covered in scaffolding so cannot be seen. So there is no wow moment when you walk into to Disneyland.

There are no Princesses at Disneyland Paris at the moment, allegedly due to Covid.

There are no Parades at Disneyland Paris at the moment, allegedly due to Covid.

There are no Fireworks at Disneyland Paris at the moment, allegedly due to Covid.

Only about 25% of food vans and restaurants are open so there are huge queues for the simplest of things. It honestly takes upwards of 30 minutes to get a little snack from a van.

Now, to put it into perspective, I will end with the all important cost. Disneyland costs a lot of money so you expect them to at least make it clear on their website that the experience will be limited due to Covid. They are charging full price for a minimal service and this is simply unfair. I would say it is worth a visit if you live an hour away and have an annual pass. However, if you have to travel from another city or even another country, I would not recommend it. My daughters both enjoyed themselves but only as much as they enjoy our local attractions at home which cost less than ¬£50 for a family of 4.","Written October 10, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,A poo stain on the pants of Disney,"I've been to every single Disneyland now, and Paris is a skid mark on the entire franchise.

Where to even start? The castle is currently entirely boarded up. And by boarded up, I mean - a couple of metres of spire are visible at the top. The rest was either scaffolded or covered in plywood with a painting of a castle on it. We had a five year old with us (on her fifth birthday), and she innocently asked where 'the real' castle was. Sorry, sweetheart - there's a very large and crap painting of one, enjoy.

Next: no princesses. Not a single one. When we asked why, we were told 'covid'. Yup: Disney staff were everywhere, wearing face masks, but princesses apparently cannot get their asses out of bed and do the same thing. Nobody's going to mind a glittery face mask on Elsa, but no princesses at all? So we had to explain to a devastated five year old in her best princess dress that sorry, we'd be seeing no princesses. We told her they were all on holiday, when actually they were on furlough.

Obviously, because logic in Disney is dead, Maleficent was still wandering about without a mask on: maybe her evil renders her Covid resistant? Or is it just princesses that are too fragile to wear masks like everybody else? Either close the park because masks don't work, or make the princesses do it too.

Restaurants: majority closed. The ones that were open were dirty, shabby and some of the worst food we've ever eaten. Stale chips, congealed cheese, absolutely no catering for anyone with a food allergy. Oh, and charged at 400% of normal. We were charged ¬£40 for three cokes and two small bowls of cold chips.

Staff were the rudest we'd ever come across - screaming at us for removing a face mask for thirty seconds, outside, away from people, after eight solid hours of standing in rainy queues. If the situation is that tenuous, maybe don't open the park to thousands of people?

Ahhh - but you know where the rules all went out the window? SHOPS. Yup, no princesses (because Covid) and no restaurants (covid) and no castle (covid) and no keeping things clean and modern (covid) but every single shop was open, fully staffed and packed. So apparently 'covid' is only an issue when it costs money, but not when it makes them some.

And for all of this, the tickets were full price. There's no mention on the website that you're not getting even a third of 'the Disney experience' - and it should be in HUGE LETTERS. Nope: you pay full whack, then get a half-shut park with randomly allocated closures with zero logic.

Thanks very much for the most expensive holiday we've ever taken, that ended up with a tear-stained five year old in her best dress, standing outside a shop window with a mannequin of a princess in it and bravely declaring that 'she hopes Elsa has a nice holiday'.

Screw you all for making a little girl cry on her fifth birthday.","Written October 4, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,1950‚Äôs Park/ 2021 Prices,"We visited Disneyland Paris from the UK in Sep 2021. This was our first visit having always previously visited Disney-world Orlando.

We knew it was smaller but expectations were high with the hope of some Disney Magic to fill the gap while Orlando was off the menu.

I can only liken it to something that was created in the 1950‚Äôs and it has never changed. It was simply boring, more than 50% of rides not operating and about 75% of eating places closed. Merchandise is identical in every shop and very little choice for adults. Our very first ride was Big Thunder Mountain at 7:30 pm on 27rh Sep, it failed midway and we had to climb out and be escorted back. Magic lost and we naturally assumed being Disney we would get a free pass to return and miss the queue‚Ä¶.. NO, just a goodnight from our escort at the gate. I have never seen that in Orlando and felt this left a bad impression.

In Orlando the cast members are always ‚ÄòON‚Äô in happy mode and attentive to the guests. Here they looked miserable, were constantly chatting to each other and not really offering any glimmer of the magic. It just fell woefully short of what we thought it would be.

Unless there was major investment and enough to fulfil a few days break then we wouldn‚Äôt go back, would rather spend the money where the magic really does happen.

Disneyland Paris should be avoided, overpriced for the actual entertainment available.

As an added note we thought we could at least wander in the Disney village but 90% of the is closed throughout the day.

Very disappointed.","Written October 1, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,Don‚Äôt waste your time visiting Disneyland Paris. Half of the attractions closed and no characters.,Disneyland Paris was the biggest disappointment. It‚Äôs the second time we have been and compared to the first it was terrible this time. Firstly have the attractions in the park are closed and they don‚Äôt tell you when you book. None of the characters are available to take photos like before and no characters join for breakfast/lunch/dinner in any of the restaurants. To enjoy any of the restaurants you have to book 2 months in advance. It‚Äôs crazy. We were unable to book any restaurants even thought we had a full meal plan plus. It was hot dogs and burgers only. Today it was raining and they made the little kids wait in the rain when they could easily open up the queue to be undercover. When I asked them to the said due to COVID and can‚Äôt open it in a very rude way. The other rides have no social distancing in their lines and there it‚Äôs fine but here where u had little kids they made them wait in the rain. What an embarrassment to the Disney brand to do that to little kids. At the hotels it was also impossible to get a table for dinner. We managed to find a seat only at 10:30pm with a 4yr old. Overall the experience has been terrible and we will not return to Disneyland Paris. Don‚Äôt waste your time and money coming here. So many of the staff have been so rude during our stay. Maybe stick to the US park instead of coming here.,"Written September 27, 2021"

Last time it felt like the magic wasn't really there as the staff members weren't enthusiastic. This has improved a lot this time. There was no castle but this wasn't a problem and I think the scaffolding they have put over it is really good. We had good weather which was nice, not sure how well it would have faired in the rain as limited indoors places due to covid. The covid restrictions were really good and they were asking people to put masks over their noses which was good. Shame there were no fireworks though.","Written September 17, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,Disney Losing It's Magic,"Let's face it! Disney is expensive. It is a very popular IP and holds dear memories close to most of our hearts. But I question if it is starting to lose it's way?

I travelled with my six year old, three year old and my wife. This was done fairly last minute due to us having to cancel the USA version due to COVID. I now am considering not bothering with WDW Florida and staying at Universal instead when borders re-open. They have got rid of the free Fast pass and replaced with the Genie app that allows you to pay around ¬£15 per person per ride (depending on the ride) on top of what is nearly ¬£300 worth of tickets for a family of four for the day. On top of this four cheese toasties came in at around ¬£40. This is a lot of money!

I am ok with Disney being expensive when it is a company doing everything they can to give you the best most premium experience and escapism they can. The company that builds mountains for a rollercoaster or the world leader in animatronics in it's seeking to entertain. But everything new is just cheap, local theme park quality! Everything seems to be sold on the intellectual property rather than the experience. Take the pirate themed area. Big waterfalls, ships and rides that are world immersive. Compared to a few fibre glass statues and cheap MDF theming for the newer Toy Story area.

The Fast Pass is nothing more than another money grab! The park did not have too many people but the normal queues were massive. I question the conflict of interest brought up by the new Genie Fast Pass when it means it is in the interest of Disney to not have the normal lines move quickly as they make an uplift by charging people to skip the lines. On Thunder Mountain we were near the Fast Pass entry (whilst in the normal queue) and we were held up 20 minutes as they let continual streams of people who had paid extra onto the ride. Stuck in a queue with plastic walls on either side, merely inches wider than your shoulders! Trapped in a hot, sweaty claustrophobic hell hole is now the Disney experience set at the ¬£300 entry point. Why solve the queue issue when you can rip more money out of your guests pocket? They may argue other parks do this but, other parks are not built on the reputation of Disney memory making magic that is severely dirtied by this nor do they charge such premium charges for their experiences. The Ratatouille ride is an OK ride that puts you in front of a few different cinema screens and acts like a simulator. It is ok but it is no Disney! It is not pushing to immerse you or do something new. These systems can be found at other much cheaper parks such as Terra Mitica in Spain.

The cost of food for the quality is now a joke that you hear guests opening mocking in the lines.

Simply, Disney as a theme park experience is turning into an over priced proposition that is relaying on past reputations to get the guest. Seems to be far more about the merchandise and up charges than transporting you to another world. Where has the old Disney Imagineering gone? I miss it and willing to pay a premium price for it! For what you get now? Save your money and go to Europa Park in Germany!","Written September 13, 2021"

It would be completely unbearable at anything greater than 50% capacity.if you enjoy long queues aching feet expensive food then disneyland paris is the place for you. Luckily I only paid for 2 parks over 1 day. The 2nd park is small and could be easily contained in the main park. It's just a cynical way of disney to rip you off. As is typical with a lot of theme parks you pay a lot of money to enter. However to ensure you enjoy your day. You need to buy another ticket at a similar price so you can queue jump. Will not be going again. Would recommend that you attend asterix park about 30k away. Worst day of my holiday.,"Written September 6, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,A nice break,"After having 2 WDW trips cancelled, my husband and I thought we‚Äôd try here to get our Disney fix.

We spent 3 nights/4 days here and stayed in Newport Bay Club which gave us EMH (well worth having). Overall, we had a great break and really enjoyed ourselves. There are a couple of rides at DLP that we actually enjoyed more than Orlando, but on the whole it missed the magic for us. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs because we‚Äôve been lucky enough to go to Orlando 4 times over the last 8 years, or if it‚Äôs because of COVID, but we won‚Äôt be in a hurry to go back (although the expansion plans look cool so never say never!)

The cast members were definitely lacking though and the lack of places open for something to eat or drink just made the days harder work than they needed to be - I understand why so many people take picnics in now. We had 5 burgers in few days we were there - I never have burgers! There was literally sod all else to eat though.

Another issue was the other guests. No one abided by the social distancing markers, people were wearing their masks incorrectly all over, and staff seemed fed up with having to keep reminding people to wear them properly (understandable when they‚Äôre being so blatantly ignore).

I didn‚Äôt really like that there were plenty of characters viewing opportunities. It felt like if you wanted to see characters then that would be easy enough to do (from a distance). Queues for rides were longer than I normally enjoy though with the lack of fast pass (big tickets were usually around 45-60 mins long) but I can imagine not having to worry about FP is a draw to some families.

So yeah. We had a great time but I would really think about what you want from your break and what you can compromise on before booking as it‚Äôs not a cheap trip and it didn‚Äôt hit the mark for us.",

France,Disneyland Paris,"Awful, Bad, Sad.","Disneyland Paris

The worst Disney experience of our life.

We are disney junkies and we are lucky enough to have visited all the parks in the world with the exception of Shanghai.

I'm not going to start comparing park to park because they are really different from Anaheim to Florida, Tokyo, etc.

But what stands out at any Disney location (hotels, parks, waterparks, etc) is the service. We always get great service, people smile and treat you nicely and most of all they try to work with you if you have any problems to help you out.

This is not the case in Disneyland Paris. The people here treat you really badly.

First I made a reservation in June to pay 1050 euros for a cabin and park access. 7 days before our arrival they canceled my reservation. They told us to communicate with their phone line, after 7 tries with 50 minutes wait each time we give up. So we had to get a new reservation now costin 1390 euros. 255 euros extra for the same package we booked months before.

Contacting the disney france team on social media they told me to try at the hotel reception

After arriving at the hotel they told me they can't do anything because it is not their problem.... They gave us the cabin but told us we could get there 1 hour earlier (even though the cabin was free) , gave us the park tickets and we were on our way... we thought that was it but noooo.

Arriving at the park we got to the ticket entrance and of course the tickets didn't work. We had to go to customer service another hour until they realized they gave us the tickets from the cancel reservation instead of the new one.

Now it's 1 pm and we are finally into the park.

We arrived at the food center at Walt Disney Studios Park and we were happy to read in a sign ""food allergies ask for the special menu"" my sister is gluten intolerant.

We got to the order booth and they said...oh no no we only have salads and a dessert not hot food gluten free... nice job Disney....

As the day goes by we got back to the hotel happy to go to the pool, we got to the front desk to mention the issue we had with the new tickets and this was the conversation:

Me: Hi I wanted to change my tickets as they appear not to work
Disney Agent: Did you get to the park?
Me: Yes, but we have to wait 30 minutes for customer service to recognize the error and let us in.
Disney Agent: Then you got in so don't complain.....

And that was it.. no sorry for the trouble, it was a small error, nothing.

The next few days we just realized that the experience in Disney Paris is as different as it can be from the Disney in Florida or Anaheim so we try to enjoy as much as possible.

My takeaway is that we can mark down that we visited but we will never ever go back.

France,Disneyland Paris,Congested Studios,"3 years ago I wrote a very negative review particularly due to difficult online booking system. 3 years later during post Covid environment online booking became even more difficult. Not only you book and pay your tickets but also you need to confirm the day you are visiting with a separate process. Otherwise, you face great difficulty at the gates because they do not only check the QR codes but also they check the registration QR code.

Studios were particularly very congested since significant part of the Studios and activities were
closed. They claim that they are closed as part of Covid related measures but they even created further congestion since people are given no choice but to queue up with the remaining very limited activities which are open. The queue at the toilets of Studio 1 was unacceptable since nearby facilities were closed. There were more activities open at Magic Kingdom Park, therefore, it was relatively less congested.

Given the current circumstances I do not recommend to visit Studios. I am surprised that they can still charge the full price.","Written August 29, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,Great Time over Multiple Days,"Great Park - great Time with the kids. Stay at a Disney hotel and GET IN EARLY ... because the lines get long fast (especially on the weekends).

France,Disneyland Paris,"DISNEY HAS LOST IT's MAGIC ! Please, please, PLEASE read before booking!","A very disappointing and frustrating stay for the children. So many services have been suspended surrounding contradictory COVID regulations:

- There are no fireworks
- Parades have been suspended
- Photos with Disney characters have to be taken at a distance, complete with masks.
- Any child over the age of 6 have to wear masks at all times around the park.
- The Disney castle is under scaffolding.
- Many of the restaurants and rides are closed, making it near impossible to get a restaurant reservation, despite having purchased a meal plan.
- Too many rides got closed on the days we visited due to technical difficulties : RC Racer, Peter Pan, Hyper Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain. Deeply upsetting for children when you have waited in the queue for over an hour only to be told to come back later. Thats if they bother to tell you at all!
- Impossible to get standby passes - do they actually exist?
- Despite all of the wonderful things such as parades and fireworks being cancelled due to COVID, you are still sardined next to hundreds of people in queues for hours on end and prices remain sky high.

The whole experience left me and my children very sad and disappointed with a bad taste in my mouth. It was nothing like what we had experienced in Disney USA. My advice would be to save your hard earned money and either wait until normal services resume or save save save for Disneyland Florida, Disneyland Paris is currently all out of magic.","Written August 25, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,delightful park,"So we are seasoned veterans of Disney World (in Florida, USA). Our expectations were low because we had heard many negative things about the Paris park, from not being as 'magical' to the food being terrible. However, we had a blast. Yes, the park is smaller and not as 'magical' especially during Covid times, we found it to be pleasantly delightful. I might even be convinced enough to say that the rides, as a whole, are better, and definitely longer, in DLP. I have no plans on returning (as we live in America) however I have no hesitation to recommend the park to another park goer.","Written August 22, 2021"

France,Disneyland Paris,Disappointed in MGM Studios and magic kingdom,"Inform customers before entry that most of the attractions, shows and parades are closed, at least then customers can make the decision to enter, rather than be disappointed, especially in MGM studios.

Our grandson is autistic & ADHD and cannot wait in a queue, most of the attractions that were open didn‚Äôt have capacity for people with handicap green cards. We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly, they deserve a medal as many people are very dissatisfied.

Even the castle is not visible, it is masked up with temporary coverings. Which really effects the feel and excitement for the grandchildren.

Appreciate we are still in the midst of COVID, but still, people want the best experience, and I‚Äôm afraid to say that this was absent in both parks.

With Sars-NCOV-19 they closed all fountains in the park. Also, the bathroom water is at 35 degrees so you can only wash your hands... They want you to buy water bottles at a price of 3'30‚Ç¨ the 500ml ones.

This is a bit degrading to people. They could already give a couple of bottles at the entrance, because the tickets are so expensive, or indicate it explicitly before entering the parks so that people are aware of the problem that exists with water.

Also, there isn't any shadow place. People was searching it like ants under a magnifying glass... They were invading gardens and places that are supposed to not be used.

France,Disneyland Paris,Know before you go!,"Our experience of Disneyland Paris in August 2021 was really disappointing for our family for the following reasons:

1. Many of the rides and parades were closed, without notice on the website when booking our tickets, apparently due to COVID. Even the famous castle is shrouded in scaffolding and cladding. If we had known in advance, we would not have paid 360 euros for a family of 5 including 2 children who just turned 12 and are now counted as adults. This is strange when the accepted definition of most adults is either aged 16 or 18.

2. One of the adults was a disabled senior but she still had to pay the full adult tariff even though she could only access ONE ride the entire day - the river boat. In fact she was charged 225 euros to rent a wheelchair for the day - no other venues we visited in Paris this week charged a fee and deposit in this way for disabled travelers. This on top of a 30 euro parking fee!

3. There were too few benches to sit and relax in between the 45 minute wait times for rides.

4. The restaurants and shops are all vastly over-priced but this is to be expected.

Overall I would not recommend the park for anyone other than with children between the ages of 5-9. Certainly not for seniors, people with disabilities and older children.

Lastly Disney should be transparent about their pricing in relation to the current restrictions so that consumers can make an informed decision and not end up disappointed as we are.","Written August 6, 2021"

Planet Hollywood has happy hour between 5-7 i believe and if you have one drink there you get a free portion of large nachos - enough for a family of 4!! Take your own water bottles in and fill up in the park as the drinks are expensive, but if you do this, you'll enjoy your day so much more!

The park is packed, i don't understand why you have to register to visit, as there is no limit to visitors, we registered the day before. For each ride we had to wait for 1 - 1,5 hours, even for a regular caroussel. We didn't even try Peter Pan, the wait seemed 2 hours there. You have to wait in endless lines for everything, food included. The attractions seemed a bit boring. There are A LOT of shops, camouflaged as attractions or fun, many more than attractions themselves. In the shops there is almost nothing that costs less than 16 euros.

We last went in July 2020. We, like many, had been on lockdown for months, so it was a welcome break away. I had lost my mother soon before due to covid and needed some time with the children away to distract me, this was the choice we had and glad we did..I had never seen the park so empty in my life..no queues for the attractions ( absolutely wonderful ) for a change..everything was in place for the situation at the time , all in all a very good experience..We went the first two days of reopening ( after annual pass holders) very quiet as the Disney hotels were not open at the time and many tourists were just not travelling to France. Such a better time we had than when my daughter went with her French exchange family some months before ( just before covid) and spent a fortune for the day ( family live in Lille) to only go on two rides !! we were not best pleased..too many people allowed in, during normal circumstances..so make the most of the time that Disney limit the amount of people going in..how ever long that will last..have fun :)","Written July 11, 2021"

There are a lot great attractions for all the ages, nice live concerts, beloved heroes, lot of shops and cafes. Love everything except the queues: everywhere, during all the day. What I recommend you how to use your time. There are the fast tracks nearby all the attractions. There you can take your free ticket without any queue. This fast track ticket gives you your turn after about 1-2 hours and on the defined period of time. It is very easy and comfortable to plan your time in the Disneyland. And the main idea - no queues. Unfortunately we understood the system about queues too late and use just 2 fast tracks such way. So sometime we stayed about 1 hour in the queue! Can you imagine?:) Also I would advise you to start the visit early in the morning, at the opening hours, about 11 I think. Also the bonus for the people who stayed at the Disneyland hotel is to begin the attractions a few hours before the official opening.

We were there till the end, till 23 pm. At the final of the day there was absolutely fantastic salute! Also, fewer people were starting from 6-7 pm. So take my advices and use your time effectively!","Written June 30, 2021"

If you decide to come here, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. From the rides, shows, parades‚Ä¶ literally everything will put a smile on your face. Even just sitting at the park would be a lovely way to spend your time.

It‚Äôs not just about the shows or rides, it‚Äôs also impossible to not notice how pretty the castle is. It‚Äôs perhaps the most beautiful of the Disney parks. The Park is fantastic for young kids and the Studio's for older kids. It‚Äôs just that wherever you go, there‚Äôs a long-ass line, which consumes a lot of time. Well, the good thing is that there are FASTPASS tickets which I used repeatedly for the Space Mountain Rollercoaster.

As for the entertainers, I have nothing but praise for them for filling the place with magic. I loved seeing every bit of their performances.

Everything is pretty expensive though ‚Äì from the tickets, food, and merchandise. Still, I will come back once the pandemic is over!

This review is soooo late but I remember nearly everything so I guess it's fine.",
France,Disneyland Paris,disney land paris,"went as a school trip many years ago. We had fun on all the rides, the waiting lines are very long but that;s to be expected. The souvenirs were super expensive but that;s also to be expected by a company like Disney",
France,Disneyland Paris,Magic ruined by poor New Year's party organisation,"Ignore the date given for my visit - it was actually over 2019/20 New Year but the field doesn't allow me to go back that far.

It was my wife's 60th birthday on New Year's Eve 2019. Having been to Disneyworld Florida a few years ago, she wanted to go to Disneyland Paris for her birthday, so I booked a visit for us and our two teenage sons. When booking I included a ticket for Disney's New Year's Eve party so that we could be in the park that evening and watch the fireworks display to see in the New Year.

The parks, of course, were great. Disney is very good at theme parks. Good rides and generally well organised. That part we really enjoyed. The weather wasn't as good as Florida but I can't blame Disney for that!

The accommodation (Sequoia Lodge) was ok. The reception and dining areas were great and breakfast was good. The accommodation blocks were comfortable enough, but the decor was looking a bit tired.

The New Year's Eve party was a huge disappointment. We had assumed, from the way these tickets were sold, that the park would close and be cleared before re-opening for the evening. Unless they did that in the 45 minutes we stepped outside to get some food, that didn't happen. When we re-entered the park, there was a checkpoint set up on one of the routes in to ensure that people were wearing the wristband showing they had purchased New Year's Eve tickets, but it was easy to avoid this by using one of the other routes into the park. As we wandered around the park that evening, we saw many people who did not appear to have the wristband. There was no effort to prevent them going on rides, check that they had valid tickets for the party or remove them. The park was very full.

As midnight approached, we tried to make our way to the Central Plaza to watch the fireworks. It rapidly became clear that there were far too many people in the park. We found ourselves squashed like sardines in the middle of a crowd with no ability to move in any direction. In my opinion it was unsafe.

When the fireworks started, I could see some of the display but much of it was hidden by buildings or people holding their smartphones over their heads to film the fireworks. My oldest son, who is a little taller than me, saw a bit more but not much. My wife and younger son saw absolutely nothing. Remember, this was supposed to be my wife's birthday treat. She could hear the fireworks but didn't see a single one.

I came away from the evening feeling we had been scammed by DIsney - persuaded to pay extra for an event unnecessarily, and then being unable to see the main event. As far as I am concerned, the New Year's Eve Party tickets were a complete waste of money. We could have got into the park without them and they didn't entitle us to anything extra when we were in. To say we were disappointed is putting it mildly. The only reason I haven't demanded a refund is that my wife enjoyed the rest of the visit and feels that pursuing Disney on this would spoil the memories of the good bit of the trip.

If you can afford to go to Florida, go to Disneyworld. It is much better. If not, I would recommend Disneyland Paris, but don't be conned into paying extra for a New Year's Eve party or similar.","Written March 16, 2021"

If I cancel now I will lose 15% of the booking and 100% of flights as flights with Air France are non refundable.

The Disney agents I spoke to in the US were no help one advising that I should wait and see if Air France cancel the flights closer to the time, but to do this I would have to pay my full balance on the 8/2 and risk losing more of my money if the fights are not cancelled by the airline.

France,Disneyland Paris,Lactose intolerant? Vegan? Curb your expectations.,"I am pretty shocked that there is absolutely NO consideration (or any options) for people with 'special' diets (feel the sarcasm). I meen, not even one of the cafees or diners we've been to offers a measly vegetable based milk option, let alone food other than popcorn that a vegan could eat. That is not acceptable.

We were there during Pride month, the whole park had rainbow themes, yet all this inclusivity does not seem to include the rough average 6% of visitors, who do not want animals on their plates. And I have not even started on the sheer number of people who are simply lactose intolerant without being vegan. Say, about 85% of people of African descent e.g.

Thanks Disney. I feel cheeted and disappointed. The rides and settings are fun, but I am really sad that for a vegan the best meal around is a plate of oily fries and perhaps a tasteless salad, if you are lucky enough to find a restaurant that has them. Don't even think of getting a proper cappuccino either.","Written January 8, 2021"
France,Disneyland Paris,Enjoy yourself,"While it doesn't compare to Disney world, it is an incredible park. You have two options when to go:
The first one would be while there are many people; it seems as though it is part of the excitement to wait in line for 2 hours for each attraction.
The second option would be to go on a day that people are working and most of the park is empty.
Both of these options are good. If you want to go through the entire park in a minimum of time, I would advise you to go when no one is around; you can sometimes even stay at the attraction instead of going all around to do it again. AVOID WEDNESDAYS!!!

What a shame because it is really the children's dream but you have to pay the big money for it.
I wonder how people can afford even only a one day pass that is the cheapest rate to access, and forget the stay at the Disneyland hotel where a 2 nights stay will cost you more than $2,000, half the price of one week luxury cruise!
For instance 2 adults plus 1 kid pay already 260 euros, plus the parking + (hard to find because lack of signs) at 45 euros then you need a trolley for the kid add 25 euros, of course you do not want to starve the kids and again it over 35 euros for hot dog junk food fries and soda, total is already 365 euros before you pass by the goodies shops, add a few more bucks you are over 400 euros just for 1 day, 2 it's a small world tours, 1 Dumbo merry go round, 1 Lancelot merry go round, 1 circular railways and 1 labyrinth.

On the Saturday it did get a lot busier, but we had planned that day to do shopping so all in all, we didn't spend more than 10 minutes in any queue for the whole trip.

Brilliant trip!","Written October 20, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Dangerous ride ruined our trip,"The newish Pirates of the Caribbean ride...

No height restriction. No warning signs. Even asked a staff member on the way in if it was ok for young childen AND a 6 month old baby...

Told yes - that it was a ‚Äúvisual experience‚Äù

and it was...BUT with TWO HUGE PLUMMETS - boat type ride through water, lots of decoration and then the mentioned two drops - in the dark might I add.

I have never been more terrified in my life. I clung to our baby with one arm and the boat with the other.

Two 5 year olds crying plus a screaming baby. None of them CLEARLY old enough or tall enough for this ride.

Shocking.

The teenage ride operator laughed. Disney sent a french manger with very little English to take our complaint. On return their argument is they‚Äôve met the European safety requirements.

How I do not know. Similar rides @ Legoland and Chessington in the U.K. have height restrictions.

France,Disneyland Paris,Amazing place,"I rather enjoyed Disneyland Paris. It was a very colourful attraction, i think it would attract young viewers and disney fans. all your favourite Disney characters in one place. you can visit the castle, watch small shows. i really enjoyed it and my younger sister i would defiantly recommend this to Disney fans and parents of young aged children.

France,Disneyland Paris,Disneyland refusing to refund tickets that were sold as refundable.,"I really wasn't expecting such scamming behaviour from Disneyland Paris. They are refusing to refund tickets that were advertised and sold as refundable.

We bought tickets in July from the official website. At the time they were advertising that everything is flexible, refundable in case you are unable to travel, etc. The only 1-day ticket option at the time of purchase was a ticket that gave you a 6 month window and you need to reserve your day (explained as a measure to manage the number of people in the park). We did everything as instructed, but closer to travel date new lockdown measures came into place and we are now unable to travel.

So I got in touch with Disneyland to get a refund and they told me that - because it is not a ""dated"" ticket it is non-refundable (it was the only ticket option at the time)! I went to the official website and they have changed everything there now - the type of ticket that we bought in July is no longer available, there is no T&C that I can find that at the time stated that the ticket is refundable. The ticket code doesn't even work when I enter it into ""Manage My Booking"" section. Moreover, taking a closer look at the ticket pdf there is a very small fine print that says - ticket is non-refundable!

The website and T&Cs at the time of purchase made me believe that the ticket is refundable, but Disneyland is refusing to refund and I can't even prove any more than they were sold to me as refundable.

This is really a false advertising and scammy behaviour that I was not expecting from Disneyland Paris. I am really upset about this ‚Äì not only I didn‚Äôt get to travel to the park for my birthday but I also got scammed out of my money.

In case you bought tickets during Summer 2020 and now want to get a refund ‚Äì Disneyland will refuse, and you will not be even able to prove anything. Now I will be taking screenshots of everything when booking tickets such as these.","Written October 5, 2020"

There are fantastic attractions, shows and entertainment for all ages in enchanting surroundings. We found the queues to be manageable and the free fast-pass system and extra magic hours were a real bonus. 1.5 days was plenty of time to experience everything we wanted to. We especially enjoyed the spectacular fireworks in the evening, the perfect way to finish an magical day!

Because of the situation, fortunately for us, there were no queues and waiting hours for the games!
We had a ticket-package with hotel accommodation and entrance to both parks and we really enjoyed it! We spend there two whole days and we had the chance to do all the games! The place is magical and the heroes of Disney are fantastic!!

We went on a Thursday, so it was quiet. The plexiglas and the stickers on the floor make sure everyone keeps a distance, but it doesn't ruin the atmosphere of the park. Some rides were closed, but nothing important (to us). We could meet various Disney characters and make pictures with them. You have to keep a distance from the characters, but it didn't bother me. You have to wear a mask all time, but that is how it is now. The only thing we missed was a map of the park. If you have an old one at home, bring it! All in all I had a perfect birthday!",

France,Disneyland Paris,A Unique Experience,"It was a sunny cold day in January with all the new year decoration in Disneyland, Paris, like a dream. I walked through all my loved animations from childhood, and even made photos with their main characters, but the unique experience was in Gustavo restaurant when I was in the movie and made Ratatouille with Remi.
I can never forge the day.",
France,Disneyland Paris,Profit over people! A COVID's dream,"Very disappointing experience for our family of 6 - apparent COVID guidelines are not working and frankly not good enough.
COVID concerns:
- Markers on the ground for people to stand, however, these are not big enough for families to stand together and many people ignoring them completely - staff need to enforce this.
- Reduced numbers of people in the parks... I don't think so! Busier than I have ever seen it before.
- Big Thunder Mountain - the line for this was very enclosed and packed in. People were so close to me that I felt someone breathing on my back. Plastic and wooden panels around felt very very claustrophobic and uncomfortable. Perfect place for COVID to spread with very little air circulation. I wanted to turn back and leave the line but it is impossible to get out without getting close to other people waiting. This would also be very dangerous if there was a fire - I dread to think!
- Restaurants were not clean and tables were not being cleaned after each use. Yet if you have an allergy to hand sanitiser you are not even allowed to enter buildings... very discriminative

Poor value for money:
- The park hours are reduced yet ticket prices remain the same.
- Waited in long queues several times to be told there was a 'technical fault'
- The Princess Pavillion does not have any princesses.. they have put a troll in place instead lol ... I guess COVID is a good excused to pay less staff. 2 very disappointed girls as we were not aware of this when booking ticket.
- Stopping the fireworks is just another way to cut costs and increase profit - there really is no reason not to have them. If the excuse for this is 'it encourages people to gather' ... well everyone enters the park at the same time and leaves at the same time resulting in large amounts of people trying to leave at the same time in large number.
- Many restaurants are not yet open.

To conclude... if you are thinking of going I would wait until the pandemic is over as exposure to the virus is high risk here. Definitely feels very profit orientated which I find very sad when children are involved. However, Disney do not care as they know they have guaranteed custom but our family definitely won't return and will encourage others considering not to either unless the park can up their game and make health a priority!","Written September 1, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Didn't feel safe!,"The park was so busy that it was impossible to socially distance due to long queues. I could see no evidence of restricted numbers of people. There are boxes painted on the floor where you should not stand but most people just ignore them and there is no enforcement of the rules. The space where you can stand is too small for a large family.
The worst by far was the Big Thunder Mountain Ride - there are plastic boards all around the queue which causes poor ventilation. The plastic is dirty with kids touching and even licking them. Did anyone ever think of fire safety? If there was a fire people are so packed in and the walk is so long if anything happened the people would be trapped in by the plastic boards!!! Very clostraphobic! Very difficult to get out if you need to.
But yet you cannot take your mask off for an open air photo with the Disney Photographer where there is no chance of anyone standing beside you (it is cordoned off) and the photographer is far away! Good ventilation - no risk there - so really the rules do not make sense!
Plus reduced services - why no fireworks? This is open air and good ventilation and not a line where you must stand next to other people.
Reduced services and reduced opening times does not improve COVID safety - the price of tickets don't reduce though!
An uncomfortable experience with young kids.","Written September 1, 2020"

France,Disneyland Paris,Fantastic trip despite Covid,"We just visited for 4 days and had an amazing time. There were lots of hand held stations, at the entrance of every ride queue, throughout and just before the ride. We had to wear masks at all times (unless eating/drinking) and staff were quick to remind visitors who had moved their mask down. There were reminders on the floor to keep a distance and this was great in the queues as no one was pushing behind you (which we have experienced previously). Because of reduced visitors the queues were very minimal (in the height of summer/ school holidays) so we managed to get on lots of rides. The Lion King theatre show in Frontierland theatre was amazing - You book via Lineberty App. The character meet and greets were obviously different and were more a selfie opportunity but the queues for these were short which was great. There was unfortunately no firework show but understandable because of the situation. There were random mini parades a few times which were fun. We had a great time and look forward to going again when it‚Äôs all back to normal and we can have the full experience again.","Written August 25, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Disappointed at times,"We visited Disneyland a couple of weeks ago and I'm glad we went to a degree. We had paid full price via online ticket purchasing but when in the park quite a few big rides were no working due to the virus and a technical fault. Although the rides we went on were good I just felt that maybe the tickets should maybe have a discount on them due to the fact not all the rides were available. Staff are great, organisation of the park was really safe just a let down that some of the rides we wanted to go in weren't on.","Written August 25, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Almost perfect considering,"We took the chance and went over knowing that we‚Äôd be in quarantine on our return. It was 100% worth it (may not feel exactly the same after the next 2 weeks). We have 3 children; 3, 5 & 7 and they all loved it! I don‚Äôt need to write about why the liked it, it‚Äôll be the same for every child, a mix of the ‚ÄúDisney‚Äù magic, the rides and the gener atmosphere.
But, in this COVID era, what‚Äôs it like? Never been in summer before, but I bet it was much, much busier than this. Maximum queue was 40mins and most were 20-30 mins any time of day. We were staying in a Disney hotel so we took advantage of the ‚ÄúMagic Hour‚Äù and got several goes on most of the big rides.
There are hand sanitiser machines all over the place, including just before you get on every ride and just after. The staff ask everyone to clean before they get on, so they don‚Äôt have to wipe down every surface of every ride and thus take twice as long. There are more machines dotted around the park and even in the queues.
There are also signs in every queue advising people to not stand there and maintain distance. Unfortunately, it seems maybe the more local visitors (I‚Äôm guessing this as they were generally speaking French) struggled with this, took a couple of pictures of people just standing on them. Why!? If the whole country was this poor at social distancing, it doesn‚Äôt bode well for reducing their currently high community transmission rate!!!
The magic, the rides, everything else was great. If you‚Äôre in the UK and can accept the 2 week quarantine after - go. It‚Äôs worth it!",
France,Disneyland Paris,Magical birthday treat for our son,"Positively they took COVID seriously with face masks and sanitizer.
The queues were shorter than usual and most rides in the main park were open.
However, the studios was very disappointing. There were no shows on except Stitch and no parades. Although I accept some shows could not operate, the outdoor one certainly could have. If you can put the lion king on then you could have done better in the studios.
Or you could have reduced the price. Or made all tickets park hopper. There wasn‚Äôt enough to do in the studios to fill the day and there wasn‚Äôt any thought into making magic in other ways. Distanced photo opportunities were also limited. Felt cheated by this park.

France,Disneyland Paris,"Social distanced fun, still magical, staff very friendly in hard times.","We arrived on the Eurostar on the afternoon of day 1 so spent a few hours in the Studios and the second full day in the park. There have been some big changes for the Covid measures. Everyone wears a face mask, regardless of who you are or exemptions, so it was good and enforced. There was social distancing in the queues with floor markers and enhanced barriers. There were a higher number of attractions or restaurants, food stalls etc closed - mainly because of the lower numbers in the park. It was very hot (32-35C) and all the water fountains were closed because of covid, but there were plenty of places to buy water- would have been good if you could get these refilled by staff. There were opportunities to have selfies or pictures with the characters even in the heat, but you couldn't get close to them or get autographs.

France,Disneyland Paris,A Tale of Two Visits.... Very Different Experiences,"As a frequent visitor to DLRP, with my first visit in May 1992, we've continued to visit over the years.

Having bought Infinity Annual Passes last summer, and Covid19, we did wonder whether or not we'd ever get to use the passes again.

What smiles we had on our faces when we first entered Disneyland Paris once more in late July. We'd booked our day online, and we entered to a near empty park.

Even in the winter months of the 90's I'd never seen it so empty.

It was an utter delight to not to have to queue for rides or food. We knew that DLRP were putting a cap on visitor numbers, and we couldn't have been happier.

As a family who'd not eaten out since February 2020, we were a little apprehensive about eating in the park restaurants, but because they were so empty, and with our own hand gel, it felt fine.

We had a great day, we really did.

That said three weeks later, we returned on our way back to the UK. The park was much much busier. Perhaps they'd increased numbers allowed into the park, or perhaps it was because it was now August? Either way there were elements of our experience that didn't feel safe to us.

A particular instance, was the Ratatouille ride. It was a pretty long wait, but we stood in the queuing system. As we reached the entrance to the building, it was pretty much just our family that used the alcoholic gel on the wall. After getting out of the ride vehicle, there was no cleaning at all before the next riders got in.

Then when it came to food, again in the Cafe de Hyperion, we sat at a table that we presumed to have been recently cleaned, but it soon became evident that cleaning in there was almost none existent.

I saw multiple people leave tables, and then because it was so busy, other diners immediately sitting down at uncleaned tables.

There was a large man with cleaning materials, but he was on one level, and didn't move up or down a level to clean anything whilst we sat eating. Our kids take an age to eat anything, so in my nosiness, I sat watching a total lack of cleaning.

I'm going to say this, the week previous we'd spent time on site at Portaventura. Then cleaning there was incredibly, you genuinely couldn't do more as a theme park company.

Everytime diners left a table, immediately, and I mean immediately, cleaning teams came across, removed everything, and cleaned tables, chairs, everything. I watched in so many different areas, the theme parks, the hotels, restaurants, the most thorough of cleans.

I saw little cleaning at DLRP, the contrast was incredibly stark.

Right now we're in self quarantine because the UK government changed the rules whilst we were in Spain. The crazy thing is, is that there's probably a greater chance of us contracting Covid19 in France.

As a huge Disney fan... frankly we should've been in WDW during our holiday, but that went pear shaped because of the US flight ban, I've always had a lot of positive things to say about DLRP, but they just were not doing enough in my opinion.

Surely after each time we scanned our passes on the turnstiles, they should've been cleaned? The perspex on them is so scratched on the laser readers, that you have to rub your pass on the reader... and I never saw them cleaned.

Handrails in queuing areas... never saw them being cleaned.

All in all, both my Wife and I were very disappointed with the level of cleaning we saw firsthand.

Our passes have been extended up to January 2021 owing to the park shut down. Do I think we'll be using them again before they expire? No, most probably not. In these Covid19 times, I'd return to Portaventura in a shot, because you couldn't go a few minutes without seeing teams of people cleaning.

It was a great shame to see that despite efforts to make queues safer, and yes no one can deny what they've done, but putting alcohol gel up on rides, and then no one using it makes a total mockery. Thorough cleaning is essential at this time.

As a demonstration, in Portaventura, the staff made sure you applied gel. Then on rides where you touched surfaces, they made you wear provided disposable gloves. Overall they just seemed do everything better.

Anyway I'll leave it there... if you're going to have a very busy park, full of people from all over Europe, there's no excuses for poor hygiene standards.

France,Disneyland Paris,Post Covid closure trip,"Being an Annual Pass holder I was so pleased when Disneyland Paris reopened. That I couldn‚Äôt wait to go back

And Inwas not disappointed. Lots of hand sanitiser stations throughout the parks and village , before you board a ride you are encouraged to use them. Masks are mandatory for everyone over the age of 11. If a cast member sees you without a mask on they ask you politely to put it on

Character m&g are now selfie spots these work realy well and you can have some
Fun with the characters even from a distance

There are now shows or parades at the moment but they have added the. Characters in the shows to the selfie opportunity so bows a great time to meet some of those rarer characters. The reduced capacity means social distancing is not an issue and you can do many attractions

France,Disneyland Paris,Some of the magic but not all!,"We visited the park as a desperate attempt to salvage some holiday this year.
Firstly if you‚Äôre registering to come to the park, the barcodes from the registration are not the ones you need to get in you still need your ticket too!
We only received two tickets via email as we booked with magic breaks not directly with Disney.
We had a child ticket which I had purchased separately and not printed off.....therefore I had to visit guest services to get it printed!
With a 5 year old in the baking heat in a queue with only one person serving not good!
You‚Äôre not treated like a customer in these situations with Disney. You have to prove everything and it‚Äôs an insult.
You would not have a registration barcode without a ticket????
Anyhow rant over because I felt very annoyed with it and it wasn‚Äôt magical waiting in an impossible queue.

We got into the park lots of kiosks closed and I‚Äôm glad for once we didn‚Äôt stay with a Disney hotel as the package would have been a waste of money on this occasion.
We didn‚Äôt need a photo pass as you wear a mask constantly even on rides, so no photos will show any expression. Characters are at a distance so no cuddles or photos with Disney photographers.
We only wanted one day in the park so luckily with Magic Breaks we could just do this and not pay for one night in a hotel and two days in a park.
It was mega hot and shade was limited but the queuing wasn‚Äôt too bad. No more than 35-40 mins at the most. A couple of the main rides had an hour plus but we didn‚Äôt bother with those.
The queues were spaced out and in the heat this was a bonus.
There are no water fountains turned on around the park so buying expensive bottles of water was a need. It would have been nice for Disney to do something here.
With a lack of live shows and being unable to cuddle the characters at least give back something to the crowds whom have committed to Disney to visit regardless of COVID.

The restaurants outside the park are very expensive but is expected! The bakery/sweet shop on Main Street has some lovely treats like chocolate covered mickey shaped marshmallows and mickey shaped cookies!

we walked the parks in the afternoon and did not see any characters then we queued over an hour to see Mickey and Belle in a theatre for 2 mins

Avoid!! I understand during Co-Vid changes have to be made. But all precautions are just an excuse to charge you the same and cut the parades, meet the princess, the fireworks, closed attractions. You can get sick in the way out of every attraction (is control in the way in, but 0 in the way out) so this cuts are nonsense. Charge less or keep it close

There were no park maps due to covid which we appreciate however the app was next to useless for finding your way round and signage in the main park was terrible.
We visited the village the afternoon with high expectations but again nothing was open outside the main Disney store and 2 burger joints which at 62 euros for 2 x burger and drink is more than our evening meals have costed in restaurants!!

Perhaps I‚Äôm spoilt due to having been to Florida sooo many times. I had high expectations but was sadly disappointed we won‚Äôt return.",
France,Disneyland Paris,"Magic of Disney, Left Frozen,","Disneyland never disappoints. The park is clean, the food is good, the rides and attractions are always fun for the whole. Family. We visited as a family of four. Two adults, a child of 9 and a child of 4. The rides were fun for all, and a good mixture. The queuing is horrendous though. A lot of which is done outside which needs to be addressed. Great in summer, really not great in February. It was COLD.

Transport too and from the park is good, and the surrounding area is also a nice experience.",

France,Disneyland Paris,Not much magic,"Didn't know what to expect due to current situation. I read a previous review, the description 'over priced theme park' is a true reflection. if you want to ride without massive queues you are going to love it, we manage 5 x thunder mountain, 4 x space mountain and all the rest. Disappointed that Buzz light year ride was off.
Unfortunately most of the 'magic' was missing, no parades ,shows or character activity, the things required to make it a different experience from normal parks.
my feeling is that they have opened to early and don't have the staff to provide the usual unique experience. Face masks compulsory in all areas. If your mask should shift off your face on a ride your post ride photo will not be displayed.
Kids loved it by the way so maybe I should have got them to write this.","Written July 27, 2020"

Pros: fantastic ambiance, landscaping and magical rides. Queues (even with Covid-19 measures) acceptable. We particularly loved peter pan, pirates of the carribean, swiss family robinson treehouse and thunder mountain.

Cons: food, food, food - no healthy options, ‚Ç¨50 for an adult‚Äôs menu which is extremely basic. All smaller restaurants serve pre-made microwaved food for around ‚Ç¨15 per person.

France,Disneyland Paris,Don‚Äôt bother during Covid,"We have been a few times before with our older children but this was our toddlers first visit, we just did one day as the older children have been before and we stayed at nearby centre parcs.
We knew there would be adjustments for Covid as this is the world we now live in but the day was rubbish and the price did not reflect the experience - with reduced services they should reduce the price, family of four and a toddler it was ¬£350 for the 2 parks for the day and roughly ¬£29 (30e) to Park.
Face masks are compulsory all round the park including the rides and in the open air.. i understand inside but outside is too much and my 14year old really struggled as it was a scorching hot day, at times she could not breath and momentarily pulled her mask down in open air to breath and was aggressively shouted at by staff. I drank water and was shouted at again.
There are no parades and shows - they had four months to work on something that could fit social distancing rules. Other than selfie spots it really is just a Very expensive theme park at the moment and not a magical experience. I know we are in a pandemic but with the money Disney rake in theY could have done more or slashed prices","Written July 24, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,"Great park, rip off food and drinks","The park was excellent and all the rides were amazing, however I think it's unfair that they are selling their food and drinks at extortionate prices. A bottle of Fanta was 3.65 and there are no cheaper options, considering alot of family's save up to take their children and have already paid alot to come to the park, I think it's really unfair. There is pricey and then there's just ridiculous. A burger drink and desert in the pirates restaurant was 41.00. That said the rides were definately worth it and the Disney app shows you waiting times throughout the park.",
France,Disneyland Paris,Shamefull service,"Reservation system is down and utterly broken, unable to make a reservation. Tried to contact them trough Facebook where they are ignoring the problem.

Around 35 min from Paris by train, RER A to Marne-la-Vall√©e/Chessy.

France,Disneyland Paris,how much time?,"if you have only a day to go, you would go in the middle of the week on a Tuesday or a Thursday (Wednesday are usually an off day for kids in France). there will be fewer people and it will be easier to do most of the attractions either you are alone or with family/ friends. If there are too many people, it would be better to get the pass so you don't have to wait in line for 2 hours every single time.
if you have more than a day to visit it, enjoy every moment. there many shows that are worth to watch and both parks are great to do.","Written June 25, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Good but not great,"I went with family and members of all age groups, right from 1 year old to 60 yrs old. The park is definitely a heaven on earth for kids, but I am sure it can be managed in a better way. I've visited an Universal Park before and by far it was much better organized. However I would strongly suggest that if you are with family don't go for the 1 day pass and try to cover both the parks, because it will be next to impossible, if there is a long wait time. I started with Walt Disney park and was able to do just 3-4 rides by afternoon and then rushed to Disney Park, where again it took almost 90 mins waiting for one ride.

If the place is crowded and it is sunny, you are in for a mess, because you don't get any place inside the restaurant to eat or relax. The waiting time is so high that you tend to skip the ride, so that you can see the park.

I strongly recommend to visit the place but either the duration should be longer or you should have the fast pass, to skip the line.","Written June 21, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,"Great Park, great friendly service","Beautifull Park, well maintained. Really great staff, very friendly and service orientated. The Park had a low occupancy (Covid related) and therefore no waiting times. this was a huge advantage. Some of the F&B outlets were closed, which I understand. I woul have given a 5 star rating if not for:
-- the high prices
-- the lack of rides and attractions for older kids.
-- there are still so many things in French (the haunted House story for instance).","Written June 21, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Unforgettable,"We went to Disneyland Paris for only one day but the experiences were just remarkable and unforgettable for me and my family. We went to different theme parks before but Disney in Paris was the best! There was an exciting, joyful, magical, and happy atmosphere from the moment we stepped in until the moment we leave the park.
We notice Christmas and New Year will be the busiest and crowdest time of the year so we chose to visit in February and got there very soon, so it was much less crowded. Although of course, we had to queue for our rides and turns, it was very much worth our time. And oh, we realized most theme parks are less clean when they are full of visitors, for example, we don't like seeing people throw tissues or leftover food into grass and flowers, it affects the environment and also the behaviors of other guests. Luckily we came at this time so it was fine, and there was always cleaning staff walk around to clean the areas.
My young sister said she loves the fact that wherever we went in the park, there was always her favorite Disney music, with beautiful decorations and colorful castles welcomed us. There was plenty of things to do and I guess we managed to play almost every most featured one, my favorite one was the Pirates of Caribbean sail while my little sis preferred the Peter Pan's flight. Overall we like all of it and my parents are happy with it too.","Written June 16, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Review for the plus size,"I visited jan 2020.
I want to do this review for any plus size people worried about there trip to Disneyland Paris, when I was going I spent months reading online worried I would be to big for any rides.
So I am plus size I wear a size 22/24 depending on the shop. I have a big chest. I went on every ride except - buzz light year laser blast (closed for refurb) Rock an roller coaster (also closed) the 2 rides I missed out of reading other reviews was Indiana Jones and Rc racer- this this ride has bigger seats but I didn‚Äôt want to risk the embarrassment. My husband went on with the kids and said a guy who wasn‚Äôt that big had to move to the bigger seat.
So stars wars space mountain - amazing ride over head harness and i fitted fine.
Star Wars 3d - seat belt strap very long no problems
Dumbo - long strap
Peter Pan- bar - just stops at you
Aladdin bar - just stops at you
Thunder mountain, really big seat could fit 3 people in - bar stops at you
Slinky - huge seat all 4 of us fitted -bar stops at you)
Crush coaster- I read reviews so was really worried the first time I didn‚Äôt bother getting in the que, I was guttered 2nd time I thought right I‚Äôm gonna try I will prob have to do the walk of shame but ile have to. I was so happy, the pull down bar which is also what you hold on to stopped at me. I wasn‚Äôt squashed at all, I can see you having more problems if your tall due to leg space - amazing ride
Toy soldiers parachutes - again seat belt strap, an then bar no problem
Tower of terror - long seat belt strap amazing ride
Phantom manor - wide seat bar come down
Pirates of the Caribbean - step in to boat wide seat fit the 4 of us on - no bar.
We had the best time, I don‚Äôt no why I was worried. I will definitely go back and no I will have nothing to worry about, it was so magical,
Clothes wise I don‚Äôt think I could of bought a top or jumper it was just sizes small to xl. And also people mention the bars you push round to get in the ride, ok I have to go side ways thru these bit I do in the uk so I wouldn‚Äôt really try to do it different, we done so many steps a day. One day I done 26000 so be prepared.",
France,Disneyland Paris,Needs some love. But childhood and family memories bring back,"A very expensive, duller version of wdw. I know we shouldnt compare but it is almost impossible to. It is so much smaller, so many people crammed in and a bit of a free for all at times to manage any form of positive memories for the family.

You run to get to the princess pavilion in the morning so dont queue long. You queue and tussle with others at the spontaneous meets and greets as there is never an organised line and the CMs try their best but everyone thinks they deserve to be the one chosen. Parades - you have to turn up minimum 20 minutes before start to get to the front and see everything. The fireworks show is a grower though. I didn't enjoy it at first but its grown. Needs more seating around though.","Written June 4, 2020"

France,Disneyland Paris,Davey Crockett Ranch,"What a magical experience!! We drove from Wales and took the euro tunnel. Driving in France was simple enough and I would definitely do it again. Keep the kids entertained in the car with pads and plenty of snacks. Stayed in Davey Crockett Ranch for three nights a land it‚Äôs a lovely place amongst the woods, it‚Äôs basically a caravan made up to look like a log cabin, very clean, spacious, warm and a nice retreat from the busy parks. It‚Äôs a five minute drive to DLP but free parking on site as staying in a Disney resort. We spent three days in the parks and they are out of this world. Loads to see and do for all ages, very magical place that you have to take the little ones. Plenty to do as a family and lots of places to eat.",
France,Disneyland Paris,Where's the magic?,"If you have been to America, you will be disappointed with Paris. Firstly, having tickets and trying to get in....a fiasco. The girl scanning at the booth couldn't get our tickets to scan, called someone else over who tried and then they looked at the ticket and said we were in the wrong queue. There was no information to say certain tickets had to be in certain queues. So she pointed to the queue we were supposed to be in and queued yet again for us to be told we were in the wrong queue....AGAIN! No one has a clue where you are supposed to be going!!! I stopped 3 people chatting and asked where do we have to go after being moved twice and they pointed and said round that corner. We joined that queue and it was the correct one. At last!!! Only an hour wasted!!!
Here's an idea....why not put people before the queuing area to guide visitors to the correct queue. So many people were getting annoyed.
But heres the funny part. After being in that queue to change our ticket to a card (no info we had to do that), we had to queue in the first queue we joined!!!
Sort it out Disneyland Paris....and while your at it....ask the staff to smile!!! The whole time we were there everyone looked miserable, except one girl in the food court. I wish I got her name.
Next, the rides. Sure they are great....if they are open. Yes, it was October but if I knew this I wouldn't have gone at that time of year. Plus, I love extreme rides and my friends don't. I asked every ride for single rider only to be told they don't do it at that time of year.....yet I was sat on my own as a single rider on most of the rides!!!!
Either do single rider or don't. Sort it out.
Also, seeing characters....you have to book???? Is that seasonal?
I felt very let down by this experience and I feel sorry for families who pay to go here and have these experiences.
Please Disneyland Paris, bring back the magic.
I can assure you I would never come back. I would rather save and do WDW in Florida. That place is amazing and the people smile and they do single riders and you just queue to see characters. They also cant do enough for you and having the queues so sorted you dont feel like you queue.","Written May 22, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Dreams come true!,"The second you walk in you know the fun is about to get real. People excitedly dashed to rides, shops and stalls. I recommend the teacups for the younger kids as it is not as fast and scary compared to other rides. The Peter Pan ride was amazing and anyone can enjoy that ride! Suitable for all ages. The Thunder Mountain was 100% the scariest ride of them all. People were loudly screaming on every drop. Young children will not enjoy this speedy ride. The ride 'Its a Small World' really gave me the chills. I don't know why but the dolls seem quite creepy.! The Buzz Lightyear ride is amazing for all ages! Disneyland Paris is definitely the place where all ages can have fun with family and friends!",
France,Disneyland Paris,"Great park, a bit far from everything","After visiting Disney Shanghai last year we knew we wanted to visit each of the Disney parks around the world. With the recent addition of Disney+ (Imagineering Ep. 2) we got to see some of the park‚Äôs history and see what rides to visit which was a good way to get us excited. The park is 45 minutes outside of Paris and can be accessed by subway. However, because of the strikes taking place the lines were less reliable so we decided to book a bus tour through @pariscityvision for 21 USD each. The bus left from their office near the Tuileries Garden at 10AM and came back at 7PM. Although they don‚Äôt stay until the park closes we still found it worth it instead of having to deal with the trains or finding an Uber ride back which cost close to 80 USD. Once inside we recommend going to Hyper-Space Mountain first and then getting fast passes for Country Thunder. Space Mountain offers a rapid start at the beginning of the ride and features a full 360 loop. Country Thunder also has a unique start because it begins on land but the entire ride sits in the middle of the lagoon so you start the ride in pitch black as you travel underwater and onto the island. The one negative we did find was in the food because all the stands were closed when we went so we were forced to eat at the restaurants.. Because of this we had a long wait of 1.5+ hours of walking around looking for food and finally eating. However, that didn‚Äôt dampen our mood and we still had a great time and look forward to the next Disneyland we get to visit!

France,Disneyland Paris,"Small disney experience, great for family fun","Full disclosure - this was my FIRST Disney experience. I have never been to any other Disney Park. However, I have been to various theme parks in North America and in terms of size, this is a relatively small park. Because of it's size, the lines get very busy very quickly. We were only able to get on about 5 rides the entire day because of how busy the rides were, and the park was not very busy. I can only imagine how long the wait is when the park is jam packed. We also did not have many options for lunch, as most places were by reservation only. I had no idea that is how it worked. The park was beautifully decorated for Christmas. I would not recommend this as a must-do activity while in Paris, unless you are looking for something to do with your kids. As two adults, we could have done without this day trip. However, that being said, it made me want to experience the magic of Disney at a much bigger park. Now that I have had a taste, I will surely be booking something to Orlando very soon.","Written April 28, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,"A Magical Time, Very Helpful and Kind Staff","We stayed at the Cheyenne ranch, which was one of the lower end hotels they offered, but frankly if this is lower end then I can't imagine what high end is. The area was a beautifully themed wild west town, and we were impressed by the detail and scale of it all. The main area had lovely western themed statues of horses and cowboys, authentic looking furniture and other fixtures, and we even saw Woody stroll though the foyer and wave to everyone. Our hotel room was similarly pretty, with a boot-shaped lamp, some pretty paintings related to Toy Story and a comfortable bed and sofa to relax on.

We didn't stick around for long in the room though and took the convenient bus that took us straight to the park. Even at the entrance you can't help but be blown away by the care and attention that has gone into this park. The fountain, the floral decoration shaped like the famous mouse himself and the scenic buildings decorating every inch. It truly is unique in terms of the care that goes into every bit of its upkeep.

After entering the park, we were instantly greeted with the Frozen 2 parade. The music floated through the air as a magnificent float loomed over, a mountain of ice shaped like a stallion with Elsa stood atop, followed by a life-sized animatronic of Sven interacting with Christoph and an array of dancers representing the elements moving to the music. A great introduction to the park, we were dazzled already.

After eating a delicious sandwich purchased on Main Street, we headed off through Frontierland to the Phantom Manor. The twisted and gnarled trees, scattered gargoyles and Gothic architecture of the manor itself already gets you ready for a ghost story before you even step in the door. The ride itself is equally spookily brilliant, with some amazing effects and fantastic characters. It was lovely to hear the sinister tones of Vincent Price's distinct voice guide you through the experience.

Next, we headed over to Pirates of the Caribbean. Again, the skull-shaped cavern spewing water from its mouth and the fantastic full-sized ship waiting in front of the entrance instantly takes you to a different world full of piracy and plunder as soon as you step through into that area of the park. The ride itself is equally thrilling, with epic scenes of pirate battles and ransacked villages, as well as ghastly spectres of pirates who still haunt the area. I could see why these two classic rides had endured for so many years, timelessly fun and unique experiences that whisk you away with Disney magic every ride.

We finished the day with the Disney Illuminations show, which blew us both away with its stunning projection mapping, synchronised lasers and illuminating fireworks. It's truly a sight to behold, how they pull off such a show every night is beyond me. Lion King, Frozen, Star Wars, The Little Mermaid and more all in one fantastic package. We watched it both nights and were just as impressed both times.

The next day we used our magic hours to get into the park early. Honestly, for these magic hours alone it's worth staying at the park. We managed to ride Big Thunder Mountain, Star Tours, Hyperspace Mountain and Autopia all in a couple of hours. My favourite being Big Thunder Mountain, there's a reason this ride is so popular. It's probably the best ride there is for thrill seekers, as you walk through the doors into a scenic mining facility you can see signs of life and history all over. Machinery and signs and buildings help tell a story as you make your way to the iconic, towering mountain. The ride itself doesn't give you a moment to catch your breath, darting around the tight corners and mine shafts of the mountain, through pitch black drops into darkness into dizzying heights as you weave through the area. Truly a ride not to be missed.

I won't go into detail on every ride we rode that day, but they were all equally expertly themed and designed. We never left an attraction feeling like it had been left to decay like some other theme parks unfortunately do.

One of the last things we did was watch Disney Stars on Parade. The sheer size of these floats is something to behold, each so detailed and littered with Disney stars dancing or waving to you. Floating fairy godmothers, the cast of Finding Nemo swimming in the air, every Disney prince and princess you could possibly imagine, the big mouse himself and much, much more. A colourful charming and spectacular thing to see.

Unfortunately during the night I fell sick and though I entered the park I eventually needed to go to the first aid area for medical help. Though this wasn't ideal for me obviously during my trip to Disney, I want to publicly thank the medical staff who went out of their way to help me and my girlfriend through this difficult situation. All of them were helpful and reassuring, guiding us through a difficult situation. The staff even allowed us to stay at the park for another night for a vastly reduced rate as we had missed our train back and paid for our taxi back from the hospital.

Frankly, I don't think they could have been more supportive in this hard time and it was very much appreciated, so I want to give them again the biggest thanks possible.

All in all we had an amazing time. We had heard mixed things on here and online which made us wary of the park. We thought we would be queuing for hours and not see much, but that couldn't have been further from the truth. I think some people should take more advantage of the Disneyland Paris app. With this we could always manage our day so we were going to the shortest queues first and could fit everything we wanted to do into our day.

The experience was wonderful, and we both hope to visit again one day when things return to normal.",
France,Disneyland Paris,I want to go back!!üíï,"My boyfriend & I stayed in the Sequoia Lodge Hotel in the Disney Village
We arrived on Tuesday the 20th of August until Thursday the 22nd of August. We had tickets for the three days that we were here for both the Disneyland Park & Walt Disney Studios. There was sometime a lot of waiting in ques for rides due to the amount of people, but that is expected when you go in the height of summer so it didn't bother me. One of my favourite items that I purchased was a glass wand from ""Merlin l'enchantuer"" which is situated inside the Sleeping Beauty Castle on the left (I would have bought more of these beautiful collectables if I had found this shop sooner (I found it on the last day) And to finish of my review (& the way Disneyland closes the park for the night), the fireworks were magical!! I cried during them because of my love for Disney. I would recommend taking a coat or a blanket with you to sit on the floor while waiting for the fireworks to start. People started to sit in front of the castle at 9pm & the fireworks don't start until 11pm. So unless you want to stand or sit on the stone pavement I'd bring something to sit on.

France,Disneyland Paris,"First Disney experience, impacted by ride failures/closures","Visited as a group including three children aged under 12 for their first Disney experience - had a Two Park Multi-Day Pass. Being at any Disney Park is great, although we found that many of the rides and attractions experienced failures and some were also totally closed (including a high volume of eating locations, like the ice cream shop on Main Street).

Fast Pass was not always available, and some queues in particular were simply too long for little ones to wait. Even using Magic Hours (from staying at a Disney property), it was very difficult to fully immerse ourselves in the Park and all it had to offer.

Luckily, as we had spread our visit across a number of days, we managed to tick off most rides and attractions, but sadly, still left with some to do. Hopefully we will be able to return and experience the full Park again in the future",
France,Disneyland Paris,Good not great. Some tips for you.,"Family visit to Disneyland in Feb 2020. It was ok/good, definitely not great. Some great memories for the kids to take away. For the parents, just try to focus on the good bits.

Main issues were waiting times for rides. We couldn‚Äôt get the fast pass to work on several machines. My 11yo son asked a staff member at Indiana Jones ride and was told nothing could be done to help us. It wasn‚Äôt until our second (and last day) that we figured out the problem with using the machines.

TIP: If you are using paper printed tickets, put some spare paper behind it when you scan it in the machine - otherwise it won‚Äôt work.

TIP: If I was to go again - I‚Äôd definitely order a premium fast pass type option for at least one day.

TIP: Best rides at Disneyland were Hyperspace mountain and big thunder mountain.

I was expecting more engagement from costumed staff with my 7yo child. I guess I expected them to be walking around rather than in one spot with a line up.

TIP: Suggest finding a good vantage point for the afternoon parade if unwilling to wait for a character experience.

From a parent perspective, it‚Äôs pretty easy to get around. The mobile app is really useful especially with wait times. Be prepared for endless merchandise shops and your children wanting something.

TIP: Best to manage your children‚Äôs expectations before the visit with (a) waiting times and (b) what they can buy.

TIP: go into a restaurant about 1130 for an early lunch before restaurants get too busy.

Most if not all hotels in the area offer a shuttle service.

TIP: if arriving by train - best to check ahead to see if you can catch the shuttle to your hotel rather than taking an expensive taxi.","Written April 4, 2020"

France,Disneyland Paris,Fun visit but different than expected,"We are lifelong Disneyland goers so our expectations were high! First the great things; very clean, not crowded, very short wait times, good food. Hyperspace Mountain was amazing - the only thing that was better when comparing to Disneyland. People were friendly and overall it was a great day! One thing that was very different was the atmosphere and vibe, very underwhelming for Disney. Didn‚Äôt feel that magical exciting feeling I usually get. Music was unrecognizable and no Disney tunes that I‚Äôm used to. Most music and shows were French but I guess that makes sense in France! There weren‚Äôt many characters out and about and many of the attractions were of much smaller scale. Indiana Jones was and outdoor coaster like the old Mulholland Madness in Disney California Adventure. Alice in Wonderful was an outdoor walk through garden with a cool little castle in the middle. It‚Äôs definitely worth a visit, happy to check it off the bucket list!",
France,Disneyland Paris,A perfect day,"We spent a perfect day in Disneyland Paris right before Christmas. The rides are great, lots of characters to meet and plenty of good restaurants and shops. Well organized and easy to get around. Recommend a full day.","Written March 23, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Great for kids. Overpriced,"Eurodisney is very good for young children, we have a 3.4 year old and he loved it. The site was very clean and well maintained, and the buildings and layout was very impressive. We all loved the Ratatouille experience, 3D interactive. Pirates of the Caribbean was also excellent, and not too scary for a three and a quarter year old. Peter Pan, Snow White and Pinocchio were also great rides for young kids, ditto Its A Small World. The Mickey & The Magician show is well worth a visit. Eateries on site were not great though, and badly over priced. The restaurant in the onsite hotel is too, BUT the Disney characters come in and meet the kids while you are eating, which saves having to queue up for them in the park itself! If you are not staying at the onsite hotel you might need to book the restaurant, which stays open long after the park closes.","Written March 19, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Dreams were almost shattered.,"When your child is walking into the gates of Disneyland Paris and turns to you and says ""My life is just about to start"" you know you've made a good decision and hopefully provided memories that will last a lifetime.
We pre bought a two day fast pass family ticket before we left Australia but my first mistake was getting to the Park just after opening. Opening was 10am but even though we had tickets we still had to line up to change our e-tickets into passes that get us into either Disneyland park or Walt Disney studios.
We decided to do Walt Disney Studios on the first day which is the newer of the two parks and had all the Star Wars shows. Being a weekend (even if it was middle winter) the place was very busy.
Second mistake, just because you have a fast pass that doesn't guarantee you'll get on a popular ride. By the time we got to meet Rey and Chewbacca (1 1/2hr wait) it was well and truly lunch time and when we went to go on our first ride our fast past was useless because there were too many other fast pass uses in front of us.
Third mistake was not to take our own food and drinks. Lines for food are huge and it's extremely expensive. To top it off by the time we did get to order the eftpos was down and therefore I had to go to the ONE ATM and line up again to get money out. Make sure you do take some cash with you just in case.
The shows were good (half in French and half in English) but we did notice that after the shows when the characters choose children for photos they would only choose kids that had bought merchandise from the over priced shops.
Day 1 done and we all left tired and slightly disappointed.
Second day - arrived earlier, booked our fast pass rides earlier, didn't have to line up for food as we had brought our own and spent an amazing day exploring Disneyland Park. This place was awesome. Day two done, exhausted but disappointment turned to happiness once again. Memories to last a life time.
Remember
Get there earlier than opening
Take some money
Take your own food
Book your fast passes early
Use the Disneyland App- very useful
Go during the week if possible.",
France,Disneyland Paris,"Two Disney Attractions, But Not Much Fun","Visited Disneyland Paris for 2 days, with two parks being Disneyland Park and Disney Studios you would expect it would be quite a fun trip. However the parks are not really that big and it is always overly crowded, with loads of families with lots of kids, it is just baby strollers everywhere you go and with crowded restaurants.

Speaking of restaurants, you are required to place a booking for some of the restaurants inside Disneyland Paris and if you decide to walk-in you would be denied entry. I know right.

The rides are what you would expect from a Disneyland, fantasy oriented and mostly for kids or Disney enthusiasts. Some of the more thrilling rides such as the Pirates of the Carribean and the Star Wars are so blurry with bad effects/lightings it is just very confusing and just overall dizzy.

All and all, great place for a romantic date. A really expensive but fantasy-filled and romantic date. Oh birthday people, get a birthday badge from the customer service from within the park, it does not exactly get you offers or anything but some of the employees will wish you happy birthdays along the way.

P.S : Go to Tokyo Disneyland, everything is better there like hands down. Both Disneyland Paris and Tokyo doesn't speak English anyways but at least the japanese don't insult you for being a non-French speaker.","Written March 16, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Not impressed,"This park doesn't live up to the expectations set by it's California, Florida, and Tokyo counter parts. It's not bad and if you've never been to a Disney park before, you'll probably enjoy it. This park doesn't have as many rides as the California, Florida, and Tokyo parks. More of the ""ride"" are just walking through something. When we went, the RailRoad, Buzz Light Year and Autotopia were closed (more rides than I expected).

The worst part of the experience was the line cutting. That seems to be a thing at Disneyland Paris.","Written March 15, 2020"

The only thing that was bad about the day was the weather as it absolutely hammered it down most of the day which ruined it a little bit! Food is expensive depending on where you go but considering your in a park I didn‚Äôt think it was any worse than theme parks in England‚Äôs prices!

France,Disneyland Paris,Shame on you Disneyland Paris!!,So many families with young children must be incredibly anxious about the fact that Disneyland Paris remains open during a Pandemic. Take a tip from cruise companies - to maintain customer loyalty put your customers first. Give the opportunity for people to rearrange for next year. I personally will never again visit.,"Written March 12, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Expensive admission but a good day.,"Spent the day here, watched the street parade and the nighttime illuminations, visited some shops - reasonable prices, went on some rides - even waited for nearly 2 hrs for one ride! If you want to do everything you would need two days but we were happy with what we saw and did within the day. Obviously midweek and the middle of winter doesn't matter with how many people attend either. Fantasyland shuts down early too because of the fireworks.",
France,Disneyland Paris,Great family fun,"but make no mistake this is an expensive outing. If you are not prepared to splash out then simply dont go. It is what it is. Enough people are prepared to go so I dont see anything changing.
That said it is all done very well. My first advice would be to plan your day(s) Check out what you want to see or do that has a fixed time and work around that.
Must see at the end of the day is the light and firework show, 20 minutes. Get your spot early especially if you have young ones, and find somewhere that young people can see if an adult is standing in front of them.
The main Parade usually at 5pm, 15 minutes. very good especially for the young ones but even us oldies enjoyed it, but again get your spot early, if you dont others will.
The show Mickey and the Magician - excellent. We were lucky enough to walk straight in. It is a half hour show. Compared to other things in the park and having seen this, it is the only thing I would be prepared to queue an hour for, full on theatre production.
Cafe Mickey- expensive dinner yes at 65 Euro per adult but the characters that appear, 5 when we were there, really work the tables and more than once. The food was actually good and the service very good. Having spent all that time with the characters it saves the queuing and possible cost of photos out in the park, you have to eat so kill two birds with one stone. The look on our Granddaughters face was worth the cost.
The park is clean, there is airport style security to get in, the shop facades are amazing and strangely perhaps the landscaping is noteworthy too.
Down side. Queues. Sometimes prohibitive, there is a limit to how long I am prepared to queue for a 2 minute ride. Try the fast pass system or single rider that is available on a couple of rides, even if two or three of you, if you dont mind being separated, but do check the waiting times it can be longer this way than the ordinary queue.
If you have young ones under about 18 months be warned they are not really catered for on any level. Buggies can not be taken onto the rides, understandably, but not even into the queues. More particularly not even for the shows. We did wait an hour for a show, suitable for 'all the family' and the young one was asleep but had to be carried for an hour, in the rain I might add, before the show started. I think you should be able to hold on to the buggy until entry if the wait is that long. The show wasn't worth that wait either, Frozen celebration, if the wait is over half an hour don't bother or come back.
Loos, not that many and not inside restaurants so use one when you see one, they were largely clean and never had to wait.
Take food in with you if you can, just not full blown picnics, to save money.
Wear comfy shoes, we walked an average of 8 miles per day!
Other do's Its a small world for everyone, Ratatouille, very good but dont queue for hours, Frozen parade, fairy boat ride by casey jones train, Mickeys PhilharMagic show, Wild west show - extra cost dinner show, good themed show, live action cowboys and indians, noisy, food better than expected.
Negatives: hanging around, lack of loos, and I am afraid some, a lot, of the staff, very officious and not at all in the Disney spirit.
Possibles, Annette's Diner, good theme and reasonable food. Princess breakfast-Good for the young ones to have a photo with a couple of princesses, they come to each table and say hello and a few other cursory words and photo then gone. Not anywhere near as good as Cafe Mickey.
If you stay in one of the Disney hotels make use of the extra hour, but if you dont get in before normal opening times there is no advantage for you, no special entrance, you queue with everyone else.
We travelled via Eurostar and it worked very well, especially the express luggage service. Luggage transported from the station to hotel (not to room) and in reverse on return so you get to spend as much time as possible in the park.
Have fun.","Written March 11, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Open half open!,"We visited for a day when it was Adults for the price of a child for 1 park. That was still ¬£59.80 each.

We visited the Disneyland park and didn't think we could have time to visit the studios all in one day.

We haven't been to Disney for a long time and was looking forward to it, although going on a february day probably wasn't ideal as it was cold and started to rain a lot.

Although we still made the most of our visit, we were rather disappointed that half of the park was closed. We logged onto the disneyland paris app and it stated only 3 rides were closed, but this was more in reality. Even the princess castle was closed for the whole visit with no explanation.

When it came to finding somewhere to eat, virtually all the restaurants were closed. over 10 of them.

We managed to find the hot dog shop on main street and the food there was just poor, not very tasty and not fulfilling.

The best part of the day was the light show at the end.

They really should just do what other parks do and close in the winter to get all their maintenance done and then open when everything is open and working so visitors get the best experience, instead of just making money and leaving visitors disappointed.","Written March 11, 2020"

We looked at the disney website and it told us to email in to cancel, we could have got 25% back at that point. The lead passenger emailed the request within the time scale to receive this refund. However, after this time elapsed, we were told the booking email had to be identical, which it was not. So no refund for us.

Saying that my 5 year old & 8 year old both gave it 5/5 so what do I know haha it‚Äôs all about them.",
France,Disneyland Paris,Magical for little ones and adults alike.,"We spent three days at Disneyland Paris, the holiday was worth every penny just to see the grandchildren‚Äôs faces. We stayed off site at the explorers hotel which was great for our family of nine, easy shuttle bus into the park that only took the same amount of time to get into the park as it does if staying at a hotel on site. Some queues were quite long but we expected this as it was half term, you could get fast passes on some rides which we took advantage of. The Mickey Mouse show was great, a must see and the fireworks/laser show was amazing. The Frozen show was great for the children as the characters come to life for them but we were disappointed with the wait (1 and a half hours!) with nowhere to sit whilst queuing with little ones, we felt that the park could have a least had some Disney characters milling around and some form of benches especially as they know that this show is aimed at smaller children and that you have to stand for the show once you enter the theatre! We managed to see 3 parades which were also brilliant and did get to go on a lot of the rides. You do now have to book to see Disney characters which was a change from when we last visited, although you can catch glimpses of them when they walk through the park to their allocated spots where the bookings take place.
Our last visit to Disneyland Paris was with our own children some years ago, when they were little, they came this time with their own children and thoroughly enjoyed it. We ate at the Disney Village mostly to keep costs down as the prices of the eateries in the park itself are expensive, as are the prices of gifts etc in all of the shops, we think that Disney are outpricing themselves, a lot more would buy if the prices in these shops was lowered.
Get into the park by 9.30am, the gates open at 10am and the queues then get longer! Plan your day if you can and get fast passes straight away so that you don‚Äôt have to queue so long. You can see the parades by the ‚Äòit‚Äôs a small world‚Äô ride if you don‚Äôt want to stand in the main square, it is less crowded. You can also take sandwiches, drinks etc into the park. We all had a great time and will definitely re-visit.","Written March 6, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Virus concern,"This review is not about Disneyland itself, but about their actions regarding Coronavirus. I called Disneyland (I think the phone went through to the US) to make sure the park was still open and they assured me that Euro Disney we‚Äôre taking extra precautions due to the virus, cleaning the rides more regularly and putting hand sanitiser out.

We were here all day yesterday and honestly didn‚Äôt see one ride being cleaned, we only saw one lot of hand sanitiser in our hotel and that was it! The man who served us our hot drinks actually clasped his hand over the top of the whole cup making contact with the lid.

We tried to keep washing our hands wherever we could, but all the water was freezing cold even though the taps had a red dot on them!

We have taken precautions by washing our hands frequently and using hand gel, but we appeared to be the only people who were taking the virus into consideration at all which is concerning as this is exactly the sort of place you could contract it!

France,Disneyland Paris,Tragic Hour in DisappointmentLand,"I've been to theme parks around the world. Universal Studios Hollywood was the best.
We went on a family trip to Disneyland Paris with our 5 year old niece. We were really excited about the Magic Passes, especially as they give you exclusive early access to the parks from 0830 to 0930 - the ""Magic Hour"". For us, not so much. As we wandered around in the cold with an excited 5 year old, turned away from rides, blocked by rope barriers, with attraction after attraction not yet open, the disappointment set in. Eventually we gave up - there's nothing open that's worth getting there early for. This is a corporation charging for a premium experience, promising great hospitality and under-delivering over and over again. It's disingenuous at best.

France,Disneyland Paris,Not THAT bad... but severely overcrowded!,"Well there are plus points - very good rides (some of them), good atmosphere, nice decor, overall clean, friendly...

And then there are the bad points. it is UNBELIEVABLY crowded. The queues are 1h+ for every ride, or worse - so then you can realistically only do 4-5 rides in one full day. That's it! Bathrooms are quite dirty, which is understandable in light of the huge amount of people in the park. Expect long queues to the bathrooms as well.

Food is expensive and not very tasty - meaning not tasty at all. What most regulars do is bring sandwiches and water with them. We've done the same and I have no regrets...

All in all, with the recent price hikes for subscriptions / anual passes, it's even less appealing... I might not even return any time soon.","Written March 4, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,ARROGANT RUDE STAFF,"My review is mainly about the staff in the parks.
I am dual nationality English/ French and speak both languages fluently so I hear and understand what they are saying.
We found the security staff at the gates arrogant, unpleasant I constantly heard them mocking people not paying attention to their jobs where they are supposed to be looking at the security scanners etc. We had to laugh when seeing some of the security patrolling the park were walking around as if they wanted to start a fight with people they had the aggressive stare on their faces they should remember where they are working. Absolute jokers !!.
Some of the employees on the rides are very dismissive to people and not helpful at all basically HORRIBLE people.
I am afraid they have not got anything on the parks in America probably would never be employed their either as they would be well below par.

France,Disneyland Paris,A long waited visit. Worth it.,"finally we did it. To start, we stayed at Davy Crockett ranch. Beautiful cabins in a forest with pool, bar and other amenities.

You will get tired. There is queue‚Äôs for everything. That‚Äôs one let down and they are long sometimes. If u are on a tight budget, trust me, everything is expensive.
If you r not staying at a Disney hotel, car park won‚Äôt be free. ‚Ç¨30 for the day. ü§™ There is an alternative car park to the Disney one. Just google it. Always wait for the end of the day. The fireworks are just amazing. Totally worth it.

France,Disneyland Paris,Magic!,"Visited for the day last week- I have been a couple of times previously (Years ago when it was Euro Disney & in Nov 2018).
Opted for the magic-shuttle which picked us up from Opera. We did have a bit of trouble trying to figure out where the bus stop was as it isn't very clear. Instructions on the ticket - 8 place de l‚ÄôOp√©ra (opposite the Lancel shop bus stop #95).
The stop is not opposite Lancel, it is just in front!
Once we managed to sort the bus, the journey there was pretty straight forward.
We arrived just before opening and was to be advised to be back at the bus stop for 7:45.

The parks themselves are huge so be prepared to do lots of walking! Hyperspace Mountain & The Hollywood Tower were my favourite rides.

I would advise downloading the DLP app as this will give you ride waiting times.

Pros: Hyperspace Mountain, themed events (Season of the Force), food/snack options
Cons: No fastpass for rides like Disneyworld Florida, long waiting times for certain rides (try & get to Rattatouile & Crushes Coaster as these are the longest wait), had to leave early for the bus so missed the fireworks :(","Written March 3, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Absolutely Terrible,"I am literally so upset/disappointed after returning from a 4 night break. We had originally booked Florida, but due to Thomas Cook going into liquidation and the crazy hike in prices we decided to book Disney Paris with another family holiday. I, like many others have grow up with the magic of Disney. It‚Äôs a magical experience still going into the Disney Store and seeing all the merchandise with you favourite character on. This is the only good thing I have to say about Disney Land Paris. The shops are absolutely amazing. There is loads of shops, granted selling the same items but beautifully displayed in some amazing buildings. If you are looking to eat in the park it‚Äôs full of junk food, not even guilty pleasure junk food. Literally a load of rubbish, what makes it worse is the prices! 50 Euro for two ‚Äúadult fast food meals‚Äù and a kids meal. Tiny portions, thrown together and the lines are just ridiculous. You wait over 30 minutes and spend another 10 looking for a seat. The queues for the rides are terrible, over an hour and a half for some without fast pass, that‚Äôs when the machines are on for fast pass. I downloaded the Disneyland app which shows which rides are on, the wait time and location. My daughter is absolutely Stitch mad and wanted to see her favourite character. We looked on the map before we left and noticed ‚ÄúStitch live‚Äù was in the studios. The only other half decent ride in that park was Tower of Terror, we paid over ¬£160 for tickets to enter the park as stupidly I thought Stitch live would be actual Stitch. We walked towards the Haunted Mansion after we completed the rest of the park, we noticed big queues in the corner and eventually noticed it was Stitch. We didn‚Äôt check ‚Äúmeet and greet‚Äù on the app as we already thought Stitch would be in the Studio. We approached around 4pm to be told that an app would need to be downloaded and a ticket would need to be secured. ‚ÄúLineberty‚Äù never heard of it, you search Disneyland Paris and select your meet and greet. I noticed groups of teenage boys with their girlfriends who left the line, a number of other adults left and we were still not allowed access. I explained the ticket we had bought for Studios shoes Stitch live, if he‚Äôs not live why present it like this. How confusing! My daughter dressed head to toe was clearly upset and as a parent I felt awful. The staff said to wait till 5pm and see what they could do. We hung around and the lady said that she wouldn‚Äôt be able to let us in, even though you see people leave the line. A lovely lady overheard and offered us a ticket and the staff allowed us to enter. We waited around 1.5 hours in the freezing cold, but luckily we seen him. A thank you to the staff allowing us and the kindness of a stranger that saved my guilt. Please look at the app and times, apparently as soon as the app is open tickets are booked instantly. Don‚Äôt get caught out by the Studio tickets. The majority of the rides were shut, the lines were between 60-80 minutes and we went on one ride for 160 Euro. Disappointed to say the least! The magic has totally gone compared to my last visit over 15 years ago. It all seems like a money making cash cow. Security is good, armed guards and metal detectors. The free Disney Shuttle from previous comments seems to be a disaster waiting to happen. We paid 6 Euro in an Uber which was much easier. The castle is beautiful, but we for what we paid I hate Thomas Cook even more now! People are rude and arrogant, bumping into you and pushing you along. Lots of locals trying to jump the queues and pushing you. The whole trip was an expensive disaster.",
France,Disneyland Paris,Fantastic Park for Autistic children.,"Very friendly staff at both the studio and park, used the green card system for the boys which was phenomenal.

Without exception the staff were courteous and had obviously had training for guests with special needs.

At ALL shows/attractions/rides we had no issues - the only ride off limits to guests with autism is the toy story drop due to the possible issues if it breaks down.

Food on site is expensive as most people suggest - ‚Ç¨17.00 for a burger and chips is high - solution, walk 5 mins into Disney village and use McDonald's or Starbucks for lunch......cheaper option walk to the railway station( also 5 mins) and pay UK/Ireland prices - if you do your homework it will save you money.

Would return again as it was so positive for the boys!..... Great to see a company get it 100% right!

.....a word of caution on hotel buses, look for the yellow lines on the pavement at the bus stop - this is where the doors open. There is no etiquette when getting on the buses at the end of the day. We saw 2 shoving matches between guests in 4 days and numerous rows. It gets very very busy and with buses every 20 mins you need to be mercenary with your own family and get them on quickly!.....you have been warned!","Written March 1, 2020"

France,Disneyland Paris,very nice weekend getaway withe the kids,We've planned the trip to paris for a long time. We took the train and managed to find it very easy. The park is massive and the kids enjoyed every bit of it.,"Written March 1, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Better than expected,"Having previously visited the Florida park I had been warned by multiple people that Paris would not live up to my expectations as it was run down, messy and small.
I went in with low expectations but have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The park looked great on arrival and was very clean. The staff were all polite and enthusiastic and I felt the same Disney magic as Florida. Yes Disneyland as a whole is smaller but I actually enjoyed this element of it. We stopped in a Disney hotel (separate review for this) and could easily walk to both Disneyland parks and the shopping area. The train station is also right outside the park with direct links to Paris and the airport which made travelling extremely easy. If you have young children this is a great park for these reasons... you can go back to the hotel and swim/relax before heading back out for the evening shows.
I also think the castle itself is nicer than Florida, you can go inside and walk around. The parades and evening fireworks are also really good.
Travelling during the holidays the park was busy at times and some of the ride wait times are long.. During our stay this was around the same wait times as other theme parks and something I had expected. If staying in Disney make the most of the magic hours and fast passes as the rides were much easier to access.
The food is also not fantastic. Lots of fast/junk food.. not many healthy options. I found this same issue in Florida to be honest and it is one of the most frustrating things about Disney. I am aware of some people taking in their own snacks/lunches so this may be a better option if you can.
Overall I had a lot of fun and would visit again.","Written March 1, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Commercial trap,"I had always tried to avoid mentioning this to my children (aged 11 and 13) but they eventually found out about Disneyland Paris and were begging to go. So we booked a 2-day stay. The hotel was ok (Newport Bay) and we ended up spending time at its swimming pool rather than at the park. Admittedly we were unlucky with the weather (cold and rainy) but we were not happy at all with the park. Way overcrowded: you had to queue for everything, from food to photos with Disney characters and then for the attractions, when they were not closed for technical reasons - which in some cases we suspect were not really technical reasons but staffing/shift problems. Basically our feeling is that they stack as many people as possible, give them as little service as possible (but always with kindness and big smiles) and make them wonder around as much as possible so they spend time walking between places instead of at attractions (why is there no direct passage between Disneyland and Disney Studios - it only allowed for staff? Why can't you book your attraction-specific fastpass through the app rather than having to go to the attraction itself?). There are too many souvenir shops, but then people do go a little overboard with Mickey Mouse headbands and other ridiculous props they only dare to wear there. But strangely enough, there is no queue at the tills... that they can manage.
On the attractions side, they are mostly for younger kids with patient parents (up to 2 h queues on a cold and wet February day!) or crazy ones that even adults may prefer to avoid (in my case for instance, rollercoasters in the dark make me seasick) - but it is not even easy to have the information as to what the ride is actually about, Couldn't that be included in their app ? The queuing time is indeed in the app and is very discouraging, while the fatspass time is not in the app so when you walk to a place to get a fastpass you have no idea for when you can expect it unitl you're right there already, and then maybe it is not available at all anymore.
Basically, I will never set foot there again for sure, there are far better amusement parks where you can actually have fun and avoid the Disney scam.","Written March 1, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Freezing but fun.,"First time we have been in several years and not sure that a freezing cold rainy Saturday in February is the ideal time to visit. Nevertheless we had a lot of fun despite the weather and a few of the rides (train, Buzz Lightyear and Peter Pan) being closed.","Written March 1, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,A beautiful theme park,"Disneyland Paris is the most beautiful theme park I've ever seen. Every land in the park has a consistent theme and look. There are some great rides, like Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. There are plenty of rides for the whole family as well. The walk-through attractions are delightful - the Alice in Wonderland Maze, the Nautilus, and the play area in Adventureland are great fun. And don't miss the dragon in the cavern below the castle - it's one of the best things in the park. The night-time fireworks show is outstanding!

The food in this theme park is disappointing. A lot of the fast food options really are just burgers and fries. Also, many of the food options inside the theme park close surprisingly early. Go for the rides and theming, not the food.",
France,Disneyland Paris,Magical! Don‚Äôt miss the illuminations show.,"Beautiful and magical Disney park, with plenty of activities for children and a few great rides for adults. The best more adult oriented rides are: Star Wars Hyperspace, Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Indiana Jones et le Temple du Peril, Phantom Manor.
The lights and fireworks show at the end of the day (in Feb we had it at 7:30pm) is not to be missed, it is trully magical.
One negative: the food is outrageously expensive, it comes in small quantities and there is a distinct lack of healthy options. One person in our party was vegan. We found two vegan options (a wrap and a salad) but again: very small and very expensive. I would recommend bringing along some packed snacks and some water.
The souvenirs are also expensive but this is to be expected. There are preety and tempting choices on offer.
There is good transport from Paris city centre (we took a dirrect train from Arc de Triomphe - it stops in other stations too - the cost is around 8 euro per person for one way).
All is all, I would recommend Disneyland Paris. A shame it is near Paris, which I don‚Äôt personally like all that much as a city.",
France,Disneyland Paris,Just amazing,"People told me I'd love it and that my children would but it was even better than we could have imagined...

Lots of walking, lots of queuing and lots of people walking across your path and not giving a damn.

Enjoy
Night show on Castle... Simply amazing

Micky and the Magician show... Unbelievable

Frozen experience show... Long queue but superb

Ratatouille ride... Highly recommend

Pirates of carribean... V good

Stunt show... Awesome

Big thunder Mountain... Excellent

Mickey 4D show... Class

It's a small world... Amazing for kids

Autopia... My 6 year old loved driving

Don't queue too long for
Pinnochio ride

There are 3 very similar rides
Alladin carpet, elaphants and orbitron... I would do Alladin of the 3.

So so much to do but don't miss the Disney illuminations and parade in main park and Mickey and magician in the studios park

Can't wait to go back",
France,Disneyland Paris,Had the best time of my life,This is the place to go for a first holiday or even a holiday it does have to be a first holiday the tickets are cheap and there is a train what goes to the shopping centre for 1 euro 40 cents,"Written February 27, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Very disappointed 2nd trip,"The first time we as a family of 2 adults and 4 children visited Disney Paris in May we had the most amazing time (stayed at Davey Crockett). The whole place was buzzing, clean and vibrant with very few long queues to get on the rides.

Holidaying to Disney is not a cheap affair but we felt the first time it was well worth it. Kids had multiple goes on their favourite rides, epic!

How disappointed we were with our second visit in Feb half term 2020. Unbeknown to us did we hadn't realised it was the French school holidays too. Queues were 3 hours long on some of the most popular rides. It was a dreadful experience and we all wanted to be somewhere else. OK, to be fair with the rides... they were worth the wait FOR A SPLIT SECOND afterwards but once you finished your adrenaline rush the high was well and truly over. The thought of standing bored for another couple of hours was far too much to bear. In total, we managed to get on 5 rides over TWO days. Great value for money at ¬£300 per ride!!!!

It was mid-Feb, the sun wasn't shining but the place looked run down. In my mind I was thinking about the Florida Disney and it started to become clear why many of my friends would rave about the US version of Disney. Would we go back to Paris? We love Paris! But spend close to 3k on 4 nights accommodation and 2-day park tickets again? Probably not. We stayed at Villages Nature and that is another review on its own. Awful place, if you like the UK Centerparcs you will not like staying in the Disney version.

In a nutshell, we didn't feel we got value for money. If we had spent a few hundred pounds fair enough, it's Disney. But at 3k per family for 4 days - would rather holiday somewhere sunny abroad and have total relaxation... with no queuing!","Written February 26, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Disappointed,"Do not eat at Disney .. even my son 6 years old didn‚Äôt like the chicken nuggets and fries which is a first.
With a fast pass not usable on every attraction pirates and small world takes at least one hour ( make sure kids go for a pee before queuing)
H√¥tel Disneyland the best hotel there .. dates back to the 90s and nothing done since .. restaurent 200 euros for 3 .. a very average buffet and our son was sick at 5 in the morning .. food intoxication.
Everything costs money .. tickets fast pass one night at hotel diner .. could have gone to Greece for a week in a really nice family hotel ..
The attractions are still fun , the fire works and light display worth while but all in all a nightmare and rip off.

There‚Äôs plenty to do and see to fill a week too, with a decent selection of eateries.
The queues are also as you‚Äôd expect - all the ‚Äúmain‚Äù rides have queues for hours which can ruin a day pretty quickly. You may end up only doing 2-3 rides in a day if these are what you want to be on..

France,Disneyland Paris,Fun day,"This was my first time in any Disneyland park after growing up on Disney and it was everything I could have wanted. Yes, the lines are long, some moving faster than others, but that's to be expected. The rides were worth it though. We stayed from open to close (roughly) and were able to go on the major rides we wanted. Fast Pass in the future might be worth it just for the opportunity to possibly go on more. I really enjoyed my time and was sad to leave.

Also, if you're visiting Disneyland, I would suggest staying in Val d'Europe. It wasn't busy at all even though it was UK half term and there were good restaurants nearby. The trip to Disneyland was maybe 5 mins, if that!","Written February 24, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Disney is Busy. Characters are getting harder to see,"We went in February half term. My advice is to go at the beginning of the week and not the end and you will need a few days in the park at least not because it is massive, but because the queue lines are very long. There‚Äôs a few rides which have a free fast pass and that‚Äôs it. You would need to pay a lot extra to queue jump on the paid fast passes making your expensive trip even more. There‚Äôs also not much in the queue lines to entertain the kids!

There are a few characters jotted around the park including a Disney princess pavilion and a Mickey house where you can queue to meet and greet them other than that all the other character meet and greets are on a first come first served App which never works and instantly runs out of time slots for the whole day within 10 seconds making it really disappointing for young children seeing the characters but never being able to cuddle them, everyone was moaning in the park about this and it was a big problem. Everyone in our group got on the app to book a time slot and never got anything.

We found 2 other options for seeing the main characters such as Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald and Pluto. Stay in the Disney hotels as they have a meet n greet the characters in there lobby‚Äôs from 8.15-11 every morning and tbh you can probably just walk into them without staying there! or do a character dining experience. We did all including the explorers restaurant- this restaurant was more of a fine dining Buffet and didn‚Äôt really have much for the kids and was the most expensive option. ¬£75 per adult I think and alittle cheaper for kids so really not worth the money in my opinion. The characters did come round and do autographs and photos but only around 3 times so if you were queuing for the buffet you could actually miss them and they don‚Äôt come back. The restaurant however was smaller.

The other character dining experience we did was the Mickey cafe. This place had more of a child friendly menu and I would recommend booking the late dinner option after the fireworks in the park. This place at that time was less busy so the characters came round each table a lot more and made it more of a personal experience rather than explorers.","Written February 23, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,"Magical, but expensive","We visited for the first time for my 30th birthday with our two young children. It was magical and everything we could have wanted. It was a good time of year, pretty quiet and queues not too long. Loved Space Mountain!! Whilst it was excellent, it was overpriced in the park. 3 hotdogs, 1 chicken nuggets and a Fanta to share cost ‚Ç¨43! Pack plenty of snacks and drinks. 1x50cl Bottle of water was more than a pack of 6x1ltr bottles in Val De Europe. Frozen dress was about ‚Ç¨80, looks the same as our ¬£16 one from Sainsburys!!! We did have a great time and look forward to going back. Recommend a push chair if you have 3/4year old!! Other than the prices, I think there needs to be more toilets. They‚Äôre not well placed and always big queues, not good with a 3yr old.",
France,Disneyland Paris,Worth visiting,"In my opinion, it's a great place to visit for families in Western Europe and the UK. Staff are friendly and there is a great range of attractions for the whole family, and it's also well connected with Eurostar and SNCF service stopping at the nearby Marne-la-Vallee train station.","Written February 23, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,"Magical, but Overpriced","It was an experience, certainly. It was definitely magical, and the illuminations were beautiful. It's a small world was also a highlight of our trip, and thunder mountain was great as well. However, the prices are ridiculous. All shops on-site are overpriced, and the items are typically of low-quality.
Food was also an issue. Everywhere had massive queues, which shouldn't be right considering the prices of food. Vegetarian food was also difficult to find. That was certainly a disappointment, but it shouldn't ruin the trip. I'd definitely recommend bringing snacks if you are planning on spending a whole day in the parks.
Another disappointment was the haunted mansion ride. It was terrible- DO NOT GO ON THIS RIDE IF YOU HAVE CLAUSTROPHOBIA! There were too many people crammed into one small room, and it felt impossible to breathe. It felt like they were just trying to put as many people through as they possibly could at once. It wasn't good, especially if you have sensory issues.
I'd say, still go, but be prepared.","Written February 23, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Where has the magic gone?!,"My party of 4 adults and 2 children have just returned from 7 days in France, we had a 4 day hopper pass for Disneyland costing over ¬£1000. During our stay we met one character due to the queue times and reservations you now have to make to meet them. We were basically faced with a choice of paying to queue and meet the limited characters now available or go on the rides. We attempted to queue to see my daughters favourite character ‚Äòstitch‚Äô to be shouted at by one of the staff members because we didn‚Äôt have a reservation. When we asked how we make a reservation we were told ‚Äòit‚Äôs finished for the day, you can‚Äôt meet him‚Äô. This left my daughter upset and us without anyway of getting to meet the character she came to see. The same staff member then shouted at us and told us he was getting security because we had walked the wrong way round to join a queue (we joined the back of the line). My children were incredibly upset and thought security would arrest us and remove us from the park. Aside from the one character we met, the staff are incredibly rude and remove all magic of the park with their miserable faces and bad attitudes. The queue times for all rides are incredibly long, averaging 100mins and we managed to get on 3-4 rides per day. We are great full we had the 4 day pass for this reason. They appear to have no maximum limit to the amount of people they allow into the park. I remember visiting when I was younger and experiencing the magic. I wanted to emulate this for my children. Unfortunately this is now just a theme park and all the magic and the joy of meeting characters has been removed. What an expensive disappointment! My children‚Äôs autograph book has one sorry looking Pluto autograph inside! Will not be returning.",

France,Disneyland Paris,"Lovely people, lots of queues","We had 5 nights at the resort, staying in one of the Disney hotels and eating on a meal plan. I‚Äôll review those separately but all pretty good

The park....The queue to get in was long, between security and ticket barriers we took about 39-40 minutes, often caused by poorly printed online tickets. Once we we didn‚Äôt focus on the big rides and just wandered, it‚Äôs easy to miss some tiny magical things such as;

The man carving (taking 2 hours) watermelons into disney characters, Swiss family Robinson island and The Nautilus. All small details but what makes the park a bit special.

The bad bits...very busy and long queues, all food stalls open in the studio but half shut in the main park meaning a 30 minute queue for a drink (why not move some staff over). A lot of bits boarded off for maintenance

The exceptional bit....our son got poorly and we needed both a doctor and first aid, the staff, first aid post and hotel were wonderful, it really helped

Overall, if you want rides then expect some serious queues but just wandering was great (if expensive)",
France,Disneyland Paris,Needs more attractions. Queues are massive and oh rob a bank if you want to eat out there.,Just come back from DLP. Having been to Orlando a couple of times the I thought the Disney banner would have more of an impact on the park. Whilst I can‚Äôt say anything is bad I can‚Äôt find one thing the made me go wow apart from the prices. They made it captive and you basically have to go to the massively overpriced restaurants. Queues are way to long due to the lack of rides/attractions. My advice would be to save the extra money needed to trip across to America and enjoy the real magic of Disney. Think the rip off prices and lack of service put a dampener on my trip. Proves a point when people are eating packed lunches whilst in the queues for the rides.,
France,Disneyland Paris,"First timer, single parent","After months of being on Facebook pages, asking questions, buying the ears, teddies and personalised hoodies and water bottles, the time came for me to take my 5 year old son on our first trip abroad together. I've tried to think of the must know Things that will help a first timer so here goes...
Got the best deal through magic breaks, even independent travel agent couldn't match it. I opted for the private transfer but although it was easy getting to the hotel they left me and my son stranded on the return journey so we had to jump on the magic shuttle which was a third of the price and almost empty. I'd definitely think about using magic shuttle next time.
Stayed at Santa Fe. Loved it. Shuttle bus to and from the park is literally minutes and never had a problem getting one, even as everyone left when the park closed.
Had standard meal plan but as my son was so overly excited and I was worried about him we didn't make full use of the all you can eat buffet which was a shame. We booked online using links. The dlp guide gives a list of where you can book with what meal plan. You can book 2 months in advance. Loved La Cantina in Santa Fe and Plaza gardens. Think carefully about timings as there are the parades and fireworks to take into consideration.
If staying in a Disney hotel you get a magic pass which has your park entry and meal/event bookings on so don't lose them.
Magic Hours are a must, hardly any queues to get in then head straight for the most popular rides before the park opens.
Our 1st day we arrived at lunch and queue to get through security was 20 minutes then another 20 minutes to get into the park which set the tone for the rest of the day...queues, queues and more queues (this is February half term, not bad in term time). Yes you can get fast passes for some rides but you have to queue for those then keep yourself busy til your time and head back to stand in a shorter queue. Made more sense to just go to the popular rides in the magic hours.
Absolute favourite things was the inventions restaurant meet and greet lunch, saw 5 characters in 30 mins, unlike the park where you have to queue for 1. Get a programme or use the app to see the frozen parade, main parade and illimuniations. Be warned, they will cancel in bad weather so don't put it off.","Written February 22, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,"All water fountains were turned off - really annoying for February half term, imagine it in the summer.","Negatives- If you like to queue then this is certainly the place to go. It's not just the queue for rides, but then the toilets, restaurants, shows, food, drinks and the entrance too and from each park. Also the water fountains were all turned off outside the toilets and around the park. We managed to find two which worked and we refilled our bottles there, but very poor for such an expensive day out. Don't provide any if you want to turn them off.

Positives: I was really pleased with the free fast pass for some rides offered every two hours. This helped us organise our day to go on the smaller rides first while waiting for the larger rides. We also had entry to the park 2 hours before it opened so we actually never queued more than 30 mins for any ride over the 4 days.
It was very clean and very friendly all the staff around the park. The app was accurate for times to wait for the rides too. Maybe the app should be easier to follow for things happening throughout the day like parades and times of shows.
I was shocked that the rides for 1.2m were suitable for 5 year old children. I never knew what to expect, but my son was desperate to go on the rides and hit the height, but regretted it straight after. However, my daughter at 7 years did enjoy the ride. So maybe the age needs to be addressed with the height.
Most of the fast rollercoaster were in the dark, which to be honest was scarey and has put me off travelling to Florida until the kids can go solo on the rides.

Overall the park was easy to navigate and well organised. Take plenty of water, food/snacks hats, gloves, scarfs and sunglasses as it was sunny but cold. Download the app to help you and get fast pass tickets every two hours instead of queueing.

The retail was an overkill. I know they make more money on merchandise, but shops are everywhere selling overpriced Disney stuff. Make sure you get your Disney wears Primary before you go, take dressing up clothes and Disney teddies to save your children asking for more once your there. Take cheap ponchos too if it rains.

France,Disneyland Paris,Worst trip in 5 years,"I have just come back from a week at Disney, we had a 4 day multi park ticket and what a waste of money it was, I have being going to Disney for the last 5 years and this is by far the worst visit, there was no mention of any rides not in operation, we take our 10 year Autistic son who loves the place, his favourite ride is Buzz Lightyear, this ride wasn‚Äôt in operation, we tried to take him to the Frozen show, as we have a green card we went to the exit only to find this sarcastic women(Gaele & Melody wouldn‚Äôt allow us entry as this is apparently classed as a show/parade even though is clearly marked as an attraction, I had to asked Gaele on several occasions to stop raising her voice as she was upsetting my son, Melody who apparently is a team leader was also overpowered by Gaele and her raised voice, we only went to the theme park 3 days out of the 4 because of the upset this caused my son.","Written February 21, 2020"

France,Disneyland Paris,Dont waste your time,"Went with 8 and 12 year old. 3rd visit. Due to refurbishment less rides so more queues. Very poorly organised. After security no discernable queing system so took an hour to get into studio. Food queues were appalling. Twice we were behind people who had problems with vouchers. Instead of taking them aside and dealing with the issues so others could be served we waited forabout half an hour to be served. Fast food?
Portaventurer in costa dorada is much better value and knocks spots off this. Dont waste your time.","Written February 21, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Just too few rides open,"The parks are lovely, close together and great to walk around, which is what you will be doing 95% of the time given the horrendous queues at the most popular rides. These are even worse at the moment as many main rides such as Studio Tour, Rock and Roll Coaster, Buzz Lightyear, are all closed for refurb and various others broke down or were closed due to the weather.

So download the app to see waiting times, then try and plan your day around the queue length. Typically 85 mins plus on main rides all day and 30 minutes on smaller rides., so expect to do 2 or 3 main rides in a day.

Twilight entry for hotel stay offers zero benefit as they don't open enough security points or turnstiles at 8.00am - 9,30am to cope, so all you do is queue at 8.30am rather than park opening time at 10.00am.

Once inside, few characters about, again large queues to meet them, and the Disney magic is trumped by Disney retail.

You'll need to go for 2-3 days to do it all, not because of size of parks but because there are so few rides open.

Still, once you get on them they are great, shows are good and nightly light and firework display is incredible","Written February 21, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Great February weekend!! Forgot how good Disney can be,"We were a family group of 15 which included children aged 3,4 & 7. The waits for the rides were ridiculous and that was in February! You can't possibly expect young children to wait in line for 60 minutes (as was the Dumbo ride) and then just have a few minutes on the ride. The place was very clean with staff walking around with long handled dustpans and brushes cleaning up what people had thrown down rather than put in bins. There were shops and eateries everywhere but not that many rides. We stayed in one of the on-site hotels so had a 'magic' pass which allows you into the park before it opens at 10 a.m. However, you need to go in between 8.30 and 9.30. We did that once and there were very few rides open! Those that were had a 40 minute wait, so no advantage to going early. If you can afford a 'fast pass' it might be better, but don't rely on that as some of those queues were long as well. Everything very expensive, but I expected that. Once you are in the park there is no need to spend money unless you want to (take your lunch in with you). I'm sure you will spend some though as the children will want something from the many shops. I wouldn't bother to go again. Be prepared for a great deal of walking and queuing.","Written February 21, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Not well run,"For anyone who has been to the Orlando Disney, this place is not well run and not worth the time. Our pre-purchase tickets did not register and it took 45 minutes just to get to the front of the Guest Relations line. Everyone on that line was so angry before even entering the park.

Not only that, several of the Fast Pass rides were not working properly the day we visited. With the limited options on the Fast Pass to begin with, it was not worth it.

Both parks are extremely small. There isn't much to do or see.

If you live in Europe and need to be in a Disney Park, this is your only option. For those from the U.S., it's a frustrating experience and a weak facsimile.","Written February 20, 2020"

France,Disneyland Paris,Great day,"Was an excellent day even in all the rain we still really enjoyed it all. The line up for character meet ups wasn‚Äôt too bad, and we didn‚Äôt find the park too busy when we went. I definitely want to return",
France,Disneyland Paris,Save your money stay away,Went with my 2 kids 10 and 6 for 3 days. It was the longest 3 days of my life. One of the days we spend 10 hours in the park and only got on 4 rides because of the queues. The rides are nothing special and we didn't meet micky are any other cast or princess. I will say the illmations was magical the castle coming alive at night was unbelievable but the money we spend for the under advarage experience was not worth it. The food was so bad cheep crap you wouldn't give to your dog being charged over 100euro for a family. Go on a beach holiday 4 times in 1 year for the same price as a few days at disneyland paris. Staff are friendly but you will come away feeling robed. So gutted this is a holiday I was so excited to bring my kids on I dreamed of disney as a child myself but it is not even close to what it's being advertised and sold to you as. Please save your money and stay as well away from these crooks as possible.,"Written February 19, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Disappointed,"First time in Disney 2 adults, 1 teen, 1 child. Arrived with no expectations however believed it to be Amazing, magical, overwhelming etc the full Disney experience however in reality it is an overpriced underwhelming money pit with a Disney stamp.
Entrance fee for 4 is over a weeks wage alone.
The rides were nothing special and have been on better in normal theme parks. The park is over ran with repetitive shops and crep stalls. Fast passes end approx 2pm so pointless and ride Qs are approx 60 mins plus so get very little done if you go on 2/3 rides. Little to no characters walking around the park where is the Disney magic?
The only real Disney feel is in the stores which were way to expensive and can buy cheaper elsewhere.
I wouldn‚Äôt return for free and can‚Äôt understand how people go for 4/5 days.
The parade obviously has had a lot of effort put into it - if I can‚Äôt actually find a space to watch it!
The hype is better than the reality.
The best part of the day was a picture infront of the castle. There really isn‚Äôt that much to do or see!
This theme park is average at best.","Written February 19, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Wow sixth time here,"Over the past 20;years my wife and I have taken our children and now their grandchildren. I‚Äôm a big kid when here always something new and amazing. We stayed in Sequoia Hotel and upgraded to Golden Forest lounge well worth it.
We have stayed at all hotels all fun fun fun.
Buffalo show worth it food with show.
We only gave it four stars as it is expensive to eat. No other options to go to.",
France,Disneyland Paris,Queues take all the fun out of it,"I spend about 3-4 hours of the time at the park queuing to get onto rides. The worst being the Indiana Jones ride which quoted a 45 minute wait on the app which was actually about 75 minutes. This was completely unnecessary and was due to the fact the Disney employees insisted on allowing every person with a fast pass on before people in the regular queue. The rides themselves were thoroughly enjoyable but the queues will be my lasting impression of Disneyland Paris, I understand people pay extra for fast passes but the system definitely needs a rethink.","Written February 19, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,Great holiday,"We visited Disneyland with my son who has Type 1 diabetes. We were able to get a green card because of his disability enabling us to queue in a different place with shorter queues. The staff were very helpful and friendly and made my son feel special. The park was very clean. My only criticism would be the food on offer, limited options and very expensive, but we had a great holiday.","Written February 19, 2020"
France,Disneyland Paris,3 generation visit,"Day1; Disney Parc with pre purchased fast pass ;
Having wavered over the purchase of the expensive fast pass option for day 1 of our 2 day euro disney visit we were so pleased we had bought them: although you can get free fast passes at the attractions they are limited both in supply and when you can use them. Our fast passes enabled us to do everything in the Parc at our own pace and to get round comfortably. The only down side was that the purchased fast pass covered both the Parc and the studios but we had opted to purchase tickets for each separately so couldn‚Äôt use the fast pass on day 2 at the studios - something that isn‚Äôt made clear on purchase.
Our granddaughter had a brilliant time - the more terrifying the ride the better she liked it (she‚Äôs 9!) and we loved seeing her so happy. The light show at the end of the day was a wonderful finale.

Day 2. Studios
By now we‚Äôd worked out the free fast pass system so managed to get them for Ratatouille and Tower of Terror: Crush already had a 90 minute wait time when the park opened so we didn‚Äôt bother with that (no fast pass option).
Our granddaughter enjoyed meeting Mickey and the various shows (Frozen and stunt show) and again loved the scary rides.

At both the Parc and the studios there seemed to be a shortage of places to sit and have a snack or coffee break but I guess that‚Äôs deliberate to keep you moving (and spending!).

We had a good meal in the steak restaurant opposite the steam ship in the Parc - be warned, if you want to eat you need to make reservations well ahead of time for popular restaurants - don‚Äôt leave it until you get there as most places were fully booked.

Don‚Äôt expect to do Eurodisney on a budget - everything is expensive - and personally I wouldn‚Äôt take very young children as they wouldn‚Äôt get the most out of it - we saw lots of young children fast asleep in buggies - I think they need to be at least 7 to really enjoy it but that‚Äôs a personal opinion...","Written February 19, 2020"

France,Disneyland Paris,Thoroughly disappointing,"Terrible. Had to wait over an hour for every ride!! Even the not so good ones. Only got to see about half want wanted to because the lines were so massive! Kids were very disappointed!

Even having fast track tickets we had to wait over 30/40minutes. And then we were only allowed 2 fast tracks per day!!

No subtitles either, I know it‚Äôs in France but I expected subtitles at least! after waiting an hour in line to the star wars ride then not being able to understand a word was infuriating!!

Thousands of people walking around, well over capacity, almost unsafe! I wonder what would happen in an emergency! I imagine small children would be trampled!!

France,Disneyland Paris,Make a wish,So we came to Disney on a make a wish foundation trip for my daughter. The rides were fab and all the characters and the kids absolutely loved it. We had a genie pass so we could skip the queues. I personally wouldn‚Äôt recommend coming to Disney without a fast pass as some of the ride queues were 70 mins. I can‚Äôt imagine you will experience many rides in a day without fast pass. And waiting so long takes all the fun out of it. We did the buffalo bills Wild West show which was really fun and the food was nice. I felt sorry for the poor guy in the ice cream shop. A queue out the door all day and he is the only one serving. I don‚Äôt understand why there isn‚Äôt more staff to serve customers so your queuing about 40 mins just to get an ice cream. We also did the princess dinner which I would not recommend to anyone. The restaurant is dark and dingy nothing special about it at all. We had been there 1 and a half hours and had still only been served our starter. It cost 244 euros for 2 adults and 2 kids and the food was terrible and hardly any choice. Especially not for kids. And the whole time we were there only 1 princess came to our table. As this was a make a wish trip I wanted it to be really special for my girl but it was terrible and we couldn‚Äôt wait to get out of there. Other than that the place is magical and amazing :),"Written February 17, 2020"

We enjoyed a long morning here visiting numerous attractions and stopping at coffee shops. There are lots of small boutique type shops selling goods that you wouldn't get in the large shops in the centre of towns.

France,Vieux-Lille,"Beautiful buzzing city, not very 'touristy'","In Lille you find a fantastic French town which seems to be busy 24/7.

The architecture is fantastic, and everything is easily within walking distance.

Surprising lack of 'tourist attractions' which is refreshing i.e. you won't find people taking you in tours and no 'waxworks' 'day trips' etc. Lots of cafes that seem to be always open, little boutique shops and larger shopping centres.

It's very easy to find your way around without getting lost, plenty of little shops and cafes to discover.

The locals generally speak a bit of English, but as it's not a prime tourist destination, it's advisable to know a little bit of basic French. Some restaurants do offer English menus, but most will just have the French with no translation.

Excellent train links, easy to nip over to Ghent in Belgium!

France,Vieux-Lille,Charming old town but not the liveliest of places.,"We spent the best part of two days in Lille. We stayed in L'Hermitage Hotel, a short(ish) walk from the old town. We were there on a Sunday and a Monday in April. One of our challenges was finding somewhere to eat in the evening as many of the restaurants seemed to be closed on those two days. On Sunday night, however, we found La Tradition, a delightful restaurant not far from the hotel. The food was excellent and so was the service. On the Monday evening, however, we ate at a restaurant close to La Grande Plaza which was very average.
The town itself is charming with many interesting streets, varying architectural styles and many different shops. It also has a fine art gallery and one or two historical attractions. It is not, though, the most exciting place in France. One can only speculate, but it probably gets livelier during the summer season?","Written May 21, 2018"

The old town has lots of quaint shops, restaurants, along cobbled streets (wear sensible shoes ladies not heels). The market on a Sunday is nice but you need to get there around 9am, it sells mainly produce and is quite nice. The shops in the old town and high street are mainly closed like most of France on Sundays as are the supermarkets though. It makes a nice weekend visit but not much longer, or a good place to stop on your way to another town.

France,Vieux-Lille,Delightful - 5-Star town.,"The town of Lille is beautiful on any day of the year.

I visited the town on a day (Fri Dec 1 of this year - 2017) when the region had just had a day and night of snow, and the streets were iced. Yet, despite intense cold and the slippery streets, my visit was not spoiled.

The town is easy to 'navigate', and almost every third building has an eating place on the ground floor.Prices are steep but where in France (indeed in Europe) are prices not steep?

Currently, and until the end of this month (December) Lille not only has a Christmas Market but every street is decorated, the lights being switched on as soon as darkness falls which in winter is around 4 p.m. The town is therefore a feast for the eyes.

Because of the proximity of the U.K. and because the town is a 'border town', trains arriving at the two railroad station from France, Luxemburg, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, and indeed from London too, the locals speak the universal language of English, or they try to.

On my Dec 1 visit to the town, I found only one thing extremely upsetting: the beggars. There is a beggar every 50 or so meters along most of the streets. It can be a man - young, not so young, and even old - a man with toddlers, or a woman with toddlers, or a woman on her own, one who is also not young anymore. They sit or lie on the road and sidewalks on cardboard, some of them in a praying position. One cannot give to each beggar.","Written December 2, 2017"

The streets were quite scruffy, with lots of litter around. We didn't think there were that many nice shops. Admittedly it was a Sunday so lots of places were closed, we know shops don't open in France on Sunday's. We didn't feel particularly safe. There were a couple of Police cars, but no policemen!

We visited the chapel of the dukes of Burgundy and were shown what the adjacent palace must have looked like before it was gutted by fire.

Next up were the Grand Place with the statue of the deity, the beautiful Vieille Bourse, the House of the Royal Guard and the austere Voix du Nord.

The pavements were all a mess and we had to negotiate plastic ramps covering ditches every few seconds. The space on the pavements is reduced by the clutter of barriers, there are only a few places to cross the road and some roads are completely blocked, even to pedestrians. As a result, it is impossible to see and admire many of the buildings.

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,The ‚ÄúSupervisor‚Äù Named David was the Worst Disney Cast Member I‚Äôve ever Encountered,"My family goes to Disney World at least once a year, and it is truly one of our favorite places in the world. The general attitudes and helpfulness of the cast members have always been second to none. Well, that is until our most recent trip when we attempted to ride Ratatouille. After getting in the virtual que at exactly 7:00, we had an estimated ride time of 12:40. That time was pushed back throughout the day until our boarding group was called at 4:50. We walked to the entrance and we‚Äôre turned away because a cast member claimed her face covering wasn‚Äôt adequate. It was a standard cloth face mask that she had used the previously 3 days without issue. The cast member refused entry until we got a disposable face mask. I walked back to our stroller and returned promptly. During the brief time that I was gone, the same cast member allowed my party entry, including my daughter who allegedly had an inadequate face covering. When I attempted to enter I was stopped by a man in a red shirt named David who refused my entry. He said that the ride was down and I could not enter. I explained the situation with the other cast member, and he again directed me to leave. I reiterated that the rest of my group, including my wife and kids, were in the ride and I was either going to join them, or if they were going to be asked to leave, wait for them at the front. He told me I could not wait there, despite the fact that I was surrounded by several other people who were doing just that. When I told him that I had no intention of leaving without my party and was not going to move until I saw that everyone else was also being asked to move, David threatened to call security on me. I asked for the name of David‚Äôs supervisor, and David said that he was the supervisor. I explained that I knew he had a supervisor, and I wanted his name. David stated that his supervisor was in the ride attempting to address the issue. I explained that I had no desire to talk to him immediately, but I did want to talk to him and report how I had been treated by David. David told me that he was not going to give me the name of his supervisor. I left, and my group was not released. I was later able to get together with them through the assistance of another cast member, but that in no way made up for the unnecessary trouble created by David.","Written November 22, 2021"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Not Enough Facilities,"Visited in November 2021 with my partner, we assumed it would be fairly quiet as it was during the school holidays and low season for Disneyland.
We had been monitoring queue times on the app before we visited but thought it was just busy due to the Halloween celebrations but this park just doesn't seem to die down.
There are only really five big rides - Crush's Coaster, Tower of Terror, RC Racer, Ratatouille and Cars Road Trip. There are a couple of other attractions but nothing big and mainly aimed at small children, I've yet to see Crush's Coaster go under 60 minutes of wait time.
We decided on day 2 to get up for park opening and head straight to studios in a bid to beat the queue but even by 9:45 the queue for Crush was 135 minutes. We actually went on the Ratatouille ride, RC racer and then left the park as by that point everything averaged 80/90 minutes or above.
The park is great but there is nowhere near enough rides for the amount of people visiting, hopefully will be better once new attractions open next year.","Written November 14, 2021"

Too bad the closed RockNRollercoaster ... I sure miss that.
The Tower of Terror is just great and the park is also not bad if you consider about the size.
To bad it is only a park for a few hours and the new Toy Story land is a bit of a line generator... the attractions are very short and have a low capacity, so not always worth the wait.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,"great park, but some longer queues","What more can you can vs what others haven't! You could look and pick faults; rides not all working, no fireworks or parades due to Covid in 2021 (and long queues for things like covid pass), pretty expensive - both getting in and things inside; shops food, etc.
But for kids (both small and grown up!) its a great experience - with some great rides, but queues longer here than at the disneyland park so we had a give up a couple","Written October 27, 2021"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Queues too long and not enough there,"There are many issues currently with the Walt Disney Studios. This is mainly because they are doing a lot of construction work. Because of this, there are a very small number of rides available, all of which are geared for much older ages generally, and have extremely long queue times almost all of the day.

Also, in addition to the construction work, the quality of some rides is not as good, for example the relocation of the Studio Tram Tour to become the Cars Road Trip, as it is now much shorter and there is less to see. In addition to the shorter hours it's quite hard to spend a day at this park so it's more of a halfday thing for people who enjoy thrilling rides - it doesn't really cater for families with younger children.

But with all this said, once the shows return too it will be much better I'm sure, and of course the enjoyment of some rides etc. is still there!","Written October 21, 2021"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Don‚Äôt go at the moment,"The first problem about this attraction is the lack of information on their website about what is on and open at the park at the moment. It advertises shows and restaurants. No map that I could find. The information was poor when we got there as well. Many restaurants, shops and shows are closed. When I complained at the information centre it was pointed at that the shows, were actually ‚Äòselfie‚Äô opportunities with characters. I think the only show I could see was Stitch. I was told that the problem was COVID. If that is the case then be honest and explain this fully on the website and do not try to disguise the reduced entertainment and do NOT CHARGE full price. Please Disney if you read this don‚Äôt reply with a standard comment and ‚Äòwelcome me back‚Äô. Give me a partial refund. It is a rip off.","Written October 16, 2021"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Improvements Can Be Made,"This park has quite a few good rides, but as said many times before, it is generally lacking in overarching theming. Though some of the areas are themed quite well (e.g. Toy Story Land, Ratatouille), outside of these areas, the theme appears to be ""Concrete"". Though I understand that large changes are coming in the next few years, and I have no doubt that they will improve the park greatly, for now, I think it is possibly the lowest ranking Disney park for me. My feedback would be to rebrand it and get rid of the studio theming, as it doesn't quite work in Paris. Maybe change it to. just ""Walt Disney Park"", and then do some retheming. It could probably even be done before the new areas open. Looking forward to visiting after the expansions to maybe make a new review. Thanks!","Written October 13, 2021"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Average,"Unfortunately, as someone who isn't into the big rides, this park isn't so good for me. The thing I usually really enjoy about Disney is all the theming and magic that they create even without needing the big rides. This is more about the big rides without the magic. I think the Disney theming that sets Disney apart from other theme parks needs some improvement here. The rides are good I'm told, but the magic isn't there.","Written September 17, 2021"

One annoying thing about those taxi rides in the park, yesterday 24th July between 12& 2 the lady driver of fire department car ride was the queen of rudeness, tried several times to get the kids on the ride but seems she was not in the mood of driving.

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,"Good park, but not much to do!","The only reason we went to this park was for a few of the rides and a few of the new social distanced meet and greets. Ratatouille was the best ride of the day. We didn't go on Crush's Coaster, as when we arrived, in extra magic time, it was already at 40 minutes. The wait even went up to 70 during the day before settling at 50 before closing time. The new social distanced meet and greets are fabulous. The Marvel meet and greet was my favourite as I got to meet Loki, who is the best! The characters change every half an hour. So for example, at 11:00, it would be Thor, Loki, Black Widow and Spider-Man. At 11:30, it would be Captain America, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange and Black Panther. It was such a fun meet. Another great thing to do was the new Frozen meet and greet selfie spots. Though you have to pre-book that through Lineberty... It was SO hard to get a booking, I was refreshing constantly with three phones. I really dislike lineberty as I don't think it's fair. All the meets apart from Marvel and Mickey and the Magician characters were lineberty I believe. When this park gets the new Frozen land, it will be really cool. Though for now, you can't spend a whole day here.","Written September 18, 2020"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Disneyland paris season of the force,"We went to Disneyland for the Star Wars season of the force. It was a great interactive experience which immersed you in it. The season of the force features shows, exclusive character meet and greets and fun times for all the family.

There was plenty of detail put into each experience to make it more immersive and interactive.One of these experiences was the first order March which featured storm troopers and Captain Fasma marching. No more no less. The meet and greet with storm troopers that you‚Äôd find in studio square and with Ray and Chewbacca Were all fun and a thrilling memorable experience. The characters fitted their roles perfectly in the first order recruitment experience which in my opinion is the best out of all of them. you‚Äôd be recruited by Kylo Ren which although sounds quite basic is very very thrilling. He really gets in your face and the girls all get the giggles when they are recruited. Just remember to dress up in Star Wars clothing then you will have a better chance to be chosen to go on stage. The nighttime show was beautiful, thrilling and epic to see.

Although I really enjoyed it and it was a great immersive experience there were some general grievances I had. When I went I expected a little more maybe a vehicle from Star Wars. The character meeting greets were great but I don‚Äôt think they were the best characters to choose for example you had a ray there but I would have preferred Bubba Fett or Skywalker. A few droids would‚Äôve made the experience way better. The nighttime show was well-made and awesome to see but the point of it was slightly confusing and the parts of the show where characters actually came out on stage was a little disappointing for example C-3PO and R2-D2 literally come up and then they go down on the platform. Why make the characters costumes if you‚Äôre not going to use the costumes interactively?

So in conclusion it was a great fun experience definitely worth seeing. It‚Äôs got potential to be better but it‚Äôs still very good.",

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,"First Disney Experience, impacted by ride failures/closures","Visited as a group including three children aged under 12 for their first Disney experience - had a Two Park Multi-Day Pass. Being at any Disney Park is great, although we found that many of the rides and attractions experienced failures and some were also totally closed (including a high volume of eating locations). Fast Pass was not always available, and some queues in particular were simply too long for little ones to wait. Even using Magic Hours (from staying at a Disney property), it was very difficult to fully immerse ourselves in the Park and all it had to offer.

Luckily, as we had spread our visit across a number of days, we managed to tick off most rides and attractions, but sadly, still left with some to do. Hopefully we will be able to return and experience the full Park again in the future.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Enjoyed this more than the main park,We had a joint pass to go here and the main park. I know its newer and I know that its on a different theme but I felt they had got this park just right and was a better experience than the main Park. Its absolutely worth getting tickets for both parks. Don't bother with the LineBuddy App... completely useless and sold out within 30 seconds. It's not what it's cracked up to be.,"Written March 29, 2020"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,It can improve,I definitely enjoyed my visit in Disneyland park more than Disney studios. This park can get a lot of improvement but this is something the Disney team already knows since they're planning a massive enlargement of the park with new attractions. I'm sure that in the next years it will become as beautiful and interesting as Disney park,"Written March 25, 2020"

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Disappointing,"The Disney parks in France just don't compare to the Disney parks in the US and Japan (I've been to all of them). First, this parks is significantly smaller than the Disney Studio's in Florida and doesn't have the same selection of rides/shows. The lines are long and the staff doesn't match the expectations set by Disney staff in other parts of the world. They do a poor job at line management (especially the Frozen show).

Line cutting is apparently a ""thing"" at Disney Europe and the Disney staff don't care.

On the plus side they do a great job with multiple languages. The Ratatouille ride and Crushes Coaster are a lot of fun

In summary, this isn't bad, but for the Price and Disney band, I'd expect this to match Disney parks in other parts of the world. There's so much to do in this part of Europe, there are better uses of time and money","Written March 8, 2020"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Do it for the kids,"Review is the average opinion of a family of 5. I would give it 1 as the queues are too long and fast pass is difficult in such a big park. Everything is a rip off as expected. My four year old queued a regular 40 minutes for very basic rides and the park could quite easily double smaller children‚Äôs rides for a cost as the space is there and would improve everyone‚Äôs experience.
Saying that my 5 year old & 8 year old both gave it 5/5 so what do I know haha it‚Äôs all about them. This side was my enjoyable for younger children than Disneyland side.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Its OK,"I am a huge Disney fan so it doesn't take much to impress me but to be honest I found this side of Disneyland a bit average. I like the look of the park... the entry is quite impressive with the fountain and indoor park (also a good option in winter when the weather can be hit and miss) and the general theming of the park is good. However it is much smaller than the other Disneyland park and felt very cramped in places. The ride wait times were also very long during our visit which was in the school holidays.
They had a Star Wars event on when we were there which meant you could buy themed food, there was a parade and daytime shows and an evening show with fireworks etc. These were all fun but again no comparison to the other park.
I hear they are looking to expand this park which may bring improvement
I don't think I would go Disneyland purely for this park but if you have multi park passes it is worth dropping in.","Written March 1, 2020"

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Very Cool Smaller Park,"We were in Disney for 2 days and decided to do this park first because of high winds. Because it's smaller, you're able to go on every ride you want to as well as see some shows. It also has a cool ""behind the scenes feel"" but isn't as magical as the main park. They have best information though on different types of animation and you can even sit in on a tutorial to draw a Disney character. We got Mickey! Overall, a fun park.","Written February 24, 2020"

It was a great show and it also gave us an excuse to sit for a while I‚Äôm the air conditioning (it was a humid 32 degrees outside!) There were plenty of options for things to eat and nice grassy areas to sit, and there were shops and souvenirs that the Disneyland Paris side of the park didn‚Äôt have.

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Not enough to do,Our family are huge fans of Disney. The problem with this park is there are simply not enough attractions to justify a day trip and therefore the ticket price. It is a shame as some things are lovely - the Ratatouille area is themed well and the variety of good and drink stalls is good. If you go on a hopper ticket then fine but I would not recommend paying for this park in isolation - it is nowhere near as good as the Florida park.,"Written February 2, 2020"

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Not much happening at this park!,"Very surprised at the lack of rides and what appeared to me to be poor replacements for shows or rides that have been replaced.

Example was the studio backlot tour...its shorter than normal and takes in a building site! No costume department and when you get to the part where London is trashed by a dragon, no dragon, just the odd ball of flame.

The Frozen stage show looked like it was cobbled together too, and part of the park was closed.

And then we had the issue of using the fast food restaurant at the entrance. One 'Cast Member' shouting at us for sitting down at a table, taking our coats off and me getting the family order (seven of us).

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Very cool...,"This park creates a total different atmosphere to the main park, but still just as fun. When you walk into the main building of the park it is like you are walking onto different sets which is quite cool. The downside to the park is that there aren't a lot of rides to do and if you want to meet Woody or Minnie, you have to book a specific slot. We did not know this and as a result couldn't get a photograph or a signature from them. If you have a small child it is advisable to book a slot way in advance to make sure you get to meet them, especially if you have limited time. The staff surrounding these characters were also very rude as they had an issue with us taking photo of Woody from a distance. The show called Mickey's Christmas band was awesome, a definite must for anyone visiting Walt Disney studios. The other show (Merry Jolly Jingles), was a total downer and I wouldn't waste my time there, rather go on the rides that is there. We kept on missing the show at the outside theater as we couldn't get the times when it started... There's this little mobile cart that sells Mickey waffles - If you have a sweet tooth, you definitely have to try one...",

For young kids there are only maybe 5 rides at most flying carpets, cars, slinky dog, ratatouille, stitch live and the 2 shows frozen and motors! Other rides open are tv racer, tower of terror, parachute drop and crush‚Äôs coaster! Due to their only being a handful of rides even at quiet times queues are so so bad. Use fast passes!

Now with the removal of Armageddon and Rock n' Roller coaster.. it's gotten worse.

Not to mention we arrived when Crush's Coaster and several other attractions were closed for a refit.. it's even worse value for money.

We visited this time with a toddler who seemed delighted with the Toy Story land especially but again, barring Ratatouille - there isn't enough to keep people in the area.

The worst part - the character meet and greets but of a cracking business perspective, a genius idea to move Minnie into the Studios Park because of course, if your child wants to see Minnie.. you'll have to pay extra to come to the Studios.

Speaking of the meet and greets.. you'll need to be downloading and installing the LineBerty app because of course, you need an appointment to see the premium level characters ie: Minnie, Buzz and Woody for example.

It took us ALL DAY to get a Minnie Mouse ticket through the app and you need to be rapid to get hold of one when they come up (just a quick tip) but once we met her - it made our daughters whole holiday in one fell swoop.

I see they are pushing the new fastpasses and I in essence would like to see a premium pass for character meets because it would make things a lot simpler in the long run as well as being another revenue stream for Disney to explore and to give people further choice as a time saver.",

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Wonderful,"We absolutely enjoyed the Mickey show, amazing bilingual show. It feels like your on a movie set. You have to go at least 45 minutes before the show start time to stand in line as the queues are very long.","Written November 6, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,So small but unique,"Walt Disney Studio is so tiny but after a day at Disneyland it was a fun experience. Ratatouille was so cute and well done. The free moving cars without the track made for a unique ride experience.

The studio tour was weak but was ok for the last ride of the day. After experiencing the Universal Studio Tram tour I guess my expectations are higher. Come on Disney, you're definitely better than this.

Walking around was relaxing though. definitely not a rush at all.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Great place,Kids loved the ratatouille ride it was awesome. The toy story area was brilliant in fact all the place is a great experience.,"Written November 4, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Looking forward to the improvements,"Visited the park over Halloween, however, there was no Halloween theming in this park at all, only in the main park. We spent two half days in this park and managed to get everything done. The park has limited rides and attractions and some are currently shut down for refurbishment. I know the park is majorly expanding over the next few years so I look forward to seeing the end result.

Crush‚Äôs coaster was by far the best ride in the park, and the wait time reflected this. We went here as soon as the park opened and the wait time was already 70 minutes. I feel this attraction would majorly benefit from a fast pass option. Wait times apart from this ride were relatively short and we used fast pass for Ratatouille. This was a very impressive dark ride for adults as well as children. Would definitely watch Moteurs, Action stunt show, great for all the family.

I feel there was limited quick service restaurants in the park which meant long queues and difficulties getting a table in those that were open. I hope this is improved when the park is expanded.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Great for a day,"This is a much smaller park than Disneyland and when a couple of attractions are closed there is a lot less to do. Having said that there is a lot of time spent in the lines. Crush‚Äôs Coaster, Ratatouille (exceptional) and Hollywood Tower are the highlights not to be missed and Chez Remy is a dining experience, very clever decor, great staff and delicious food. There is limited shopping in this park and it closes much earlier than Disneyland. 1 day is plenty.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,"Significantly worse since last visit, desperately in need of new rides",,
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Excellent day in this park,We spent a good portion of the day in this park. Queues were smaller than in the main park (plus even smaller at lunch time) and most rides are for the family. The Studio Tram Tour is a must see!,
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Perfect,"Others have said they are small and not that great. We had a great time. It was a slow weekend, which we loved. We were able to ride everything multiple times. The restaurants were good, the Disneyland Hotel was perfect! We loved the cast members everywhere. The studios park was in between special events so that was sad.","Written October 30, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Excellent park,"I visited with my partner, 5 year old daughter & 8month old daughter. We only spent one day in the studios & I would say if planned correctly this is ample time as it is smaller than the main park. There are plenty of family friendly rides with the studios tour being a favourite this was an excellent experience. The ratatouille ride is also excellent but would recommend using fast passes. There is a large toy story section & some bigger rides. A small choice of restaurants compared with the main park but a good day.","Written October 29, 2019"

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Good But a bit over priced,"we visited the studios park on the 17th of December.
The ques where way too long but we did get into some amazing rides and really enjoyed it. The coffees and food are too expensive.
But if you visit take the airosmith ride and the how the magic begins.
those the two ones I like the most!",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,"Good, but ..","We had a great time and it is a fantastic experience, but it was expensive to eat and drink in the park. I did expect it but the food options on offer were very expensive (8 euros for a hot-dog) and very limited if you have any type of food allergy.

Take a princess dress in with you if you have a little girl, as all of the girls wear them in there and they cost a lot more there than at home.","Written October 28, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Enjoyed the unique attractions,"We visited for one day, using a hopper pass for both this park and Disneyland. This park probably isn't big enough to completely fill a day, so we were fine with the shared pass. We focused on the attractions that are unique to this park, especially Ratatouille and Crush's Coaster. Both had long lines, but Rataouille has a fast pass and we appreciate the chance to experience these rides which don't exist at Disneyland in California. We also enjoyed the food - walkup booths that serve specialities from regions of France and from other European countries. The mix of French and English in the park was also fascinating. We weren't sure about a trip here, but our teenagers really wanted to go, and both they and the adults had a great day.","Written October 27, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,"Overpriced, terrible like the main park","Absolutely the worst theme park 1- 2 hour ques so you have to buy a fast pass ticket costing you 100 euros aprx per day per person!! Basic cheap hot dog 8 euros!! No characters walking around either Park, no good for kids, seems disney is now designed to take as much cash as possible, with crazy over top prices, and not bother to make it special for the kids or family, a simple character dressed up would of been nice, you have to book online to get a phito with a character! Ermm I sure Evryone knows to do this before seeing off to disney don't they?? Don't think so. 30min queuing at a what seemed a harsh security check In gate, similar to a airport busy security customs, I think security is good, but come on disney why 30min hold up, surely by know extra gates and staff could be applied to speed up things, be prepared for long ques at evry event ride, you need to spend big cash for fast passes to even get on a few per day, delays and ques at food stops all day, I think there are far better parks in the UK. Disney your park is overrated, and a overchageing joke which is a big shame, my kids were disappointed with your park, and other disneyland park, when you are meant to be a family orientated company, it's a discrace, I wander how many other family's get caught out having to buy fast passes at aprx 100 euros per day per child, ends up being extra 200 or 500 etc euros on holliday if you want a chance of getting on ride, I think more greedy prices by Disney!! I'd rather eat a bowl of wasps than go to your parks again or recomend you to any friends. Never again","Written October 27, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Great it worth,"Shows were great.
Games was entertaining.
Again long queue needs solution.
They are the creator of entertainment",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Used to be better...probably will improve!,I am a huge fan of this place but hadn‚Äôt visited since 2016. I was sorry to see so many things closed with nothing in their place but apparently 2020 will be the year the new rides or shows open. So sad there was no more Mickey & the Magician show which was a real highlight in the past. The whole theatre is shut as is the Disney Jnr event and there is basically no longer any production to watch having earned a few quiet moments off your feet! The Rock n Roller Coaster is also gone. The studios felt somewhat depleted though Crush‚Äôs Coaster ans Ratatouille are still stand out rides. Alas the whole Magic Hours is a bit of a con as most major rides were inexplicably shut or ‚Äúnot yet available‚Äù until after 10am and fast pass doesn‚Äôt open until 10am either...so a good way to convince you a stay in a Disney hotel comes with this perk but it was a bit of a let down three days in a row for us. Maybe hold off until 2020...,"Written November 1, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,"Fantastic, but plan to be beat the queues!","This is pronounced as the second park, but actually this offers a completely different type of fun, but with the Disney feel throughout.

This park takes you on a tour of all things film.

The favourite ride for us was definitely the 4d Ratatouille themed simulator which is simply an outstanding exhibition of fun, surprise, and all things Disney. This ride has Fast Pass so don‚Äôt worry about the queues if you have this. You must go on it with all your young and old family. Brilliant.

There is a section for Toy Story with relevant themed rides, and also the opportunity to meet both Buzz and Woody (Please not you have to download an app to achieve this, and you literally have to log on immediately to stand any chance of getting a booking to see them, but if you plan this then you can easily meet them - we did both times we logged on).

There is an amazing stunt show that is on twice a day and is highly recommended to watch it, as it the tram that shows you how various stunts are performed. You must do both these but think about when as whilst these operate Its a great time to beat the queues on other rides!

There are two rides which offers fun for thrill-seekers. The Tower of Terrors, which operates 3 different lift rides that go up and down at fast pace, and available with Fast Pass.... but the very fun Finding Nimmo themed ride called Crush‚Äôs Coaster is the most popular but has no Fast Pass, and everyone who get there early will go straight to this ride as it‚Äôs available to all then - so do expect very long queues for this one! Be warned.

Food is difficult to get (limited options and large queues), so take a packed lunch and drinks, and it gets very busy, so just make sure you‚Äôve planned for this. The park is always clean and there is just about enough toilets too.

You can complete the whole park in a day, including all the shows too, but make sure you know what you‚Äôre doing before you get there.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,"Smaller, hence even more crowded","Amazing Disney Park, but the huge crowd and the long queues are a total turn off. Our pass included both the park and the studios. The park is larger offers more ride but the studio has more shows. The Avengers show was amazing and not to forget the Tower of Terror, although it took us more than an hour each in the queue to enter the shows.","Written October 26, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Great second park,Visited as part of our trip to Disneyland Paris. Great park loads to do. HollywoodTower of terror is amazing.,
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Long queues and mostly closed. AVOID,"Totally disappointing experience of Walt Disney studios. Packed, extremity long queues with lots of closed attractions. Obviously now trying to get you to pay more for their new fast pass system. Also a lack of shows.
Don‚Äôt bother!","Written October 23, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Quite quiet. Loads closed.,"This is by far the poorer of the two parks and much smaller. It currently is undergoing work so a big section is closed off (avengers hq being built).

Great rides like house of terror, crushers coaster, ratatouille, slinky dog and racer and the lineaberty app works well for character meets. However there is a serious lack of fast pass options and a serious lack of photo pass on the rides.

Worth a visit but only as a park hopper, I wouldn‚Äôt go for a full day.

Potentially it‚Äôll be great in the future.

Ps parachute drop was so frustrating. Waited in line a few times but it always broke down","Written October 21, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,"Still great, but a lot of construction","A year after our last visit, it's clear there is a lot of construction and this impacts on the enjoyment and convenience of the park.
There's still a lot to do, but sadly the general Disneyland Paris lack of organisation/efficiency causes issues - queue times inaccurate, fastpass is what Florida had in the 90s (paper tickets, rather than a worthwhile app), and rides seems to inconsistently open for extra magic hours without any real publication.
Staff were really slow to turnover some rides - Cars was the worst, took longer to unload and load the vehicles than the actual ride lasts.","Written October 21, 2019"

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Worth giving it ago !!!,"Great rides for all ages, with lots going on, usually slightly less busier than the other park, but just as good.
The children like the slinky dog ride in the children‚Äôs area.
Lots of areas to sit down and have a rest,drink or eat.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Waiting for the magic,"I‚Äôve always been a little underwhelmed by this park (compared to the original, which I‚Äôve always loved). Now with seasonal closures & swathes being cleared for future expansion, there‚Äôs really not a lot to be fussed by. We all hope it will become great with future Marvel, Star Wars & Frozen lands, but for now... so meh.
Armageddon was always pants. The Cars ride is disappointing. The carpets on the flying carpet ride are either broken or the paint all scratched to hell. The choice of food (excluding some interesting street vendors) is pretty poor.
Ratatouille is great if you manage to get a Fast Pass and don‚Äôt suffer motion sickness. Tower of Terror isn‚Äôt my thing. The Backlot Tram has one excellent moment but a LOT of padding.
Here‚Äôs to future greatness...","Written October 13, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,To many things closed,Soooo I love this park and in the past it was my favourite. However to many of the shows etc were not open. Half the park is closed as building avengers rides. We did the park in half a day. I wouldn‚Äôt of been happy to of paid full cost to get in. Buzz light year meet and greet goes within seconds on the app which isn‚Äôt great. They need to re open all the shows etc to make this park amazing again!,"Written October 13, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Pleasant suprise,"After having been to the other parc the day before, this Parc was surprisingly nice as well. Decor is well thought through. The stunt show was especially spectacular.","Written October 11, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Studios was my favourite 10 years ago!,"Walt Disney Studios was my favourite park 10 years ago when I last visited as a kid, however now I find the park now to be quite poor in comparison. The only real reason we visited was to ride the Tower of Terror which was excellent and to see Stitch live! We made the mistake of not using extra magic time for this park and missed out on riding on the Crush ride. The ratatouille ride is excellent and there are quite a few places to grab some quick food. The tram ride is worth doing especially if you haven't done it before.

The park feels quite claustrophobic as it is smaller and quite a bit is corned off/closed for refurb, so there are a lot of people in a smaller area.

It is a shame the rock and rollercoaster is now closed, would have loved to go on that again but unfortunately was not able to visit before closure.","Written October 7, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,"Very fun, but only 4 (out of 9 attractions) are attractive to adults","The place is pure magic and the level of detail is amazing. The park opens at 10 and closes at 20. You can complete the whole park in less than 8 hours.

Although the park has 9 main attractions + meet and greets, for adults (I am 39)
the must-visit attractions are 4:

1. Twilight zone tower of terror (has fast pass)
2. Crush & Coaster
3. RC Racer
4. Ratatouille (has fast pass)

Bonus:
- Lilo and Stitch interactive show. It think it was a fun interaction between the video, the presenter and the audience (mostly families with their kids)
- The Studio Tram tour with the special effects canyon and a devastated city. It was fun to take pictures of the special effects.

The remaining attractions are nice, but nothing that i haven't seen in other parks, considering the ticket's price.

TIP: Fast pass
I recommend using the Fast pass (THAT IS FREE). It gives you a 30 minutes time frame to go through a special line with almost no waiting time. Certain attractions support it. Do not confuse with the Super / ultimate Fast pass, which is paid). I recommend going to the attractions supporting fast pass as first activity when entering the park and then go to a ride that doesn't support it.

Fast pass rules: You can get another fast pass after 2 hours OR when the 30 minutes time frame of your current fastpass starts.
For example, go to twilight zone and get the fast pass. It will give you a time frame to go to the fastpass line. In the meantime, go to Crush and Coaster ride. if 2 hours have passed since you got the fastpass for the twilight zone (or you are in the timeframe of 30 minutes to enter the Twilight zone), get a fastpass for Ratatouille.

Meet and Greet with Toy Story Characters
If you want to have a meet and greet with the characters, you must book them through Lineberty app. I didn't knew about this and everything was booked for the day.

Eating at the park
This park had a lot of regional cuisine from different countries and the lines weren't that long. I prefer this park over Disneyland, as options to eat are numerous, while at Disneyland you will only find hot dogs / starbucks alike coffees or Restaurant lines always crowded. Warning: prices are not cheap. 14 euros a DESSERT PLATE SIZE German food (coleslaw, 1 tiny piece of sausage, a thumb size potato and a tiny pork piece of meat) with 1 glass of beer.

TIP: If you are at Disneyland park and have a both parks ticket, i recommend going to Walt Disney Studios to have a meal. It will be less crowded and there are numerous food trucks.","Written October 7, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Brilliant - Amazing shows,"We (6 adults & 2 children) spent 4 days in Disneyland Paris and probably spent just over a full day in Studios.

I was really surprised by how great I thought this park was, there is a lot of work going on at the moment, however it was still brilliant and plenty to do.

There‚Äôs not a lot of ‚Äòbig‚Äô rides so be prepared to queue, while we there I didn‚Äôt see the queue for Crush, Ratatouille or Tower of Terror drop below an hour. Although if you haven‚Äôt been on them I would say it‚Äôs worth the wait.

My big tip for this park is don‚Äôt miss the shows, they are all brilliant in there own way.
Micky and the Magician, felt like a west end production
The stunt show is amazing
stitch live is hilarious.

Other tips
- If you can use fast pass for Ratatouille and be prepared to queue for Crush (it doesn‚Äôt have fast pass)
- Don‚Äôt forget all meets are done via ‚ÄòLineberty‚Äô, an app for your phone - this worked well for us, however Buzz was fully booked within seconds.
- if the food stalls are there, buy food from there - the paella I had was delicious
- Don‚Äôt miss ratatouille - the whole section of the park is so well done.
- The tram ride is well worth a go.

All in all I really liked this park, I think the shows make it for me, they were all just amazing.

I would definitely recommend spending a day at this park and not overlooking it.","Written October 6, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Good but prefer the main park,"For us, there was never much to do in the studios. Lineberty is the absolute devil and made meet and greets virtually impossible, so that lets the studios down a lot. The only saving grace is Bistro Chez Remy, Crush's Coaster and my son loves the slinky dog and magic carpets. I do like the food carts dotted around. I just don't spend so much time in this part of the park as it's very lackluster.","Written October 6, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Better than the park.,"I will start by getting the obvious negatives out the way. Queued at least an hour for each of the better rides. Drinks 5Euros a pop and a lot of walking.

If you take those out though the studio is miles ahead of the Park. All the best rides are here. If you only go on one, it HAS TO BE!!!!! the Tower of Terror. Absolutely amazing ride. Our 7 year old son wasn't sure at first but as soon as it started he was yeeha'ing his head off and wanted to go straight back into the queue. Big shout to the 2 ""bellhops"" that welcome you onto the ride itself. The first one was hilarious. The second 1 was a ""miserable"" sod but was just the part she was playing. I was talking and I was told in no uncertain terms to shut my face. Really liked being fired right to the top of the Tower only for it to come to a shuddering halt and the doors opening. You could see all over the park before the doors shut and the terror starts all over again.Also really like the Thunder Mountain rollercoaster.

Would also really recommend the Tram tour of the studios.","Written October 5, 2019"

We spent the first day at the wonderful Disneyland park. The second day we went to Walt Disney Studios Park. We were disappointed as it's nothing to compare with the other park. The rides/attractions are much fewer. Waiting time was way longer. Several ones were shut or under renovation. We only spent around four hours and decided to get into the other park one more time.,"Written October 5, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Best part of Disney,"We spent a whole day here last year while visiting Disneyland, my son loved meeting the characters even if we did have to queue nearly two hours to see them.

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Dated park,"This park only really has 2 rides of interest to adults and teenagers- tower of terror and crush‚Äôs coaster. Both had huge wait times around 2 hours.
Toy Story land is hardly a land, there is no play area for kids just 3 rides one of which my kids were not tall enough to ride.
The tram tour is so old and dated, it has not been updated since I last rode it in 2002 referencing films such as Pearl Harbour and Dinotopia! Hardly relevant.

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Ok. But very expensive for what it is.,"Nice parks. Yet 2 days is not enough. You need at least 3/4 days to do all the rides and attractions. Lots of rides were closed down. We went on a weekend. Queues were very very very very long. Rides were very very very short. It would be nice to restrict the amount of people going in. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a health and safety issues re overcrowding. My son loved it. Which was the main point. We waited till 8pm to see the fireworks. But only found out much later it didn‚Äôt start till 10pm. My 5 year old son who was looking forward to it all day he fell asleep in our arms at 9pm. So we went home. It would be nice if they could tell people or put signs up or the staff could inform us. Even putting up a hand written note somewhere would be helpful. I found the staff very rude. Gave me wrong directions several times. They work there and don‚Äôt have a clue.
Cost us over ¬£25 for a fish burger / chips and some chicken nuggets / chips. Food was terrible. Big queues to buy the food. They must be the richest company in the world. I must buy shares in them. Not enough water points.

Queues up for over an hour to see mickey magic show. It lasted for about 25 mins. Was good. But note you spend majority of your time in queues. I wasn‚Äôt going to dirks nearly ¬£300 for fast passes as my son wouldn‚Äôt have been able to go on any of the rides.
Specially seeing that we nearly spent ¬£600 for 2 days for the 2 parks just for entry tickets. For 3 people.

Best to do one park one day and studios next day when time is short as studios is a bit smaller. But don‚Äôt understand why you can‚Äôt go into both parks for one same price. A bit of a scam if you asked me.

My son loved the Buffalo Bill Wild West show. But then again ¬£70 per person ain‚Äôt cheap.

They had races over the weekend in the park. A bit stupid while the park was open. As had to keep queuing just to cross the roads all the time. Very annoying. Why can‚Äôt they close the park if they want to hold a race through the park. Also they didn‚Äôt advertise that on the website when I bought tickets otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have gone last weekend.

All in all. Make sure you can afford it before you go or get a bank loan out first.

Will go back but need to save up again which will take me 10 years.

3) Place de remy - out of this world - Disney has an incredible ability to transport you to new places and (as a lover of rataouille) I felt transported to paris.

4) Stunt show - a must see. I wasn't expecting much but the 40 minute show flew by and must have been watched by 5000 people. Loved it!

5) Food trucks - arguably the best food (outside of the big restaurants) is in the trucks. I loved the belgian sausage and chips for 7 euros which was a great lunch

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,re visit from a few years ago,"We stayed at a disney hotel used magic hours to get entry into Walt disney studios before the public would enter the park. I definetly would recommend using this option if available. We headed straight to tower of terror noticed a lot of guests were going in the oposite directions.

We later realised they were heading straight towards crush coaster ride.
Crush coaster gets very long que lengths stangely no fast pass available on this ride.There is a single ride que but not a lot of time difference if the que is long as its a 4 person ride and very few families of 3.

Id recommed heading straight to crush coaster as tower of terror offers fast pass.

We loved the mickey and the magician show definetly a must if visiting.Recommend getting there 30 mins before show as gets very busy.

Ratatouille ride was good we used fastpass didnt feel was worth queing for.

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,"Ratatouille, Food and Wine Equivalent in early September","To be fair a lot was under construction when we went in early September, but it did not bother us. They were redoing Cars Land, Rockin Roller Coast and another section. We have never been but have been to both USA based parks. We loved Chez Remy and Ratatouille (main reason we went). The atmosphere is awesome, the park felt less crowded than the USA ones. The Epicurean from surrounding countries and provinces in France , is sort of like the Food and Wine or the Christmas tastings around Epcot. I got a glass of wine and walked around which was nice. The intimacy of the park, you could really do it all in one day. The longest lines were maybe 60 minutes, they do have single rider lines but they can be a wait as well. I would go back, but for us it's only really a half day, a few hours a day park as we don't do all the rides.","Written September 12, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Superb & exciting,"This park has got the most thrilling rides and one of my favourite ones is Crush rider which I have not taken at any other park.

The tower of terror is always accelerating and the attendant Laurent was so good that he did set the seen of horror and terror.

Given an option if the kids are aged 7 plus one should just do this park.

Awesome fun.","Written September 12, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,A little disappointed,,"Written September 12, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Great day out,"Rides were great, stunt how was excellent
As was the tower of terror!!!
Crush coaster was closed so kids were disappointed
Ratatouille was better than I expected too and the kids loved this.
Do the single rider on these types of rides where kids can sit on their own, outs were old enough and literally in the next car, but no queues at all for single riders so saved loads of time here.
The hot wheels ride was overrated but the boys insisted on queuing and waiting well over an hour. Lovely park, food is very samey in ever restaurant so don‚Äôt expect much variety
Would visit again, a full day is not needed","Written September 11, 2019"

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Long lineups,"If it's your first time, keep in mind that there are less rides in the studios than in the parcs so lineups are longer. The rides that have Fast pass are easier. Opt for single riders when you dont have young kids, it would cut your waiting time by half or more. Ratatouille is still amazing, tower of terror is too scary for the young kids (even adults üòä), the rest are all nice.","Written September 7, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,A+,"Went to the Studios on my second ‚Äúexploring Disneyland park‚Äù day. One day is more than enough to see everything and go on some rides.
Not all of them have the ‚Äúpriority‚Äù tickets options and some rides were closed during my visit. However I still had the best time ever! Loved the space and the attractions. Would recommend 100% to go and try the Stich live show as it‚Äôs engaging and entertaining, not only for kids but for adults as well!!
Loved the ‚ÄúChef Remi‚Äù ride but didn‚Äôt enjoy the Nemo one. The queue waiting time is way too long for just a rollercoaster (we queued for 1.30h!) and they don‚Äôt have fast track at all.
Overall it was a great day with great attractions and things to do! :)",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Great Park,We had a great time in this park. Our favourite thing we did in the whole of disneyland was the stunt show in this park. We used the lineberty app to meet the characters and had no problem booking our slots.

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Squirrelly Layout,"The attractions in the park are the typical Disney Studios. The stunt show was top notch, although it was a bit interesting to follow between the French and the English translations. The lines for photo ops with characters seemed a bit shorter here than in Paris Disney. The Ratatouille ride was pretty cool and even if you aren't a fan of the film, if you're an engineer or programmer, you'd enjoy figuring out how they actually operate the ride. Biggest challenge was the overall layout of the park. Either because of the stunt show or some short term construction the park was basically laid out in a big V or W and you always had to come back to a central point rather than being able to cut across areas like in Disney Paris or other Disney parks. The food court was a bit chaotic, but the food was pretty good for as busy as they were.","Written September 5, 2019"

I cant imagine how annoyed you be if you paid just to come here.

Also one of the main rides Crush doesn't have fast pass so be prepared for 100 minute ques.","Written September 5, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Tower of terror nine times!,"I love the tower of terror, it has been and still my favourite theme park ride. Its great that this park still has Disneyland California‚Äôs version of the tower of terror and none of this guardians of the galaxy nonsense. It is so good that i rode it nine times in four days. The Walt Disney studios park gets five stars just for having tower of terror.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Theme Park,"Went here with a two children of which one is Autistic. The check in process in the Autistic line was a disgrace. The attendant looked at our evidence produced and said it was not what they need and required. It was then pointed out to here that she did not even bother to read the statement properly and then she said it was okay. It took almost 3 hours to get a pass sorted out for my autistic child, which is totally unacceptable.
Once inside the park, the disabled entrance was used for the child which in all fairness kept him from having a meltdown and it seemed to work for all the rides.

I found that it was shocking that when you purchased goods in the shops that they do not supply you with a bag, but you have to purchase one of their bag for life types. Consider the over inflated prices that you pay for their goods, a bag is not going to hurt.","Written September 3, 2019"

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Thoroughly enjoyed,"Spent 1.5 days of our (almost) 4 day holiday in this park. I think we probably enjoyed the studios more than the main park as a family. It seemed a bit more relaxed here and the crowds and queues were a bit more manageable, particularly if you make the most of mornings here before it gets too busy.
We all really enjoyed the car stunt show and Mickey and the magician. Ratatouille ride is clever and good fun, the kids also liked the flying carpets and slinky dog, the park would benefit from more rides in general, particularly for young children, but it‚Äôs the shows that make it worthwhile. Tower of terror and rock n roller coaster (so sad it‚Äôs closing) are fantastic big rides. We also managed to meet buzz and Daisy Duck in this park - you need to book a slot through an app to meet them but it worked really well.
Down sides to the park are the lack of food options (there‚Äôs a food festival at the moment but only thing that suited our family were cones of chips, otherwise there was 1 counter service burger bar and 1 buffet open in the entire park) and lack of shade in some ride queues (it was over 30degrees and some of the queues for meet and greets and rides are in full sun)","Written August 31, 2019"

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Desperately In need of some more attractions,We‚Äôre big Disney fans & this was our second trip to DLP in five years. Studios has a couple of big thrill rides but overall is lacking in attractions for the amount of money that is paid to visit here. Tower of Terror is the standout attraction and is a must do (especially as it may be turning into a Marvel themed ride in coming years). Crush‚Äôs Coaster is fast spinning fun but the wait times rarely fall below 60 mins when it‚Äôs summer time. Rock N Roller is closing & there are already rides under refurb. Hopefully the new additions in the next few years will inject some energy into this park.,
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Less than we expected,"We usually love studios but this visit was very underwhelming. Out of the 4 rides we went on 3 of them broke down while we were on it. Stranded on slinky dog with a just turned 1 year off old all hot and bothered was not good! The tram tour studio needs updating badly I mean the fire and water bit was cool the rest was terrible. On a positive note we loved tower of terror and ratatouille as rides and loved the stitch live show. The whole park needs some major updating and refurbishing and expanding we need new stuff, it‚Äôs my 6th visit and nothing has changed.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Hardly any attractions!,I can‚Äôt believe how sparse it is! We spent approx 1.5 hours there and had run out of things to do. Waited for the stunt show which was brilliant & left.,"Written August 28, 2019"

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Easy than Disneyland,"Visiting in August is one of the busiest months and super hot so prepare for that!
I would advise queuing for the single riders as the waiting times are almost half that of the double riders! The ratatouille ride is well worth the short wait being 4D.
The stitch live show is very funny and a good wait , just be prepared for people trying to push in!
The favourite ride is the tower of terror which indeed is the longest queue but keep checking back as the queue does go down pretty well! The studio team tour is very fun and cute but very outdated.
There are more food choices here than the other park but we did find that the small food trucks were very rude staff.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Nice change from main park,The rides seem closer together here so easier to get around and there are some good shows here like Mickey and the Magician which was better than I expected.

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Fantastic Visit for all ages,"We loved the studios, plenty of characters and smaller queues than in the other park. Only a 30 minute wait for Aerosmith with is amazing and not to missed. We grabbed a fast pass for Tower of Terror as it is a very popular ride, this has to be my number one ride and not to be missed. The tram tour is good as it shows you how the effects happen in films.
We went to Stitch Live which is hilarious for all ages, shows are done in 2 different languages so check the time for the language you want.
Download the Libertine app as this is what you need to book a slot for some of the characters such as Woody and Daisy Duck.
Minnie Mouse was here and we did have to queue for a while but it was worth it, you are not rushed when you meet the characters at all. Check the Disneyland Park app for where the characters are as they are not always in obvious places.
Great day here for all ages as we ranged from 9 to 60. Great Mickey Mouse shapes waffles here as well.
The park is exceptionally clean as well.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Hollywood Tower & Rocking Roller Coaster are musts,Very expensive since you have to purchase a 90 euro fast past besides admission if you don't want to wait on lines all day. Hollywood Tower & Rocking Roller Coaster are excellent rides.,"Written August 15, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,More Compact,"The layout of the main park is such that large distances have to be tramped even to reach the first attraction. Here in the Studio Park, however, attractions are closer together, and signposting is better. The other side of the coin is that crowds in the high season can be very dense. Timing is everything here. Try to arrive when most others are leaving (tea time) when waits can be much shorter. The new 4D Ratatouille ride is a big success, and the backlots tour still has the power to shock, even when you know it's coming. With its coasters, stage shows and spectacles, there is plenty to see and do here, with less ground to cover than in the Magic Kingdom.

Nothing can beat going on the Hollywood tower of terror and rock n rollercoaster although the latter is being removed to make way for what looks like will be a marvel area which is great for marvel fans.

The crush‚Äôs coaster ride seemed to have frequent issues and also has no fast pass available so we used our full magic hour one day queuing for crush‚Äôs coaster which wasn‚Äôt able to open until the hour was basically up due to technical issues with getting the ride to spin as it‚Äôs supposed to so felt like a bit of a waste of our additional time but the queue easily gets to two hours and we really wanted to ride it.

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Under construction,"As a family we are massive fans of the Disney Parks and we appreciate that they need to be constantly updated. We do feel, however, that the current feel of Studios Park is one of 'closed'. There are some great not to be missed rides and attractions that need to be seen as part of the Disneyland Paris experience. Tower of Terror, Rock n Roller coaster, Crushes Coaster, Ratatouille as well as the live experiences. These are great rides/experiences but you can't help but be distracted by the fact that there are a lot of rides and spaces not being used. Is would hope it's not going to take to long for more of it to be opened up. There seems to be a lot of closed rides in both parks.
We purchased an annual pass as we were in the parks over four days. The one we got only has a few block out days and gives 10% of food and purchases. Worth looking into on the Disney website. We also have an autistic child in our party who was very well looked after. With the correct paper work you can get a ride priority access card (amazing if your child goes wild in the queue with the stress of it) and even a free carers ticket, although they don't do a carers annual pass like Merlin in the UK do.
Overall I think you would be mad to not go to this park but we are feeling very impatient about the construction.","Written July 31, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Best bit of Disneyland Paris,Hands down this was the best bit of our Disney adventure. We did like some of the rides in the main park but the Studios was more laidback with shorter queues and a little gem of a ride on the Aerosmith rollercoaster. There was more variety in the food department with street food (still ridiculously expensive ‚Ç¨6 for a two bite chicken gyros). Staff seemed more human. We also did not see any of the angry violence that happened in the min park either.,"Written July 31, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Quite a different experience to the Disneyland Park - but just as fun!,"We're relatively hard-core Disney fans - we've gone to the parks in the USA every time for multiple days on 5 separate trips. Before we went to Paris I was really keen to find a comparison between Walt Disney Studios Park in Paris & California Adventure Park. So here goes! :

Walking in the main hangar type entrance ‚Äì was incredible! It was a very cool atmosphere & we looked around the shops in here on our way out at the end of the day.

We were on a mission to get to the Ratatouille ride! We always go straight to the most popular ride on arrival in the morning & get that done before the lines get long ‚Äì but we didn't have a lot of waiting at all at that time of the year. Ratatouille was my personal favourite ride - uniquely Parisian & fun for the whole family!

We expected being at a Disney park at Christmas would be magical. It sort of was ... the decorations the characters were all dressed up - so it LOOKED like Christmas, but just didn't entirely FEEL the love. My son noticed that there wasn't as much 'ambient music' playing & things happening (I‚Äôm not talking about big parades & shows etc, but just little atmospheric cheer being spread would be nice). Perhaps this is why there was a little less atmosphere? However, to answer the burning question I had prior to arrival - it most definitely still does feel like Disneyland!

This being said - there was no question we were in Paris as there were lovely subtle touches everywhere to remind us! Although there are some areas which are common to Cali adventure park, there are also very uniquely Paris areas of the park!

We have found the staff in California to be extremely attentive, friendly & helpful. The staff in Paris weren't quite as attentive as in USA, but they were typically Disney - very friendly, very helpful & smiling ‚Äì perhaps just in a more Parisian way!
Our teens (who've been visiting Disney since they were 6 & 9 - now 15 & 18) absolutely loved the Aerosmith Rockin‚Äô Rollercoaster. The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror is always a favourite ‚Äì especially now the one in California has gone.

One thing we really love about Disney parks is that while you wait in line for rides, you are sheltered. We were super lucky with weather, but if it had been raining (or when the sun shines in summer) there's usually somewhere under cover to wait.

The Studio Tour was pretty cool & compared well to the one we did at Universal Studios in California a couple of years earlier. The car show was absolutely outstanding ‚Äì definitely one of the most favourite shows we‚Äôve seen.

There was a Goofy‚Äôs Christmas show in the evening that was projected onto the Tower of Terror. That was pretty awesome. The only disappointment being that people in front of us insisted on lifting their kids onto their shoulders which would then block the view of everyone behind. Selfie sticks are frowned upon now ‚Äì so why is it ok for kids to block others views? Surely they can just hold the child on their hip so that the childs head is at the same level as their own??

As far as getting in & out of the park - security was tight, as in Cali & as we expected - which we love. Once inside we feel safe & happy. We have absolutely, always taken in a plastic bottle of water each (which are easily refilled in the park, either at a water fountain or staff are always happy to refill in cafes etc) & snacks. There's places to buy food everywhere - whether you want something sit down & fancy or to grab a quick snack - & every price bracket in between too. Yes, the little carts can be a bit pricey, but we've found the cafes & pizza places etc to be relatively affordable.

Feel free to ask any questions! I think I've thought of everything, but we love Disney & are happy to share what we've learned!",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Loved it!,"Loved the park! Plenty to do for all ages! For young kids would recommend The slinky ride & toy story parachute drop, Aladdin‚Äôs magic carpet. For older Crush‚Äôs Coaster and the Tower of Terror (very scary!!) we also watched the car stunt show where a man set himself on fire which was cool & the Stitch Live show was also very good! and of course the studios tram tour is a must!

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Hen Party,"We visited on a 1 day 2 park ticket, and have to say we much preferred the Studios to the other park. The rides had less queues, and the atmosphere was better and more spacious, with better food selections than the other park. As always with theme parks there was limited choice of food, but there were water fountains which we made use of with our refillable bottles.","Written July 28, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Not a Place for anyone with a Handicap!!!!!,"We were there in July, 2019. I was in a wheelchair. It was not a good experience. I obviously could not walk more than a few steps, but because I forgot my doctors letter and Handicap placard back at home, it did not matter. Not one ounce of sympathy or consideration from staff members. Some were down right rude. We stayed in lines when we could, but some rides could or would not accomodate a wheelchair at all. So I would sit in the shade while my family members went on the rides they could.
This was our first and last time at Disneyland Paris. I don't know where they got their training, but it was a terrible experience. Four days of terrible. Not at all like Florida or California where EVERYONE is kind and helpful and friendly. I could not believe the indifference of the ""cast members"" when you could find one. Unless it was at a ride entrance or exit, or at a food place, one harldy ever saw a worker to ask for help, directions, etc.
Several of the rides kept breaking down.. One morning for ""early magic hours"", there were five rides that were closed for repair!! Ridiculous!! They would open up, then close again. Not the Disney experience we are used to.
DON'T GO!! So many better things to do in Paris itself.","Written July 26, 2019"

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,More things for older children/adults,We enjoyed a few of the things in the park with our 6 year old. Ratatouille was really good as is the Micky Magic show.

We've been to the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim countless number of times. While we enjoy the new Guardians of the Galaxy ride that replaced the Tower of Terror, we miss the old hotel's storytelling. We were thrilled to find the Tower of Terror alive and well at the Hollywood Studios park, and we hope it's there forever.",

Car circuit thing also closed for part of the time. Aerosmith RollerCoaster good, daughters enjoyed Tower of Terror and a Toy Story Ride. Very small Park compared with Disneyland, and much less to do and see, very little effort in presenting the park itself - at least with Disneyland you can enjoy looking at the themed areas even if you cannot get on the rides because of the length of the queues, or they're closed or the staff don't recognse the fast pass. Our daughters in their early 20s. We had a few drinks - very uninspiring and did not see anywhere we could feed our vegan daughter.

We enjoyed it, but only spent a few hours there, as there is less to do.

We loved Ratatouille and that was recommended by girl who checked us in. We loved it so much we went on three times, using Fast Pass. We also went on Crush's Coaster, but it was a long wait for a very short ride and not as expected, but OK.

There wasn't as many people smoking in this park, but those who were seemed to be allowed to anywhere and everywhere, which is a bit disappointing.

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Thrills all round for older kids,"We spent four days in Disneyland, and visited the studios on 2 of those days. It's a smaller space than the main park, and has more high speed rides and less for younger kids. It's still worth coming with young kids as they'll love slinky dog, ratatouille, and posing for photos with the big statues of TRex and Buzz Lightyear. But if you're not into fast / high rides, you won't need to spend more than a couple of hours here.
Make sure to get in early if you want to ride Crush's Coaster - it always had the longest queue of any ride we saw. When we arrived at 9am, the queue was 70 mins. We couldn't face that first thing in the morning, so returned at lunchtime instead- the queue was even longer then, but we used the time to eat lunch and top up our sunscreen - the queue is well shaded.
We went to the motor stunt show and thouroughly enjoyed it- not generally big fans of motorbikes and fast cars but this was really entertaining, and a welcome break from walking/queuing!
Our kids aged 13 & 10 loved Crush, Tower of Terror, Rc, Parachute drop, and especially Rock'n'Rollercoaster, which they rode three times in a row using fastpass! Tip: if your kids want to ride something and you don't, scan everybody's ticket for fastpass anyway, so those who want to ride can use the extra fastpass.","Written July 11, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Small but nice ..,"Small park mostly shows and few rides which you can totally finish in one day and enjoy the shows. Start from no 5 on the right with crush coaster .. if u have teens
and magic carpet for little ones. I enjoyed Ratatouille. Few food trucks with good variety... chips.. falafel.. wraps.. Spanish rice..pizza.. etc. followed by the tower of terror and rock coaster . Mosteus is a nice show ..( check timings) .
Admission price and food as on the higher side as expected in Europe. You can bring your own snacks .. food.. and water ( u can refill from different places ).
We had the fast pass for both parks ( extra 150‚Ç¨) as it was extremely busy with waiting times around 50 min ( without the pass). We went for 2 parks one day which was sufficient for our teens with fast pass unlimited. As we didn‚Äôt have to book timings with this pass.
Nice but I wouldn‚Äôt want to visit again. Compared to Europa Park... Germany wins.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Fab fab park,"Such an amazing park, what a great day. So much for kids and adults to do. Lots of places to fill your water bottles so helps save you money.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Far too small to be it's own park,"Visited here and Disneyland Paris on the same day...and thank god we never paid just for the studios park as we would have been very disappointed.

The park is small with just a handful of rides. Some are shut for refurbishment which doesnt help.

We got round the park in 3 hours...it would have been much less had we not waited 40 minutes for the parachute ride only for it to break down just before we got on it.

The Studios tour is rubbish compared to the one in America..Tower of terror really is the only highlight.

Staff late to open up on the Tower of terror fastpass line so meant queues had built up on other rides therefore nullyfying getting a fastpass.

All in all a big disappointment and wont be going back.","Written July 9, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Mickey & The Magician,"A tremendously good theme park. A lot smaller than the main Disneyland Park however what it lacks in size it makes up for in attractions. We didn't go on Crush's coaster as waiting times are never below an hour even in Extra Magic Hour times....however we did go on Ratatouille twice which was excellent as was Toy Story Land. The little ones will love Slink Dog coaster.

Plenty of themed restaurant and shops as well which was a bonus on a fantastically hot day !

The icing on the cake for my little one was seeing Buzz Lightyear which we booked pronto at 9:45am via the excellent Lineberty app.

Note: You need to be near the park to book your ticket via the app.

We also saw Minnie this way. Definitely saves the hassle of queueing.

The Monsters Inc. screaming corner is also excellent for some family fun trying to out scream each other!!!

Mickey & The Magician is by far for us the best thing in the park. Be there early for showtime's as they tend to fill up quickly. The show is dual language but easy to grasp. Brilliant acting, dancing and singing on a par if not better than Broadway/West End. Our highlight by far.

One day if researched and booked meet and greets right is sufficient enough for the park.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Way better than everyone says,"As an American, everyone told me I would hate Disneyland Paris and the Studios ‚Äúwhen compared to the US parks‚Äù. Well, I disagree. I found both the be awesome. Sure the studios are smaller. But there were still plenty of large and impressive attractions to pique my interest. The studios have two of the best rides in Disneyland Paris: the ratatouille ride and Crush‚Äôs Coaster. There were also lots of unique character meet and greets (which require a ticket from the Lineberty app), and lots of cool shows. One of the neatest Disney restaurants ever (Bistro Chez Remy) is in the studios as well. I loved that park!

Tower of terror - the best ride without a doubt!!
The queues weren‚Äôt that bad at all, think the worst we waited was 50 mins.
We were in the que for Ratatouille & it broke down while we was in it, but we chose to stay in the que, think we in total waited 60 mins but that was with the break down. There was a fire door next to us but we stuck it out & im glad as it‚Äôs always a crazy busy line! & the fast passes run out quick!
The fast pass system is very helpful & it allows you to plan your day a bit & make sure you get on the main rides.
Think the toy story land area needs the fast pass system as it was crazy queue times for the rides in that area at all times!
Was a bit sad the art of animation was closed but it‚Äôs being refurbished.
Marvel is a bit rammed down your throat in this park which I‚Äôm not a fan of as it isn‚Äôt original Disney.

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Wonderful time spent together with the family,"It is really very good. Leaflets are in English which makes things easier.
The only thing is that you end up waiting hours for less than 5min. ride. This delays everything.
Also , we were quite misfortune as it was raining all the time every day when we needed to be at Disneyland.
The place is quite big - it takes time to walk around and get to each place but this is not an issue at all - at least not for me.
Buffalo Bill western show was amazing too.
The good thing is that you don't need tickets in order to go to Disney village. You only pass through the security and you can walk - this gives a chance to know at least part of the area.
In that way you don't loose precious time and your day in wasting your tickets.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,It's Disney - and a solid half-day of fun entertainment,"As a seasoned Disney fanatic, I have lots of opinions about Disney parks. This one is a fun throwback if you're a regular in Florida -- enjoy the (Lights) Moteurs Action show that originated here and has been and gone from Florida's Studios park, and also Catastrophe Canyon! I love this version of the Backlot Tour -- a video onboard your tram is a conversation between an English-speaking actor and a French-speaking one, cleverly scripted so that you'll get the essentials from either language but a richer experience if you understand both. The highlight for me was the Ratatouille ride -- love this attraction and look forward to welcoming it to Epcot next year! This park is pretty small and while its attractions are good, there aren't many of them. Anticipate seeing everything in 6-8 hours or less depending on line waits.","Written June 11, 2019"
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,It was all about Crush‚Äôs Coaster,"Disney needs to introduce a Fastpass for this ride, THE MOST POPULAR RIDE IN ALL OF DISNEYLAND. We got there as the park opened (actually, before it opened) and thought we were one of the 1st, but the extra magic hours and disney hotel people were there first and at 9:45 the queues were at 90mins. Fantastic ride, but landed up as single riders every time (60mins waits). Go to RocknRoller first in the morning because it stays at 5-15mins until about 11:30. Get fastpasses for the Tower of Terror before this ride. Ratatouille fills up FAST after 11am, but you‚Äôre in a good place if you opt
For single riders. Restaurant Chez Remy is impossible to get a place at and is fully booked for a month at a time.

It lacked any Disney magic that the other parks have. The shops were tiny and didn't have many options, the queues for rides weren't well themed so there was nothing to entertain you for the 45+ minute wait. The park seemed almost forgotten about.

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Hit and Miss,"Having been a few years previously this visit was extremely disappointing.

Many rides closed either for maintenance or other reasons. I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt stagger the closures.

Some queue times were insane. We queued for fast pass tickets for Tower of Terror and got to the front of the line and found one machine working which then broke. Staff response was oh well come back later. Not acceptable when you‚Äôve queued for 20 min already. We finally got him to write out a fast pass ticket for us.

Queued again for Mickey and the Magician. Half our party were in the queue and half were behind getting a drink. When they came to join us they weren‚Äôt allowed in as they said they reached capacity. So we all left the queue. I then saw someone else arguing the same problem who was let in. I then vigorously complained and we were finally let in. The show itself was good though.

Staff in general are disinterested and apathetic.

Too much is spoken in French and not translated to English.

It‚Äôs easy to remember Disney has little involvement in this venture and it‚Äôs worlds apart from either Disney park in USA.

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,ok. not amazing.,"Again, I enjoyed visiting Disneyland Paris to ride the different rides not available at other parks and to enjoy the differences presented in rides that are offered at both parks.

For the price of entry, Disney needs to build more rides. These parks charge almost the same rate as Orlando and offer way less.

The scheduling of the character meet and greets are ridiculous. We saw many children turned away midday! Characters only seemed to be out in small windows right before lunch. This is absolutely absurd for a theme park who caters to small children.

Also, they really need to do something about the obscene amount of adults smoking in lines. I understand that in a different country, the French smoke. However, this is still a children's theme park.","Written June 4, 2019"

We watched all 3 of the marvel shows and looked round the big figures(hulk, iron man and black panther) the indoor show is the best. We met captain marvel who had great interaction with us and gave us autographs, better organisation needed for captain America & Spider-Man meets. The cars stunt show is a must, very well choreographed to capture everyone‚Äôs minds. There‚Äôs rides for every type of person here, with the more tame tram tours & ratatouille, to the scary heights of tower of terror or the spinning rock & roller. Looking forward to that being adapted to an iron man theme in the future. Be sure to scream in the monsters inc machines and have a photo with mike. Inside the studios building there‚Äôs shops and restaurants with marvel themes. Quite a few meet and greets are done in studios and if you have a green card you can prebook a time slot so you don‚Äôt have to queue just speak to the staff on duty and they‚Äôll be able to help you. All cast members who we dealt with were helpful and polite. Toilets could be better signposted if you have no clue where you‚Äôre going.
Really looking forward to the future expansions including more marvel rides and the reopening of some of the closed ones currently.","Written June 3, 2019"

We probably would have spent longer except several rides were closed. Highlights included Flying Carpets Over Agrabah, the Ratatouille ride (don't be put off by the warning to people with motion sickness, as it is a far tamer ride than most of those that do not feature such a warning), Studio Tram Tour: Behind the Magic, and Moteurs ...

Wait for any attraction, wait for food, wait for a drink, wait for an icecream and so on. You can of course bypass the waiting by bying a fastpass or ultimate fastpass but that is crazy if you have little kids with you. You can also see the fastpass system is creating a queue at the machines and a queue at the fastpass entrance. Better take a lot of money with you as even the most basic drinks are expensive.

Pitty so many attractions were closed for maintenance. If 6 out of 18 are closed for maintenance, do you get back 33% of the entrance price as well??","Written June 1, 2019"

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,More to do than ever before!,"The last time I visited Walt Disney Studios back in 2006, it was a bit of a let down. There were three main rides, two shows (one of which was aimed at very young children) and a whole lot of not much else.

I was so surprised to find that the Studios Park is now a full days entertainment! We arrived very early to make the most of the extra magic hour, and didn't leave the park until the late afternoon!

Crush's Coaster and The Twilight Tower of Terror were the two rides which really stood out as highlights (although I definitely would not recommend the Tower of Terror for little ones because it had me screaming at the top of my lungs so hard my voice went).

I was a happy to learn that Animagique had closed a couple of years ago and had since been replaced by a new show. Animagique had had been aimed at an exceptionally young audience and was a dull and difficult watch for anyone over the age of 6. The show that is now in the theatre, Mickey and the Magician, is an absolute MUST SEE! It was a 25-30 minute long spectacular! West End quality dance numbers, live singing, stage magic, impressive set and costume design and special effects, everything you could hope for. My friend got a little teary initially because a lot of old favourites turn up during the show, Lumiere from Beauty and the Beast, Rafiki from the Lion King. Of course it had a moment with Olaf and Elsa from Frozen, I don't think Disney are confident in any new venture appealing to children without the inclusion of some Frozen reference. But overall, a fantastic sow!

There were shows going on outside all day with pyrotechnics and stunts, there were enough places to buy food and drink (although it is odd that once inside the park, the majority of food is served out of small catering vans which amass large queues quickly) and so many rides to go on.

Definitely get your fastpass for: Crush's Coaster (unless you arrive first thing in the morning using extra magic hours to get in the queue before it opens), Ratatouille, Tower of Terror from mid-afternoon onwards.

And do download the Disneyland Paris app so you can see what rides have shorter wait times. We ended up on rides I would never have chosen myself because they had short wait times, and I ended up having a fantastic time...the toy soldiers parachute jump is great fun!

A very recent influx of superheroes has started to give the place a much more genuine, movie magic feel. Look forward to seeing it again in the future when the Star Wars, Marvel and frozen expansion opens!","Written May 31, 2019"

France,Walt Disney Studios Park,So many closures the park was just too bust,"We visited in May half term for the second time and were really disappointed with this park after having a great time two years ago. There are simply so many ride closures and boarded up areas that the park is very busy, hard to navigate with a buggy and just not much fun. The only redeeming feature was the two shows - both were great and well produced but you had to be in line a minimum of 30 mins before the show time to stand a chance of getting in. In terms of other rides Cars, Slinky Spin, Armageddon, Disney Animation, Disney Juniors, and Stitch Live are all closed, our kids are too small for the two coasters, the tower of terror or RC racer so that left 3 rides, all of which had mammoth queues, I suppose all the closures means everyone is piling on to the remaining rides. Personally we‚Äôll be giving it a skip for a good few years until the building works are complete - for the volume of rides a merlin pass is better value for money. We also had a tough time with the Lineberty app which you need to book character meets - after 4 days of constant network errors and full queues we only managed one ticket - the idea is great but the execution is really poor.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,Of course you need childrens that force you to go there ... or not.,"I went there on 1998 with my family and the experience was really good. First on the Disney Studios Park for 2 days and 4 days for the Disney Land Park. Was enough time to visit both, but you need the ""Fast-Pass"" ticket (not for Disey Studios park), because there is a lot of people waiting at the attractions.
Talking about the hotels ... it depends on the blue tone of your blood. For me was fine the Cheyenne Hotel ... of course was only for sleep and breakfast. The lunch was every day at the parks and the dinner at Disney Village places (one different each day). Buffalo Bill one of thoose nights, and one day beakfast with Goofy and Donald and ...

Also, Crash's Coaster was amazing and worth the wait, another one not to be missed! Some rides close early for the closing show, but the park is great at warning customers about this and there are lots of signs posted about this!

A range of rides for all ages and so many amazing different worlds to explore and enjoy.",
France,Walt Disney Studios Park,An Embarrassment to the Disney Name,"This park is absolutely shocking and an embarrassment to the Disney name.

Not enough rides for a start. The Aerosmith coaster is a joke, failing to follow the standard of the original Orlando coaster and cutting back on the ride theming so the rider doesn't get to fully understand that the point of the ride is to escort the band to their gig.

Crushes Coaster is meant to be the prime ride in the park. Set as an indoor coaster it lacks the intense ride theming that Disney is famous for in the US. There is limited ride theming at the start of the ride, but most of the ride is just in the dark. No photopass on this ride (seriously!?!?!) and lacks Nemo themed merchandising at the end of the ride.

Tower of Terror is a scaled down ride compared to the US, but your ticket price isn't scaled down.

Stitch Live was closed, even though it wasnt advertised to be. RC was also closed. Blockbuster Cafe was closed, and a large part of the park was closed off for renovations.

Ratatouille ride was the best ride in the park, well worth the wait, but sadly yet another ride with no Photo opportunity.

Overall, the standard in this park is poor.","Written May 18, 2019"

Paths lead round the island, passing vineyards and several little chapels and canon ball ovens, dating from Napoleonic days when they were heated to cause more damage to passing shipping. The monks were not there at that time, the monastery having been sold after the Revolution. We were fortunate to come upon the abbey church just as the monks were about to sing one of the short services, very appropriate for Maundy Thursday. Wonderful gardens along the church approach. A shop selling wine, holy cards, perfume, books and much else.

France,Iles de Lerins,A lovely walk on Isle St Marguerite,It is interesting that the two islands are coupled together as it is not possible to go from one island to the other without returning to Cannes. We have been going to Cannes for many years and it was a standing joke that we had never walked around either island. I am so pleased this has now been rectified. It is a place for wonderful walks - even in January! I suspect it is more of on island for walks and picnics rather than laying out towels and sunbathing. Not much sand and just rocky coves apart from western end. A lovely place to stroll around and the castle is far bigger than I expected.,"Written January 15, 2019"

France,Iles de Lerins,An average destination,"This is a sweet little trip but not a top-ten to-do. The history is wonderful and has compelling story lines, with the monastery and of course, man in the iron (it was actually black velvet) mask. But it only has moderately well cared for buildings, a very average restaurant with relatively brusque service, and a waaay overpriced wine shop for not-very-special wine. Walking around the pretty little island is nice enough.","Written October 10, 2018"
France,Iles de Lerins,Day trip to both islands.,"We visited both isles du st marguertie and islea du st honorant, over the course of morning and afternoon. We bought our tickets on the morning of the trip, there is no need to pre book as there is plenty of room on the boats and they run frequently.
We travelled to St Marguerite in the morning and walked around half of the island and visited the fort. The views are incredible, and the water is Crystal clear. You could possibly bring your swimsuit and a picnic and spend the whole day there. It is the larger of the islands and there is plenty of beaches and coves.
We visited the second island in the afternoon, it is much smaller but there is still lots to see, inculding the monestry, the fortresse and loads of chapelles are the island. You can also buy wine in the shop that is made on the island.",
France,Iles de Lerins,Beautiful √éle de Saint-Honorat,"The boat trip over to the island was fun with a close up of some awesome super-yachts in the harbour! Although it's only a short trip, the island feels a world away from the hubbub of Cannes and is so relaxing with stunning views of the mainland.
There is some historical information in English about the vineyards and the cannonball refinery etc. We particularly enjoyed the large lift-the-flap information wall near the monastery answering all those things you'd ask a monk if you could! For example, 'Do monks know what is going on in the outside World?' - lift the flap and you find that 'Yes, we read newspapers in the morning' or 'What do you pray for?' etc. It's really well thought out and gives a great insight into the lives of the monks on the island and would also be fun for children. Its hard to believe that there have been monks on the island for over 1500 years - those who live there now are self-supporting through the sale of their own wine from grapes grown and sold on the island.
If you plan to visit the central monastery you must be dressed respectfully.
There's a snack bar selling reasonably priced sandwiches etc plus a restaurant. There are plenty of benches and seats for your own picnic.
Maybe use the loos at the ferry dock on the mainland! The ones on the island (first left) are hole-in-the-floor type and were iffy when we were there. The others are at the cafe and for clientele only.","Written September 12, 2018"
France,Iles de Lerins,Visiting St. Marguritte,"On a beautiful sunny day we set off from the port of Cannes to the ferry for our 15 minuet journey to St.Marguerite. The Island is beautiful with natural paths, trees and shrubs and absolutely beautiful views. The path to the fort ( the museum) is uphill and has uneven steps. Admission to the Museum is 9 Euros for adults. The museum houses the jail room where the Man In The Iron Mask was interred, as well as artifacts from the area and a fantastic exhibition.
I must admit that I was disappointed with the room that held the man in the iron mask. The room was empty. We all agreed that this could have been staged given all the writing available on this man.
The exhibit and short film about the works of Jason D. Taylor is worth the price of admission. Jason Taylor placed life size statues of perple, trees, mermaids and boats made of a special cement that does contain metal and they were placed on the floor of the sea in Spain, London, and Granada. These statues were placed there for the regeneration of coral and sea vegetation. In addition there are photographs of these article when the vegetation and coral started to grow.
It‚Äôs a very good idea to bring lunch or snacks.","Written September 4, 2018"

The place has such a relaxed and much less hectic vibe than the cote d'Azur. The trip across from Juan les Pins (20 mins) is quick and fun, with a double decker boat going at a fair pace across the water with some wonderful views across the Gulf of Juan.

But the tree lined walks across the island - approximately 1 km south to north and approximately 2 km east to west - are ravishing. As are the swimming conditions, far from the madding crowd! Highly recommended family day trip. Arrive early, stay late.",

The island is peaceful and with beautiful natural surroundings, but as with everything, exploitation of tourists is the order of the day. We had paid to come over from Cannes but were not allowed to drink the water and soda we bought at the bar and sit on the seats provided. We were abruptly asked to go to picnic area while they were serving small light beers etc for 9 E each!! Everywhere in France seems to have these petty rules and they soon tell you!

France,Iles de Lerins,A lovely place to escape for a while,"We visited the island of Sainte Marguerite for a few hours on our recent trip to Cannes. It cost ‚Ç¨15 for adults and ‚Ç¨9.50 for children (cheaper if you book online) and is a pleasant 15 minute trip each way. Even my husband who doesn't travel well on boats enjoyed it and my six year old loved it. We walked part way round the coastal path which was stunning and then cut through the eucalyptus alley which was lovely and fragrant. We saw plenty of lovely butterflies, birds, lizards and a few massive ants as well as a locust. I would recommend taking swimwear and a towel to have a dip in the sea from one of the secluded coves. We didn't go in the fort museum as read there wasn't much for your money, instead we walked round the outside. If we return to Cannes we'll definitely go back to the island to explore further.","Written June 5, 2018"
France,Iles de Lerins,Wouah,If you have some time you shouldn‚Äôt miss it. It is marvellous. You can have a little walk around the island and if you booked a boat by yourself you can enjoy a swim in blue water!!!,
France,Iles de Lerins,Quiet and restful piece of paradize,"First - the bad part. These are islands, which obviously means you can't drive there. You'll either navigate by your own (rent a canoe, a dinghy, a yacht - YMMV), or use one of the lines going there (from Cannes, mainly). Keep in mind that all options (especially the acquisition of the 300ft-long ship) are expensive. It's ~15EUR for a return ticket.
=> Book online, it's cheaper. <=

Once there, you are free to walk anywhere you'd like. There's the museum with the Iron Mask's cell, but the best part clearly are the paths in the woods, the smell of the pines, and the quietness of the plains.

Visit the monastery on √éle de Saint-Honorat and if you catch a mass or a stay-over retreat then you can really breathe the sea air and spiritual sense of the place. Originally founded in 410, the monastery was rebuilt a few times with the current one existing from the 19th c.

There is a boat from Cannes port which commutes every one hour, dropping and picking up the passengers. This is a small island, surrounded with trees and vineyards. On the one end you will encounter a majestic abbey facing the sea. Enter it and you will see elegant arches and terraces giving you an aerial view. Walk towards the chapel after that and shop for the wines, soaps, olive oil, and other items produced by the monks in the island. There is a restaurant in the island and you can have a tasty lunch from there.
Carry a bottle fo water with you as there are no shops in the island. Wear running shoes and carry a jacket if it is too windy.",

A nice short trip across, approx. 20 mins, and a large area to wander round.

France,Iles de Lerins,Well worth a trip,"We enjoyed a full day on Sainte Marguerite via an hour long but fairly speedy, Trans Cote D'Azur boat trip from Nice. Had a surprise close encounter with a sperm whale on the outward journey!
A couple of stalls and toilet facilities at the landing but if you're going to venture around the island take a picnic and plenty to drink! Numerous places to picnic, swim and relax. The interior of the island was very peaceful but it was hard to entirely ""get away from it all"" on the coastal stretches as there were a lot of visitors to the island in this first week of September. The frequent boats arriving from Cannes (a much shorter crossing than from Nice) seemed to be packed to the rafters! Doubt you could get lost as pedestrian tracks are wide, well maintained and lots of maps/signs. Great to see grey-white flamingoes in the nature reserve.... A beautiful island though and a really relaxing experience. I could see that children could be quite bored if they were there for a day from Nice (9am-7pm) unless they were prepared for a mix of walking, nature and beach-time? A couple of things to note. Firstly, even though we'd read that there were no vehicles on this island, we were taken aback by a van hurtling down the one short run of road on the approach to the boat landing! We did see a few vehicles around the ""port"" area. Secondly when we crossed the island on our way back to the boat we passed by La Guerite restaurant at about 5pm; it was raucously noisy and it literally seemed like a rave was in progress - don't know if this is some party venue but if you've come here for peace and tranqulity, it will be shattered in this particular location!","Written September 24, 2017"

France,Iles de Lerins,Go exploring!,We spent one of our 4 days on this island and it was probably the best! I would recommend going from the port straight to the opposite side of the island (down Allee Sainte-Marguerite). There are some secluded rocky beaches which were wonderful and private. The area was also a lot nicer than all the other beach areas we walked past on the way back to the port. Although because of the rocks it was harder to swim than on the more beachy areas. I would highly recommend taking food/water/ a picnic with you. Although there are free water taps on the island there is little in the way of food. We only brought one sandwich which just about lasted us the day!,

The museum has relics from two wrecks the oldest being a Roman galleon that sunk just off the end of the island.
If you feel energetic there are many walks cris crossing the island through the pine woods. If you want to learn new water skills we saw people learning to wind surf and sail from the island. The beaches are a mix of stones and sand and many visitors were swimming in the clear water.
Ferries run from the old port in Cannes close to the heliport and lighthouse. The trip across to Saint-Marguerite only takes about 10-15 minutes. We thought this was well worth a trip for the afternoon.","Written September 7, 2016"

the sea is crystal clear, the water is cold but amazing.
there are a couple of nice restaurants which are easily affordable, and also la Guerite, which is really high end, and not suitable if you are not dressed up.

Expect to bring in a picnic lunch, or you can pick up an already-made sandwich when you land. There are restaurants, but read their reviews carefully. The main attraction of this island is it's natural beauty. You'll enjoy the walk through the forest, and the best day swimming if you find a secluded spot on the shore between the two islands.","Written June 10, 2016"
France,Iles de Lerins,Enjoyable walk round the island,"The price of the 15-minute boat crossing (14 euros return) is a bit steep, but unless you have your own yacht or fancy swimming from Cannes you don't have much choice. Looks like all the boat companies collaborate to some extent to ensure that no-one could ever be left on the island, even in high summer when there are masses of people expecting to return to Cannes late in the afternoon. Perhaps the EU anti-cartel bureau (if there is such a thing) would care to investigate whether there is free and fair competition here.

Anyway, I digress. We walked around the whole island, and it didn't seem as much as 5 miles (as stated). It's flat (kinda obviously) and there are plenty of little stony beaches but no sand. Jellyfish were in evidence on the day we went there, so swimming wasn't an option. There are some great views to other smaller islands and back to the mainland, and much of the walk is in shade.

Best to take your own refreshments, although there are some food/drink outlets there (I suspect their charges reflect the fact they have a captive clientele). Also: no smoking on the island due to fire risk (they ought to announce that on the boat too).

As others have indicated, it probably gets unpleasantly crowded in high season, although many people can't be bothered to walk more than 500 metres from the landing stage...","Written June 3, 2016"

I took the slope as I was with some people who preferred that so I cannot verify the count of the stair climb, though we did cross them. The museum is very well done, giving a great perspective on the shipping around the island and the settlement of it. The prison where the Man in the Iron Mask, an Irish soldier, sundry Moorish nobles and their families, and 6 Huguenot protestants were confined makes up the other half of the museum.

The island is very nice for walking and having a nice view of Cannes from sea view. The fort is nice even though you do not have so much to see in there. An expo or two and the possibility to see the ancient jail where the legendary ""masque de fer"" was kept for many years. Despite that, not so much more. In fact be very careful with food there as the prices are outrageous. You pay more or less double price than in a similar restaurant in Cannes.

France,Iles de Lerins,A peaceful and secluded morning trip from busy Cannes,"I love it here! I was in Cannes for the day and wanted to see Ile Sainte-Marguerite before I visited the shops in the afternoon. I paid around 10 euros (return) for a 9am boat from the port, which arrived at the Island about 15 minutes later. I would have probably paid for just the boat journey alone it was so good. I could see helicopters taking off from the helipads, fish in the clear waters etc.

When I arrived I was shocked at how quiet the place was, as a tourist destination I was so surprised that hardly anybody was here. I couldn't work out where to go as I couldn't see people. I just followed my nose and stumbled across a quiet beach with crystal clear waters. There were quite a lot of jelly fish in the water so be careful, and I came back with lots of spider/ant bites from the sand so bring lots of towels.

There is a museum here which is just ok, but I wasn't here for that. There are a couple of bars/restaurants and one or two sandwich huts.

I will definitely come here again, a great morning or afternoon out.","Written September 7, 2015"

France,Iles de Lerins,Ile St Honorat - the smaller of the two Iles des Lerins,"Having been to Ile Sainte Marguerite a year or so ago, and loved the peacefulness of the island during the high season, we decided to explore the other smaller island of Ile St Honorat this year.
The boats to this island only leave from the port of Cannes (whereas you can get boats to St Marguerite from Cannes, Golfe-Juan and Juan les Pins), and the trip costs just over 16 euros - but this includes a fee to the monks for visiting the island.
We took a small picnic and allowed time to walk all around the island (it is only 1.5 kilometres long by 400 metres wide). As we ate our lunch we overlooked the sheltered water between the two island of the Lerins, and gazed rather jealously at people with their own boats who were able to swim in the crystal clear water.
The church at the Abbaye is open to visitors, although the little chapels dotted around the island are closed. The most interesting thing there is the Fortified Monastery, which dates back to the 15th century, and has lovely views over the island once you have climbed the spiral staircase to the top.
It is worth walking through the centre of the island to see the vineyards tended by the monks. They make (and sell in the shop) a number of wines, but we considered them a touch too expensive, especially as we couldn't do a tasting of them.
We had a very enjoyable day, away from the crowds of the Cote d'Azur, and steeped in the history of an island that has been a home to monks for 16 centuries.
One word of caution - although there are toilets on the island (very close to the quay where the boat docks, and nowhere else), they are very rudimentary 'squatting' toilets.",

France,Iles de Lerins,"Pretty spot, great snorkeling and light hiking","We visited St. Marguerite in early June, a short 15 minute boat ride from the Cannes port (boats run every hour to/from the island on the half hour and round trip is $13.50 per person). Overall, it was a very enjoyable afternoon. You get to see Cannes and the adjoining coast from the water and take in some great views and pictures. The island itself is very pretty, but as some reviewers have stated, nothing mind blowing. We specifically wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle, so it was a perfect choice for us.

The 'hiking' (I would probably call it 'active walking,' doesn't quite qualify for a 'hike' in my book) was very relaxing and peaceful. There are many paths to wonder through - pine, magnolia and other trees, with some really thick forest in parts. A few spots have some steep areas to climb, but these are very few and if you are in okay walking shape that should not pose any problems. The flora and fauna was pretty and relaxing, though probably not anything you haven't already seen before if you've been outdoors in a moderate climate.

The highlight for me was snorkeling in crystal clear water on the side opposite where the boat drops you off. It is not really a beach, but a rocky area with steps. We only met a few other people there making for plenty of space for all of us. I saw at least 5 different types of fish schooling there, and the water was warm enough to enjoy staying in the water for at least 15-20 minutes at a time for me. If you go in the water definitely wear shoes though!","Written June 3, 2015"

France,Iles de Lerins,"Outstanding day trip, each island is worth a visit","Both islands have their merits and each is worth a visit any time of year as long as the sea is calm (which is most of the time). The ferry only takes around half an hour to forty minutes and is good value. Do look out if you are parking near the terminal as I've seen car after car with a ticket at the end of the afternoon, if it says pay, you better had.

My main tip for the islands is go early, that way you will get a free parking spot not too far away along the front between Cannes and Mandelieu and above all you will get on the islands before they get busy, which is when they are at their best. We got the first boat on both occasions and were really glad we did.

Ste Marguerite is great for walking as its a decent size and the chateau museum visit very good, both pretty and interesting with a good story to go with it. Snorkelling is not bad, above all it gives you a chance to cool off as it does get pretty hot as the day goes on.

St Honorat is smaller and we didn't stay as long. The fort is very beautiful and the abbey is interesting too. Good swimming though tricky getting in and one cut a foot as not wearing protection.

If you are swimming it is worth having protection on your feet as it is very easy to get cut on the sharp rocks, that goes for both islands.

If there is a down side it is the boats all around which gets a bit much in July and August (not so bad in other months), also when it start to get busy as people arrive and as it starts to get hot. There is plenty of shade though (take plenty of water).

The upside is considerable as we were the only people by the sea on Honorat in peak season, whereas the beach in Cannes was already busy when we departed.

So I suggest you make it an early morning to mid afternoon jaunt. A lovely experience.",

France,Iles de Lerins,Fantastic/magnifique,"One doesn't go to this island to sunbath, nor is it particularly suitable for a long, relaxing picnic. It can be hot, it can be dusty and it can be windy.

However, this is an island stepped in history and natural beauty, and for that alone it is well worth visiting.

From the medieval monastery to the more modern Abbaye, admire the religious community that has existed here since the 4th century, almost self sufficient in their needs.

There is beauty, exotic plants and wildlife, but unfortunately there are also signs of a more evil, modern period in the shape of the pillboxes and bunkers erected by the German army during the Occupation of the 1940s.

And yes, it can get busy with tourists and the boat fare isn't cheap and queues can form in the small shops, but don't let that put you off. This is an island well-worth visiting.

A little advice: buy your food in the March√© Forville and bring it with you along with 2 litres of water, and try to arrive on the island before the sun is at it strongest. The wine produced by the Abbaye is fantastic, but very expensive.",

If you are mosquito-bothered, beware the cafe/restaurant area - it seems to be plagued by aggressive mosquitos, so spray liberally if you are liable to suffer from biting.

France,Iles de Lerins,Fantastic,"I have recently been to both of the Lerins Islands and enjoyed them both very much. Fantastic views in peaceful surroundings, very enjoyable! I bought both of my tickets online and saved roughly ‚Ç¨2 per trip, and was sent a e-ticket via email which I presented upon boarding with no problems.
I would advise a packed lunch on St Honorat, as the one restaurant seemed very pricey and extremely busy, although beautifully located overlooking crystal clear waters. There was a snack bar but it didn't seem have much left by mid afternoon.
St Marguerite had two restaurants, I didn't look but I assume pricey also (but smelling delicious!). There were also two snack bars for sandwiches/ice creams/drinks.

Worth paying extra for the museum/keep on both islands, the views from the top were out of this world and you will be sure to get some great pics.

North well worth a visit when staying in Cannes. Highly recommended.","Written August 31, 2014"
France,Iles de Lerins,Fabulous,"Enchanting little island lost in time, be sure to bring your own map or a GPS as it's a bit easy to get lost there, unless that is your intent. The wine is only so so on Munk's Island, not entirely worth the 25 euro bottle price tag, but perhaps the margin for price. Best bring a picnic, very pricey.","Written August 27, 2014"

The short sea ride is nice, the island beautiful, the fort well preserved and with interesting history as well as stunning views. The fort is a short walk from the port. I wish we had more time to visit the rest of the island.

France,Iles de Lerins,Ile Saint-Honorat,"Spent the day there - the ferry ride over it was POURING rain, and so we grabbed some (very expensive) tea in the restaurant while we waited for the rain to die down.

Once the rain was gone, we saw the amazing tranquility and beauty of this island. Truly incredible. We wandered around, through the old ruins, and along the rocky coast. Some of the most gorgeous scenery I've ever seen.

The monks produce lots of lovely products for sale, and we would've loved to try some of their wine, but it was simply too far out of our price range, starting at about 25 euro. As much as I'd like to support the Abbey, that's nearly $40 CDN. Either way, remarkable place. Would definitely go again.","Written August 15, 2014"

France,Iles de Lerins,Island hop,We had an enjoyable and energetic day on Ile Sainte Marguerite. The old fort and museum was certainly worth the trip over. The food was OK if a little expensive. I was surprised at a comment read before we went that they couldn't find the beach. It was pretty self evident but sadly having read that comment we had not brought our costumes. As well as the sandy beach there were places where it is possible to swim off the rocks. Well worth a visit.,"Written August 12, 2014"
France,Iles de Lerins,Nice walks,"This is a nice change from Cannes - Nice walks in relatively fresh air for the season.. However, the beaches are almost as busy as the ones in Cannes, and lots of rocks, so don't expect to find a ""secret spot"" for the day. Also, make sure you bring your own foodd. The restaurants there are super expensive. Good food, but definitely not worth the price - a minuscule salad for 25 Euros is exagerated!

France,Iles de Lerins,Get your tranquil on!,"After a busy day in Cannes, shopping and sightseeing, take a quick ferry to Isle St. Honorat and get your tranquil on.
This beautiful island has been home for 16 centuries to the monks of L√©rins Abbey, respecting the rule of St. Benedict based on prayer and work.
The island is stunning!! Vineyards sprawl through the interior, and churches, fortresses, abbeys, forests, turquoise water, and magnificent views hug the coastline. Circumnavigate in silence - broken only by sounds of the sea, the trees, birds - then sit in silence at the church.
After exploring the island and before heading back, sit in a eucalyptus grove at the restaurant and taste the St Honorat 2010 (best red so far - cherries, earth, silence) & St. Sauveur 2010 (Hallelujah, there IS a god!) These Benedictine monks know how to make wine!!","Written July 16, 2014"

France,Iles de Lerins,Happy and quiet Island,"just in front of Cannes, 2 tiny Island, well maintained in which you can walk along drill path as well as swim in a blue water. just one smalll issue: too many boat in the middle of the island so it is better to go far from the port on the south east side of the island.",
France,Iles de Lerins,Great place to visit while in Cannes,"We were there on May 2014.

We were on a cruise that tendered in Cannes so we tried to get off the ship as soon as possible to avoid the crowd and take the first ferry available for Ste-Marguerite. You can buy your ticket in advance online for 11 Euro/pers round-trip.

The boat ride is about 15-20 minutes. I suggest you go to the top floor of the boat for a great view of Cannes.

When we got to the island we decided to start our visit by the Fort Royal and the museum. It is just a short walk from the pier and the path is nice. It cost 6 Euro/pers to visit the fort/museum. There is not much to see but it is still interesting and worth it. It took us about 30-45 minutes to visit. There are also some great photo spots from inside the fort.

After that, we took the ""All√©e des Eucalyptus"" to reach the South side of the island. We loved that scented path, it is gorgeous. And when you reach the South side you have a nice view of St Honorat island.

Then we followed the ocean side going west to the point of the island where you can see a cannon ball oven. We then headed North/East to go back to the ferry, visiting ""L'√©tang du Bat√©guier"" on the way.

All in all we spend a little over 2 hours on the island and we really appreciated this beautiful place. Having spent some time in Cannes later that day we realized that we enjoyed our time on the island a lot more than the time spent in Cannes. We preferred the natural wonders of the island to the shops and crowd of Cannes.

If we ever go back, we will adjust our schedule to spend more time in Ste Marguerite and we will make some time to visit St Honorat too.

I would definitely recommend a visit to Ste Marguerite.",
France,Iles de Lerins,FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD,"Have been here several times sailing from La Napole. Almost empty boat, great trip. Superb views of coast line, mountains ,boats. Air clean and fresh , nice walks along shady paths. Climb up to the fort it is worth a visit. The restaurant below the fort used to be great, good food great prices...it's now been tarted up and the prices have rocketed . We ate at the other one in the village. Tip book when you first pass by it , locals all come out for lunch.

France,Iles de Lerins,"For nature lovers, but it is overgrown and a bit run down","A nice 15 minute boat ride gets you to Ile Ste Marguerite from Cannes. Boats run at regular intervals. It seems to have much to offer, but in the heat, walking was difficult, so we had to settle on seeing less. Many buildings are in disrpeair or hoarded up, which is a pity. We ate at the main restaurant (L'Escale) which was OK - I had 10 sardines and many chips/fries on my plate of 'sardines frites"".

Overall, an interesting place with upward potential.","Written June 8, 2014"
France,Iles de Lerins,Take a picnic and enjoy the peace,"Visited Ste-Marguerite with my family on a beautiful sunny day and our only regret is we never bought a picnic with us as there are loads of lovely spots for a picnic (and a glass of wine maybe)
We drove from Nice and parked in the port car park arriving about 10.30 and there were loads of spaces, this is a very short walk to ticket office and departure point (tickets ‚Ç¨13 for adults, ‚Ç¨12 for students/seniors)
After an enjoyable short boat trip we started our walk, first stop was the fort, entry to this is ‚Ç¨6 and we spent less than an hour in it so quite pricey for a large group.
Then we followed the coast road to the other end of the island and saw very few people on the way, then returned to the harbour down the central road.
Overall we were there approximately 3¬Ω hours, could easily have stayed longer if only we'd brought the picnic....","Written June 1, 2014"
France,Iles de Lerins,lovely boat trip from Cannes,"These two islands make a nice day trip out from Cannes and both have a very different feel.
Ile Sainte Marguerite is bigger and feels more wild, you can hike around the inland pathways or pick your way around the shores. If you're feeling rich you can eat at La Guerite restaurant - main courses start at ‚Ç¨25.
Ile Saint-honorat is smaller and privately owned by monks and is mainly given over to vineyards which are worked by the monks. You can visit the church and try their wine (by the bottle) in the restaurant. It's really easy to walk all around the island and the monastic buildings are really pretty.
You can't visit both on the same boat trip as the boat services only go from Cannes-ISM or Cannes-ISH. it's about ‚Ç¨15 return to each island from Cannes for an adult. The boat takes about 15-20 minutes each way + you buy your tickets at the south-east corner of the old port (you'll see signs near the radisson hotel)","Written May 30, 2014"

The boat departs from the quai at the very end of La Croisette. A lovely peaceful place away from the busy holiday atmosphere of Cannes. Well worth a visit to take some time out to explore the monastic ruins and indeed some of the modern monastery areas which are open to the public. There is a small snack bar and a fancier restaurant for those who would like to eat something more substantial. A pleasant place to spend a few hours in undisturbed tranquility.","Written May 28, 2014"

The fragrance of lavender adds to the charm. Don't expect to find an array of shops or restaurants, there's one quaint shop to browse or buy a snack or drink but the charm of the island is it's peacefulness and beauty.

France,Iles de Lerins,Seeking the Man in the Iron Mask,"What a joyful day I had, with the island of Sainte Marguerite almost to myself. The weather had been amazingly bad for the week of my stay in Cannes, a place with 360 days of sunshine a year, allegedly. On my last full day, the sun came out as I paid my 10 euros for a return trip to a magical place just offshore the hustle and bustle of rich, disdainful, bourgeois Cannes.

I had planned to also visit the other, smaller island of Ile Saint Honorat, which houses a working monastery of Cistertian monks, who make their living from wine production on the island. A section of the island is dedicated to silent prayer. Loud tourists beware! Anyhow, I was so entranced by l'Ie Sainte Marguerite that I never had the chance to get there. I'm definitely coming back to experience it. Maybe even stay there for a spiritual retreat. See : http://www.abbayedelerins.com/lhospitalite/hotellerie/

So, I landed on Ile Sainte Marguerite on the first boat of the day, which is not too early in Winter, being at 08h00. I was the only passenger that day. I then clambered all over the coastline, below the fortress where Dumas historically real character was interned, visited the cemetery of algerian rebels interned on the island and wandered through the forest. I discovered a furnace for heating cannonballs used by the batteries to fire red-hot shot at incoming enemy sailing ships and watched the surf crash on the beach opposite the monastery on the smaller island.

On this winter visit, the restaurant was closed and there were no kinds of commerce open, so I couldn't have spent money on anything, therefore the cost of this whole, marvelous day was 10 euros. But take water and a sandwich with you if you go out of season.

It was a sublimely peaceful, isolated, spiritual and happy day.",
France,Iles de Lerins,"Wonderful, but busy in July or August!","Two beautiful islands just ten minutes by boat from Cannes. Lovely ,unspoilt and a real unspoilt oasis.

France,Iles de Lerins,Wonderful little isle!,"I had a picnic here and spent the day exploring the whole island which is walk-able over a few hours stroll. There we saw some washed up sea creatures and wild cats along with an old fort. This is also where the famous prisoner ""the Man in the Iron Mask"" was held captive living in the former Fort Royal that was transformed into a prison.

We visited the Fort Royal where the Masque de Fer was incarcerated for 11 years before being transferred to the Bastille in Paris. Interesting and powerful wall paintings by Jean Le Gac, can nowadays be found in some cells. Walking in the old village of the island is a real pleasure. It is full of treasures: an old chapel dating from the XVII century, an old barracks which is now used for school field work, 2 beautiful wells, some charming fountains, without forgetting the picturesque small streets. There are various eating facilities on the island around the the mini port, from snack bars to one restaurant, l'Escale where we had a delicious and copious lunch. Altogether this is an island well worth visiting while on the Cote d'Azur.",

Snacks are available and there is plenty of room and picnic benches to enjoy the view on Ste Marguerite and on Cannes. The views from the castle are beautiful. Forget the locally produced wine : it's either frightfully good or too expensive at more than 50 eur/bottle. There was no way to taste it so you had to have faith on the label.

Such a massive space, designed and built centuries ago. The stained glass, including rose window, are fantastic. One small thing I thought was clever is that they had card machines to pay for votives, so if you don't have 2, or 5, or 10 euro cash on you, you can still purchase.

If you have the stamina (and not a severe fear of heights), I recommend doing the tower climb. It is not free (I think it was 8 euro maybe), and be prepared for a line especially if you are there on a weekend, but the views from the top, and getting to see the cathedral from such a different perspective is worth it.

France,Cathedrale Notre Dame de Strasbourg,Beautiful and Historic Cathedral,"When we first arrived at the side of the cathedral, we were impressed with the cathedral‚Äôs very tall tower, pinkish sandstone walls, huge copper roofed nave surrounded by ornate mini-towers. The exterior of the cathedral reminded me of the roofline of Speyer Cathedral, a Romanesque cathedral in Speyer, Germany. Once inside the cathedral, we saw the beautiful and ornate nave with vaulted ceiling and heavy stone columns. The interior gave us a feel of mixture of Romanesque and Gothic architecture. We were very impressed with unusually ornate pipe organs mounted on both side-walls as well as beautiful stained glass windows on all the walls. This cathedral‚Äôs interior was definitely different from that of Speyer Cathedral which was much simpler and stoic interior. Like City of Speyer, City of Strasbourg had changed hands multiple times between France and Germany in the past, resulting in a fusion of Romanesque and Gothic architectural characteristics in the Strasbourg cathedral. During WWII, Hitler seemed to have considered turning the cathedral into a monument to the Unknown German Soldiers. Ironically, however, we saw that a stone column inside the cathedral‚Äôs nave has been turned into a memorial for U.S. soldiers with big inscription ‚Äú1944-1945 In Memory of the American Officers Non Commissioned Officers Soldiers Who Gave Their Life to Free Alsace‚Äù. The huge astronomical clock in the nave had highly sophisticated features. This cathedral is a must visit attraction.",

France,Cathedrale Notre Dame de Strasbourg,Definitely worth seeing and one of the highlights of Strasbourg,"The Cath√©drale Notre-Dame de Strasbourg is a very beautiful building and definitely the highlight of the city alongside the European Parliament Strasbourg, the Parc de l'Orangerie and the Palais de Rohan.

The Cath√©drale Notre-Dame de Strasbourg is one of the largest sandstone buildings in the world. Admission to the church is free. However, a visit to the observation deck for ‚Ç¨ 5 for students, or ‚Ç¨ 8 regularly. The climb is difficult.
His most famous pieces of equipment inside the cathedral include the astronomical clock, the pulpit, the baptismal font, the ""angel pillar"" in front of the astronomical clock, the glass windows, or the Silbermann organ.

The building reflects Romanesque, Gothic and highly Gothic style elements. The 140 m high tower, the main facade with the portal statues and the rose window with a diameter of 15 m are impressive and worth seeing. Due to the small space in front of the church and the size of the building, a wide-angle lens is necessary for photos.
The cathedral also looks beautiful in the evening and at night when it is illuminated by the spotlights.",

France,Cathedrale Notre Dame de Strasbourg,STRASBOURG CATHEDRAL AMAZING - MY RIVER CRUISE WHICH BROUGHT ME THERE WAS NOT,"RIVER CRUISE TRAVELERS ‚Äì BEWARE

I took a Rhine River Cruise this year which turned out to be a terrible disappointment to me. I had only heard raving reviews from everyone I knew who had ever taken a river cruise. The excursions on this particular cruise line were exceptionally grueling with limited excursion choices.

The choices offered by this cruise line were walking, hiking or biking. These choices only became apparent after paying for the cruise. There were 14 of us in our group and after the first few days when the level of difficulty became apparent, seven from our group were not able to go out every day. The walking tours were between 3 and 4 hours long, with very minimal seating available.

Upon returning from my trip, I researched other river cruise lines and discovered that other cruise companies offer a wider variety of excursions. While there might be a few 3-4 hour tours, tours of 1-2 hours are also available. With shorter tours available, other options can be enjoyed on the same day.

For example, In Trier some companies offer you short tours in the morning which gives you an opportunity to take another tour in the afternoon one of which can be a bus trip to into Luxembourg.

Someone who had recently taken the same trip with another company got to the the Tijksmuseum which houses the works of Rembrandt and Vermeer and other great artists. She couldn‚Äôt believe that I never even saw a windmill.

The Strasbourg Cathedral in France is an outstanding example of Gothic/Romanesque architecture and certainly worth seeing. So if you do get to Strasbourg,France my all means visit the cathedral and its amazing astronomical clock.

Bottom Line though is: If you are taking a European River Cruise, do your homework, I only wish I had.","Written January 20, 2020"

A security person checks the bags of those entering the church, but from then on it's yours to explore and go ""wow"" at every statue, icon, ornament and stained glass window. The building seems to be a mix of a museum, an art gallery and the Sistine chapel, decorated in gold to illustrate and reinforce the faith of those who so long ago came here to worship. Of course it is still an active place of worship so respect needs to be shown to those who attend as well as the equipment there.

One queue around the front was to enter the church for no charge, the other queue around the side cost 8 euro and was to walk up the tower. We got in the wrong queue and ended up paying 8 euro and climbing the tower. It was well worth it, the view was amazing as was the sense of achievement for making it up all those stairs.

France,Cathedrale Notre Dame de Strasbourg,The pink cathedral,"The Cath√©drale de N√¥tre Dame de Strasbourg is #36 on the list of the world‚Äôs largest churches. It is also considered one of the top Gothic churches in the world, although this isn‚Äôt completely accurate as a large section of the apse and North fa√ßade is Romanesque. And in case you‚Äôre wondering about the difference, Romanesque is about walls and Gothic is about windows.
The earlier Carolingian church of the 9th century caught fire several times and in the year 1015 a Hapsburg bishop began construction of a new Romanesque style cathedral much in fashion at the time. But that one burned in 1156 and the Bishop planned to build a church even more beautiful than the newly completed cathedral in rival city Basel (Switzerland).
But that didn‚Äôt last long because the new Gothic style of construction came in 1225 from Chartres which added more light with stained glass windows. Incredibly expensive, the new cathedral was paid for with ‚Äúindulgences‚Äù which meant the more money you gave the shorter your time in Purgatory. God loves a big giver!
The stone came from the nearby Vosges Mountains and is uniquely pink or rose. The West fa√ßade has thousands of carved figures representing probably every Saint known to the Catholic world. No one can identify them all. But with so many windows possible between the fragile stone walls held up by flying buttresses there are over 30 amazing stained glass works of art plus a massive rose window on the West face.
This was an important church within the realm of the Holy Roman Empire. Five of the windows depict 15 Holy Roman Emperors. The North tower was the tallest structure in the world for 227 years. It is still awesome. Although it isn‚Äôt one of my favorite churches it is certainly worth a long visit.",

The exterior is certainly impressive and it is matched by the interior which includes the astronomical clock,the organ and the magnificent rose window. It is modelled on Chartres in Paris and built of red sandstone from the Voges mountains which gives its distinctive pinky red colour.

Allow time here because there is so much to see and admire. Buy a guide book to understand how the architectural styles changed over time and the significance of much of the carving and the stories in the beautiful stained glass windows.
wait for the astronomical clock to chime if you can at 12.30 and admire the wonders of this magnificent mechancial timepiece.

France,Cathedrale Notre Dame de Strasbourg,One of Europe's Most Impressive Cathedrals,"Honestly, I'm not sure how you could go to Strasbourg and NOT visit the cathedral, but just in case you were on the fence:

This is one of the most imposing cathedrals in Europe. For centuries it was the tallest building in the world, and the vertical effect is absolutely stunning in person - pictures don't do it justice. Approach along the Rue Merciere for the best impression.

Be aware that the cathedral is periodically closed to allow the celebration of Mass without interruption from tourists, and then subsequently reopened.

The cathedral can get a bit crowded, given its popularity. The astronomical clock is certainly worth a view, but it is tucked away in a corner which gets very crowded when the clock is about to strike.

I would also recommend paying the extra fee to climb to the top. It is a long, winding climb, but you are rewarded with a wide open space and a good view. Don't miss the centuries of graffiti on the walls outside. Better still, the original treadwheel crane used to build the cathedral is still up there, and can be seen.","Written September 14, 2019"
France,Cathedrale Notre Dame de Strasbourg,Impressive,"Going inside the Cathedral is a must if you are visiting Strasbourg. Among other things you can admire inside the cathedral is the amazing astronomical clock. At 12.30pm everyday you can visit the astronomical clock and watch the Apostle's Parade. If you buy the Strasbourg Card watching the Apostles Parade is free.
If you are fit you can venture upwards to the Platform of the Cathedral and see Strasbourg from a birds eye view (66 metres). However keep in mind that going up to the Platform requires that you climb 332 steps. Again, if you have the Strasbourg Card going up to the Platform is free.
The Cathedral is an amazing work of art and it should definetelly be on your list if you are planning to travel to Strasbourg.","Written September 14, 2019"

France,Cathedrale Notre Dame de Strasbourg,Strasbourg's #1 landmark & attraction...,"This Cathedral's construction dates back about 1,000 years, and it was completed in ""a mere"" 430 years-- about 580 years ago! While huge, and very tall [it was the tallest building in the world for about 224 years], many aspects of its facade's design include very fine/detailed aspects, while reflecting its Gothic and Romanesque character. The site was previously used for ""other religious"" buildings. It has been selected by travellers like you and I as the #1 attraction in Strasbourg. Also, TripAdvisor has awarded it the impressive ""Traveller's Choice"" designation. It is definitely worthy of a visit as there is so much of its history reflected both outside and inside the Cathedral.

Each part relates to every part of our world and solar system. Words cannot describe an experience. you HAVE to see it for yourself.

The surroundings of Place de la Cath√©drale is always full of people mainly from across Europe since Strasbourg is just 25km from Germany and not too far either from Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The entrances to this Cathedrale isn‚Äôt hard because the Q clearance is speedy fast and made my day here worth every seconds. Some people just have no patience to Q haha...well everything before your eyes is just stunningly beautiful from the top to bottom. While you‚Äôre inside nothing else matters except appreciating the masterpiece of art from 13th centuries when Strasbourg was still under the hands of Germanic-Frank before it becomes France.
The ceilings reaches about fifty over meters high and entrances alone are full with thousands of statuette artworks and interiors are absolute wonders. Erwin Von Steinbach was the geniuses mind crafters of this Cath√©drale. man He created such a brilliant handwork during his time comparison to ours. The most popular sights is the huge tall Clock house that every one is waiting for. There‚Äôs another underlying pavement see-through from the corner floor in between the souvenir counter and the clockworks you‚Äôll see thousands of schilling coins and multi currency bill notes from well wishers.

France,Cathedrale Notre Dame de Strasbourg,Mixed Feelings,"My husband and 9 y/o son went up the tower, but my knee was bothering me so I skipped that and just went inside. They said the views from the top were worth the cost and that the stairs weren't too much. I knew it was supposed to be free to go in, but there were people lined up further down from the entrance to the tower so I went and lined up with everyone else to go inside. I saw a sign that said something about a film at 12 and it was about 11:30 at the time. I got to the front and there was a 3 Euro fee to get in, I tried to clarify what the cost was for, but wasn't really given an answer so paid and went in. The cathedral itself was average for cathedrals. Possibly it had more stained glass than I have ever seen in one cathedral. I was then semi-trapped in the Cathedral until the 30 minute video was done that was mainly about the clock that you could not view until the video was done. All in all, my experience was not great because I was just expecting to walk and then walk out at my leisure and I didn't realize I was just waiting through the video to see a clock. Just make sure if you don't care about that you go either before or after the film.","Written August 10, 2019"

It's beautifully laid out with sculptures and objects of interest among some wonderful planting, some more formal than others. Several ponds and water features add further interest. Sadly it was too hot to consider a trip around the glasshouses but they are spectacular even to look at from the outside. There is an area of trial and experimental plots at the top of the gardens which was very interesting - growing vines without pesticides and studying habitats for pitcher plants, plus a slightly bonkers exhibit (tends to be a theme in Nantes!) measuring the weight increase of a pumpkin in the orangery by how much it will cause a cart to run down a slope! Lots of fun for kids too with the topiary cat, exotic waterfowl to spot, paddling pool, giant flowerpots, playground etc. Full marks for the very clean (unisex) loos and a drinking water point to fill your own water bottle. The cafe looked lovely but again too hot to tempt us, but we did hang around for the ice cream seller to start trading again after lunch - gorgeous sorbets.

France,Jardin des Plantes,Calm in the middle of the storm,Situated right outside of the North side of the train station in Nantes is the Jardin des Plantes. Given the hussle and bustle that happens around the train station with people hanging around and running to catch trams it's nice to have someplace that's just calm. There's a merry go around just to the right inside not to mention a little area with Goats (sometimes kids as well depending on the time of the year) Towards the back of the gardin you've got a play area for kids not to mention an area of grass where you can relax a bit and have a picnic if that's your kind of thing. The big downside as I see it ... especially if you've got kids with you is that you're not allowed to walk on the grass. It's not the end of the world and there are a number of installations on display that are quite nice (again depending on the time of the year) All in all if you've in the area .. and looking to chill out I'd recommend a trip here.,"Written March 14, 2017"

The collection of paintings was impressive and representative for all the Picasso's artistic path. There was really lots od people in the afternoon, which was not very comfortable but the exhibition was worth seeing, even for non specialists in art as everything was explained.

France,Musee Fabre,A Journey through the history of painting,"Musee Fabre is one of the most important French museums and my expectations were quite high. It has been improved and restructured over the past years and now offers a quite extensive collection of art from the Renaissance to contemporary art. √Ä regular ticket is 8 Euro and for the lockers you need 1 Euro. The cashier was very helpful with that.
The first room you enter is a very modern feature catering to the needs of children but basically offering a new approach to art to all visitors: You can walk through that area experiencing sculptures with your hands. You can even take it one step further by putting on a mask supplied by the museum and trying to imagine how a blind person would experience art - very cool! The idea of how a blind person would experience art is a topic which repeated in the exhibition. In most rooms there is a set of three framed images: One shows the portrait of a blind person, the second presents a quotation of that same person and the third shows an Image that is inspired by the quotation. These displays are all very touching and add depth and an unexpected new layer to the visual enjoyment.
All together the path through the rooms offers more or less a chronological journey. The works are by French artists but also by Flemish, Belgian etc. masters. Among the works by less known artists there are some famous names like Breughel, Delacroix, Degas etc. Mostly these are less known works which makes them all the more charming. Imagine walking down a corridor with lots and lots of 19th portraits (very interesting but often rather stylised) only to be drawn in by the delicate sunlight caught in treetops... of an enchanting landscape by Delacroix! The chronological order also renders the development or evolution of painting - technique (exact details and brushstrokes versus dissolution of the same) and spatiality (viewing a painting in itself and in detail, close up and taking in the effect of modern art as occupying a space).
Sometimes it's difficult to figure out where to go next but there is always somebody there to help. All the personel was exceptionally friendly.
Before leaving you can peruse the extensive range of books and souvenirs in the museum book shop.

The building itself is amazing with lovely details and some mosaic floors.

Great museum for art lovers. For everybody else I recommend an audio guide or a tour (can't say anything about either though). The descriptions next to the paintings are in French but there are English and Spanish translations available in most rooms.","Written November 21, 2017"

France,Musee Fabre,We are so lucky to have a museum of this calibre on our doostep,We went to the Fabre museum to see the summer exhibition which is called Face to Face and features Francis Bacon and Bruce Nauman. We didn't like Francis Bacon's work before we went but went with an open mind. Sorry to Francis Bacon but we still don't like his work and find it very disturbing. We didn't like the work of Bruce Nauman either. But I am sure other people will have been thrilled. Works are on loan from several world museums There were plenty of people looking round. The Fabre is a wonderful regional museum and art is always a matter of personal taste! The exhibition was run as part of the Centre Pompidou's 40th Birthday celebrations.,"Written October 30, 2017"

France,Musee Fabre,H√¥tel Sabatier d'Espeyran - must see attraction,"I did not go into the main museum except to buy a ticket for the annexe a couple of hundred yards away around the corner - the splendid 19th century residence which is now combination of period house, modern art gallery, china collection and audio experience. I do not know why it does not have its own Trip Advisor entry as it is a self-contained experience but you can also buy a combination ticket. It is open in the afternoons only so check times carefully. You cannot buy a ticket at the entrance - you have to go to the main museum. Both sites are five minutes walk from the main square (Comedie) and about ten minutes from the main station. The ground floor is a collection of china - not especially interesting - but upstairs are beautifully restored period rooms from the aristocratic home of a local family in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The main rooms are lavish and impressive and full of works of art and curious features. There is minimal interpretation in English but there was some sort of audio playing - I have no idea what the content was but for those who are fluent in French it may be a major enhancement of the visitor experience. Montpellier is abit short of tourist attractions aside from the cityscape itself and so this is one not to miss if you are here. Useful brochures can be downloaded by searching for the site and adding pdf to the search term.",

A major theme was making the museum accessible to people with visual or hearing disabilities,which I think is very thoughtful and adds many insights for everybody.

Two of the guards on the main floor were exceptional. They not only guarded the exhibits, they were eager to share their ideas and knowledge. As a consequence,we learned that one painting was the first still life of Nature, and several other paintings were early examples of works that portrayed the poor and working people.
It's a beautiful old mansion too.","Written December 15, 2016"

It runs until 16th October every day except Mondays from 10.00 - 19.00. The entry price is ‚Ç¨10 and audio guides are available for ‚Ç¨3 We had never heard Fr√©d√©ric Bazille. He was born in Montpellier, the son of a prominent local family. They wanted him to do medicine and he went to Paris to do so. Before too long he wrote to his parents to tell them he'd given up medicine and was studying art. He was a close friend of Monet. Also in his circle of friends and acquaintances, Manet, Sisley, Renoir and other famous painters. These young artists were the instigators of impressionism. He enlisted to fight in the Franco Prussian war and sadly lost his life at the early age of 29. This probably accounts for the fact that he is not as well known as his contemporaries. We loved his work and the family paintings are wonderful. The lady's dresses are so beautiful. Having said that we enjoyed all his work! We were surprised to see so many of the other impressionists on display with many of them are on loan from galleries in the States. This is a wonderful exhibition and well worth the entry fee. It could be a once in a lifetime to see those paintings from the States! Do go and see it - the entry ticket also includes a visit to the almost next door Hotel Sabatier.",

We found it fascinating and educational. The exhibition was well planned and laid out. I'd recommend it if you are able to visit.

The floor plan can be a bit confusing as there are two buildings joined together and the levels don't correspond exactly, but you can get a plan, and in any case exploring is part of the fun. Some of the guards can be a bit over zealous, so don't get too close.

I can't pretend to know much about art, but I know a whole lot more after spending several hours viewing the Bazille exhibition and listening to the audio explanations.

There is an impressive exhibition of Bazille and his contemporaries running until 16 October. Highly recommended. However... It is always a thrill to discover a major new name in French art (to me that is) and I was bowled over by the new gallery spaces purpose built by the city to house the paintings of Pierre Soulage.

Not much early (ie pre Renaissance) material, but very good on the 18th and 19th centuries, and seeing all those gloomy landscapes and huge trophy pictures that were winners in the Academy salons helps show why the Impressionists were so radical and so threatening to the artistic establishment.

It holds quite a few pieces belonging to the Supports/Surfaces movement (Viallat, Dezeuze, Bioul√®s).

France,Musee Fabre,Well worth a visit,"This place is an extraordinary mixture of a top class international collection of some of the really big names of European Art combined with a nice, almost parochial, collection of pictures by local artists from Montpelier. Great Flemish and Dutch Genre collection. I have to admit to liking these a lot so I am biased. But spread throughout the rest of the Gallery are lovely isolated examples by great artists such as Veronese and Metsu and Zurbaran all the way up to Courbet, Monet and Renoir. There is one fascinating set of three pictures of a still life of a Heron and assorted dead birds.( I think that it is in Room 32 but I may be wrong) The one on the left is by Sisley. The one on the right , painted at the same time is by Bazille, a local artist. And the one in the middle is by Renoir and is a picture of Bazille painting his version of the heron. You almost feel that you are in the Studio with them as they labour away together. Lots of other lovely touches. The picture ''Good Morning M. Courbet'' has a picture of the man saying the Good Morning right beside it. He was a local collector named Bruyas who supported artists by having them paint portraits of him. The result is a large collection of pictures of the same frail red haired man right up to the point of his death.
This is not a quick visit place. If you like art you will find it hard to drag yourself away.
If you like Caravaggio take in the special exhibition as well.","Written September 17, 2015"

The Flemish and Dutch pieces are good, and the Salle Bazille does have some important Impressionist work. Aside from these .... not much of interest or importance. I was also struck by how poorly much of the work was displayed - particularly in terms of lighting. Light fixtures were directed at canvasses creating a horrible glare. Further, much of the sculpture was covered by a layer of dust. The staff seemed disinterested - ticket office did not offer any sort of gallery map or plan, and the bookstore attendant was too busy moving stock around to acknowledge our presence.

The whole exposition starts with oldest (and finest in my opinion) 16 and 17th century paintings and ends with 20th century modern art.

France,Musee Fabre,Impressive collection of paintings,"The Mus√©e Fabre has undergone a facelift to show off its impressive collection , dating from the 17th to the 20th century.

Housed in a series of galleries within a 17th C. Jesuit College, an 18th C. Hotel de Ville and 19th C. extensions, the building itself is quite impressive and the renovations are creative whilst respecting the original architecture.

The refreshingly impressive collection consists of old masters, modern movements, graphic arts and decorative arts.

The decorative arts section is housed across the street on two floors at the Hotel de Cabri√®res - Sabatier d'Espeyran. There are many fine pieces of furniture , paintings and objets d‚Äôart , typical of the luxurious life of a wealthy Montpellier family.

All in all, a very special way to spend an afternoon, and once I was done I walked across to the public park across the road to rest my weary legs.","Written July 9, 2014"
France,Musee Fabre,I need more time!,"I've been to Montpellier often, but never visited the art gallery (which is what it is) despite it being very conveniently situated on the edge of the Old Town and a few minutes from the principal shopping area. Old outside but new inside, the museum has been skilfully and lovingly set out. The 6 euros entrance ticket is a steal. There's almost too much there and it needs at least a couple of visits to do it justice. There are lots of good quality paintings by second rank painters (including the eponymous and philanthropic Mr Fabre), but there are some real gems dotted around, including three or four beautiful Monets (one of them exceptionally fine), a stunning, large Manet portrait, a beautiful Berthe Morisot and a charming early Reynolds (of Samuel praying) said possibly to be the oldest English artwork in France (obviously they don't do Holbein!). There's a large collection of Renaissance works of the 16th century, but the modern works are the highlight of the exhibition. There are some decent statues as well (including Degas). Staff, unusually, are polite, knowledgeable and helpful. Impressive!","Written July 8, 2014"

The museum is very clean and well staffed and they let you take pictures too!

But, it is largely of painters you may or may not recognize. Some, Metsu, Terrier are good and if the books or my Profs told me they were first rate I would have believed it. About 10 Courbets and Bazilles but not their best works. It was pleasant but nor up to the guidebooks ravings. Many large religious works done by people I did not know.","Written May 24, 2014"
France,Musee Fabre,Quite unexpected!,"Very large Arts museum with a huge range of high quality paintings and sculptures by well-known artists - also includes present day work.

France,Musee Fabre,Large but few well known artists,"This museum has been radically restructured with 9200 square metres of displays, including additional works by Francois-Xavier Fabre, Frederic Bazille, Simon Hantai and others. It reopened in 2007. The building is beautiful and the artworks well displayed, including some huge canvases.
There was a special exhibition of works by Francois-Andre Vincent (an artist between Fragonard and David), but the main museum is so vast that we did not have time to visit this. According to some guides there is a special programme for children to follow- this simply consists of a booklet of questions and puzzles ALL IN FRENCH (we had to translate for children). The most regrettable part for us was that so few of the artists were very well known and the few by artists such as Antoine COYPEL, Joshua REYNOLDS, and Claude MONET stood out as quality exhibits- particularly MONET'S Le jardin en fleurs a Sainte-Adresse. Good seating, but an exhausting museum - we spent a morning there -quite enough time.
Incidentally if you try to travel on ""Le Petit Train"" in Montpellier please note the ticket office closes well before departure time and the staff are rude,and uncaring , refusing to take a booking for seven although we were there at departure time - an unpleasant experience- Montpellier Tourist Office please note!","Written April 22, 2014"

France,Musee Fabre,"Great museum, great painters.","The museum itself is a bit of a maze -- it comprises two buildings, each built around a courtyard, with split levels. Fortunately one receives a small guide with a clear numbering of the rooms. Some of the halls are worth a visit in their own right (the Hall of Columns, the Hall of Griffons), while others are plain or even dark (to protect sensitive art). A great many famous painters are represented, though not always through famous works, which allows one to broaden one's knowledge and insight. One thing to be stressed is the presence of many beautiful sculptures, displayed so as to encourage their appreciation from different angles.","Written November 18, 2013"

France,Musee Fabre,Excellent current exhibition: Paul Signac,"Previous visits were most enjoyable so this time it was especially to view their current exhibition ""Signac The colours of Water"". This collection will remain until 27 October 2013. Ticket price of 9 euros includes the permanent collection of Musee Fabre and a reduction if visiting the exhibition in LODEVE. Celebrating the 150th anniversary of the birth of Paul Signac (1863 to 1935)...a founding member of the Neo-Impressionist Movement, he explored the infinite variations in water, the sky and light. Most famous for his paintings delivered in the ""pointillist"" manner, these have been gathered from many galleries world-wide do deliver a complete picture of Signac's work and his own travels. Good VFM for a most pleasant afternoon: the gallery was not too crowded so it was possible to enjoy every painting in an almost private way: not always the case with the ""blockbuster"" exhibitions that many travel miles to see.

France,Musee Fabre,Deceptively large,"The museum is set up in chronological order starting with the earliest pieces. You follow the proscribed route through time seeing how art changed over time. The museum has 52 (!) galleries. I was amazed at how large it is. It doesn't look that big from the street. The staff was very helpful. At one point one member started to speak to me in French, and when she realized I didn't understand took me to a bilingual staff member, who told me she was telling me that the museum went on through an opening at the end of a large gallery I was in. On another occasion, I asked the staff at the front desk about 4 closed galleries at the end of the museum, and the man went to pretty great lengths to a) understand what I was asking, and then b) without me prompting, made two phone calls to find out when the galleries would be re-opening. I didn't have the heart to tell him I was leaving the next morning, so unless it was later today, I was out of luck. But it was really nice of him to do all that for me. I was very impressed with the collection in the Fabre. I expected a small museum with a few interesting pieces, but it was a large collection with many interesting pieces.","Written July 5, 2013"

France,Musee Fabre,Pleasant enough to pass 90 minutes in but perhaps not essential,"To be honest this Art Gallery is so high on the list of 'Things To Do"" in Montpellier that I was a little disappointed - as were the two others who came around with me. Perhaps I have been spoilt by the London and Paris art galleries.
It certainly is a VERY ""varied and eclectic"" collection of art but too much renaissance and pre-Impressionist artworks for me. The extensive range of Dutch artists on the whole didn't do it for me neither did the Fabre paintings themselves. The directional signs are not good and the floors levels don't necessarily follow, its a bit of a maze. Hence I missed out on the later gallery of Monet/Sisley/Degas etc - and had to go back in again!
Pleasant enough to pass 90 minutes in but IMHO not essential if you have more of Montpellier you need to see.","Written June 24, 2013"

France,Musee Fabre,Well worth a visit,"A varied and ecclectic collection of art with something for everyone. We particularly enjoyed the extensive range by Dutch artists. Signage was not good and it was easy to get lost around the maze of corridors and interconnecting rooms. Am sure there was much we missed in this ""Tardis like"" building. Having recently undergone a major refurbishment it is a pity that this continues to be a problem. The dimly lit black interior Ladies loo was clearly designed by a male architect with much focus on style, with no thought on practicalities, eg for handbag hooks on doors or the need to see in mirrors!

As far as I am concerned the permanent exhibition of Pierre Soulages is what makes Musee Fabre a MUST SEE when you are in Montpellier and makes me give an Excellent rating.
The room where Soulages is exhibited as been made specially for his collection - the light falls on the paintings in a unique way. The paintings are gigantic and many of the monochrome.

France,Musee Fabre,a great place to visit,"The Mus√©e Fabre was wonderful. I wouldn't consider myself to be too much of an art-lover, but I'm mildly interested by it and wound up spending about four hours in the museum. Even though we bought a cheap ticket that only allowed us to see the permanent collection, there were several floors of art from several art periods and countries, including Flemish landscape paintings, Mannerist art, Classical and Neo-classical art, Impressionist paintings, and much more.

I would definitely recommend setting aside a few hours at least if you're planning on visiting, or else you'll be scrambling to see everything. I believe students enrolled in universities in Montpellier get free admission, and other students get a reduced tarif of 4‚Ç¨.","Written April 12, 2013"

So when we got there, so many people were up there it was over 3 hours before we could go down. And they would not let you down early.

France,Aiguille du Midi,Indian Family in French Town Chamonix,"It was a dream come true to see the Alps and its highest peak Mont Blanc in 2019 October just before Corona hit the world!

We walked till Trient in Switzerland, took a local bus (free of cost) to Argentiere and Vallorcine and hiked around to enjoy the natural beauty.

But after reaching there my son fainted for a while (acclimatization prob as after returning he was thoroughly checked with no prob. found) but we got very nervous and so I think O2 cylinder and doctor should be available up there and also intercom phones should be placed to call the officials at the spot for such emergencies. Thank God a group of Romanina girls came for help and to calm us down.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,A total must do during you Chamonix Trip,We really enjoyed our Trip to the Top of Aigille du Midi. We had a great weather and an amzing view and experience.

France,Aiguille du Midi,Aguile du Midi a dream come true!,"A cable car from Chamonix takes you to the beautiful Aguile du midi.
Snow and snow everywhere with the Chamonix city visible down amidst the clouds are a treat for the ice. You can experience into the void, a glass platform built on the mountain peak. Also you can see an unobstructed view of Mont Blanc.
It was time of covid hence most of the POIs were closed. Only Aguile du midi, into the void lift, mer de glace train was open. It coated around 67 euros for day pass covering these places. A must watch if you are in Chamonix.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Head spinning and breathless experience!,"A must-do whilst visiting Chamonix...
If you are not going to climb the Mont Blanc by foot, you minus well enjoy what modernity has to offer and take the 2 x gondolas up to l‚ÄôAiguille du midi to see the famous Mont Blanc.
We picked an absolutely gorgeous day and we were not disappointed.
Account for approx 2.5-3 hours all up. The trip itself is only 2 x 10 minutes gondolas, one that takes you up to the Plan de l‚ÄôAiguille (2317m) and the second up to l‚ÄôAiguille du midi (3777m).
Once at the top... enjoy the breathtaking views........
Beware! Being that high up means there is less oxygen so you can easily start experiencing head spinning. Make sure you drink water and take it slow.
Is is not recommended for children under 5 and not permitted for children under 3.
We saw quite a few people (small and big...) faint. So make sure you breathe properly.
There are a few things to do once at the top, and you can also enjoy lunch. There is a little cantine and a proper restaurant. Looked delicious (the restaurant) but we hadn‚Äôt booked and with covid at the moment, as it is a small restaurant, they can only accommodate for 4 tables, so be sure to book if you want to give it a go.
Make sure to get get the Mont Blanc multipass if you are also going to go to the Mer de Glace. Look up the details online but it‚Äôs worth it...",

France,Aiguille du Midi,Pay attention to wether conditions,"Nice place, but we were unlucky because of the weather conditions. It has no sense to go there when It is cloudy. The way back of 4 hours by foot was nice, but you have to be fit!

Chamonix is disappointing: the French people are quiet arrogant and snobbish, often treating you badly if you are a stranger, don‚Äôt want to speak English even if they understand it...

A bucket list experience of a lifetime! We were fortunate to have a beautiful cloudless day for the cable car ride to the top. Didn‚Äôt wait long (20 min) for the next cable car but indeed it was packed full. Everyone respectfully wears their mask but beyond that there were no health checks.

France,Aiguille du Midi,"Pricey, risky in Covid times, but amazing","The cable cars up to Aguille du Midi were rammed, shoulder to shoulder, but since new law on 20th July, everyone had masks on in the cable cars/gondolas/buildings.
We also thought the price was extortionate- ‚Ç¨201 for family, then another ‚Ç¨99 for the gondola across to Italy.
But we risked the crowd üò∑, blew the cash... and it is amazing up there.
The mid stage up the mountain has a bar/cafe, and trails leading out across, or up/down.
The top has a couple of exhibitions, another cafe, a busy glass box, the gondola across to Italy, and fantastic views.","Written July 29, 2020"
France,Aiguille du Midi,"Awesome attraction, but go with good weather and when the Covid-19 is gone!","It is definitely one of, or maybe the place to visit while in Chamonix. After all what you can see from the top is just amazing. There is a queue as expected so make sure you book in advance. You can probably go on a same day when you buy the ticket if you want to make sure the weather is great, but get ready to book the whole day since the time between buying the ticket and actually going up could be many hours. So, the views are great that's the good thing. The process of getting the ticket is very poorly organized so again, make sure you book in advance. On a busy Sunday when we took the journey, there was only one(!) person giving the boarding times for the people who had purchased their tickets online. So you can imagine the queues... And the one thing that was kind of annoying is the fact that they don't pay any respect towards the ongoing Covid-19 situation. Yes there are signs to wear mask and wash your hands, but the lifts are stuffed completely full with people with no safety distances in ques or inside lifts. I think everyone would understand reduced capacity at the moment.. In fact spending few days in Chamonix I noticed the locals don't care about the Covid either. Everyone acts like they haven't heard about safety distances, coughing towards you without masks etc. Typical French impoliteness. No wonder the country did so bad with the virus.. So if you decide to go to Aiguille du Midi, that's well worth the money but go when the Covid-19 is over if you want to play it safe.","Written July 15, 2020"

Also some good information in the facility at the top which provides detail about how/when it was built, it's uses, etc. Restaurant at the top is surprisingly affordable and has decent food with lots of options.

France,Aiguille du Midi,Spring skiing trip,The Aiguille du Midi cable car is the only one where you've got to get a plastic boarding pass as well as your chip skiing pass. They count you on that first cable car. Crampons are mandatory for anyone wishing to ski off the second cable car. I did it without a mountain guide but most people should pay for one. Do not pick a windy day to tackle the ar√™te at the beginning or a snowy day as you won't be able to see the crevasses. A sunny day a 2 days after a storm is ideal. You can get another cable car Punta Helbronner I think it was called across towards the Italian side of Mont Blanc above Courmayeur Italy. You can ski the Toula Glacier there. Most people will want to do the Vallee Blanche 20kms ski run down to the valley floor if you go all the way. Some guides will only take you part of the way down as far as the gondola up then the Montenevers train down. But that's not the full Vallee Blanche. Be ready for a steep climb out of the valley floor taking anything from 1 hour 10 minutes to 1.5 hours to do depending on your hiking fitness level. Skis on your rucksack hiking up towards the refreshment hut before continuing to ski all the way down to Les Planards Chamonix beginner area where it finishes. I did one ski run to the second cable car then that Vallee Blanche run to the bottom a full day of skiing. The skiing is advanced at the top but intermediate as you descend the pretty Glacier scenery. Be ready with water for that climb out take off your helmet to avoid excessive sweating something I didn't do and regretted. Only La Grave in France offers the same kind of wild off piste skiing as that cable car does. Your climbing experience needs to be better than your skiing. Remember for some of the steep lines you will need your own mountain ropes to lower yourself down when you get to points where it's too rocky to ski. Steep lines are best done with a guide as they are proper scary. Above all enjoy the experience.,
France,Aiguille du Midi,Oh. My. Gosh.,"You start from town, and they have a very nice housing for the telepherique, and a very organized system for taking people up. You take two different lifts up, and you should go as early as you can on a bluebird day. The views are amazing, breath-taking. The first thing we saw was an avalanche happening right before our eyes! The next thing that caught our attention was the line of skiers hiking down with crampons and ropes to start their adventures. That has got to be one of the scariest ski experiences ever! You must ski with a guide, don't try this by yourself!! The next thing I noticed was the ravens soaring and sitting on rocks up there, clinging on for dear life! It is such a high altitude that you don't want to spend a whole lot of time up there. But bring your best camera for sure. It was one of the most memorable things we did on our trip.","Written March 30, 2020"

France,Aiguille du Midi,Breath taking views,"We went at the end of ski season. The day was prefect. Clear blue sky and not too much wind. Our original travel plans were altered due to Covid-19 so we were not as prepared for the colder weather. Be sure to wear shoes that are warm, dry and have good traction. Hats, gloves, scarf and heavy coat if you are visiting during the winter months is a must if you want to enjoy the views. We did everything but the glacier tour because we arrived to late. We recommend getting getting the full pass so that you can ride the train as well. We did not ski and I am not sure that you could do ski and do everything in one day.
We thoroughly enjoyed our day. We didn‚Äôt spend any time in the shopping village but it looked very interesting but a bit expensive. You must pay for parking. There is a great little bar at the top that we enjoyed sitting outside with a beer (or coffee) and looking out over the mountain peaks.",

France,Aiguille du Midi,Amazing and the negative reviews are silly,"It's a cable car that takes you up from 1,000 to almost 4,000 metres facing Mont Blanc. I'm only writing this review because some of the reviews are completely ridiculous:

- ""We queued four hours"". Make a reservation online beforehand -- it's the most popular attraction in Chamonix by miles and miles. Did you really expect to just turn up and waltz on to a cable car in the middle of the holiday season?

- ""It's cold at the top"". Bring a jacket. Did you never wonder why Mont Blanc is, you know... white?

- ""We had to wait two hours to go back down."" There are two cabins on each section to transport every visitor up and down. They have a limited capacity and, for obvious reasons, they're not going to exceed that. So if the site is busy, yes, you're going to have to wait to go back down. Just enjoy it; it's beautiful and it's not the kind of environment you see every day.

- ""The weather forecasting service isn't accurate."" This is the high mountains, not Belgium.

- ""We drove to Chamonix and it was closed and they hadn't telepathically communicated to us that that was the case."" There's a website. Use it.

- ""I couldn't park my caravan in the car park and treat it like my house."" I'm pretty sure everyone else is delighted to hear that.

- The best comment of all ""This is France, not the real mountains you expect in Switzerland."" Yes, dear. Not only are you looking at the highest mountain in western Europe, but a good chunk of what you're looking at *is* Switzerland, the Swiss border being all of 13 kilometres away (and Italy even closer). Besides which, I'm not sure the mountains have a nationality. They're mountains.

Very few places like this exist in the world. It is busy. It is also extraordinary, both as an engineering achievement and as a high mountain environment to which you are delivered in half an hour without having to put on so much as a walking boot. I have no idea what some people were expecting but two words spring to mind: be realistic.","Written March 3, 2020"

You'll see people with their gear, going up to go down the other on their skis and using their ropes. The views from the top are incredible and indescribable.

I am quite scared of unstable heights but thought it would be ok, thankfully my teenage daughter was amazing, as on the second part gondola, it suddenly braked, swang for 5 minutes (felt like an hour!) and then moved on. This did shake myself and friend up a bit, once we got up, its then slowly chugs up the face of the mountain....the views and the set up are incredible and worth it.

It was so beautiful, the view of the Chamonix Valley was amazing, but that was the only saving grace to make this a 3 star review. We were really disappointed that we couldn't go all the way up.

The buses were free but crammed full of skiers with all their equipment, unable to move, wearing cold weather clothing most people were melting, not a pleasant experience when the journey was half an hour each way. The prettiest ski area we went to was le tour/la vormaine with free ski practise areas for beginners. overall lovely if you have lots of money to spend and hire a car.","Written January 14, 2020"

France,Aiguille du Midi,It's all about the ride,"In contrast to the Skyway which is just about getting you to the top of the mountain as fast as it can (with good views), the ride to the Aiguille from the Italian side is about giving you a suspended view for an extended period of time. It's breathtaking...and absolutely beautiful. We did the Skyway and then the ride to the Aiguille and skipped the ride down to the French side. It was plenty for us and I think the Italian side of the mountain is more scenic. Just MHO.","Written January 4, 2020"

France,Aiguille du Midi,Dizzying Heights -literally,"If you want to have a good view of Mont Blanc ( 4800 m) you need to go to the top point in Aiguille de Midi ( AdM) at height of 3800. Take the mountain lifts in two stages and then get on to a high speed lift to climb last lap to top. The trip costs 60Euro which is much cheaper than Jungfrau and MT.Titlis trips. In mountains,however,you need luck with weather. When we reached top it was snowing which we enjoyed. But we could not view Mont Blanc or any thing else. I had a strange experience. I used a washroom at the top and suddenly felt the floor swinging. Immediately I unlocked door and went out . I then realised I was experiencing altitude sickness. So be careful not use toilets at top.
We then retreated to slightly lower level by the lift. Indian couple from US ( Pleasanton) helped us with clicking a few photographs and then we rushed to the lifts to go down. After reaching the bottom we went to the cafeteria and got ourselves some Coffee to restore the body temperature. The place had a memorabilia shop where we picked a magnet pic of mountain ranges.","Written November 16, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,This was my vertigo challenge to myself,"I went with twenty friends. We all had a wonderful time. The views are exceptional and we left with lots of photos and memories. I was a little disappointed that our allotted few seconds in the glass cube was more a quick photo opportunity than a step over the void and a real look at what was below. It took me a few seconds before I could look down and then my time was up. An assistant takes your camera and takes a picture of you but the one that took ours appeared to know nothing about shooting into the light...so it could have been anyone in the picture. I would recommend that if you would like a different, additional picture and you are there with a group get a good photographer to take a picture of the side of the glass box with you in it from the viewing platform outside. Remember, it is going to be cold up there! Would go again.","Written November 8, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Chamonix - Aguile du Midi tour,"Hello everybody.

Depending on your day, you should know that you need to be early here because the last descending is at 16:30.

The time for ascending/descending takes about 30 minutes.

There is a bar at the top, but you can also eat some homemade sandwiches at the bottom (it is in the city center, situated at 200 meters from the ticket stand).
On top, the view is amazing ... 360 view.
There is another elevator that takes you at the top!
Also, there is a special glass box where you can take pictures and see the mountain under you! -- not for those with heart problems.
The pressure will be heavy for the first couple of minutes after you are up there.
Also, the pressure will be changed when you come back on the ground.

Perfect also for ski.

Take winter clothes for up there.

Fully charged mobiles and cameras also!
The cold up there will discharge them faster.

Enjoy!","Written November 2, 2019"

We received a queue jump ticket directly from our hotel (Helicoptic Spa & Hotel) which is where I would also recommend staying as the cable car is directly outside!

Our trip took 10 mins in a cable car where you change cable cars half way and another 10 min trip. It‚Äôs all really well run and very smooth journey.
Absolutely incredible views the whole way up and a must do.
My boyfriend went into ‚Äòstep into the void‚Äô which is a glass box that hangs off the side of the mountain. It‚Äôs a great attraction that is free however be prepared to queue for about an hour, worth it though if you‚Äôre into that sort of thing!

The cable car goes to the mid station and then you change tot he top station at 3842 m - there is a huge complex to investigate - views everywhere to Switzerland and to Mt. Blanc - it was -10 degrees Celsius!

France,Aiguille du Midi,Eye opening views!,"I am so glad my mother and I did this! We got there early, and there wasn't much of a line, got right to the ticket counter and made it to the cable car right after. Lady at ticket counter was a bit short and said the weather was bad, but we came all the way to go up and glad we still did. 2 cable cars up, we made. There were clouds in the beginning, but about 10 minutes after standing outside, the clouds cleared and we got amazing views of Mont Blanc and all other mountains in the area. Loved being able to walk through the tunnel and step outside to play in the snow. Highly recommend doing this! We did get dizzy a couple of times if we were going up the steps quickly or didn't stop to focus on breathing slower, but if you get short of breath, take a sit and some deep breaths. They were doing some kind of cleaning on the left side when you cross the bridge, and whatever chemicals they were using to clean took everyone's breath away and someone almost passed out from it, my mother included, we had to go back to the bridge to get fresh air before we could go back in towards the right. Not sure what they were doing, but if they are going to use strong chemicals like that, do it when people are not visiting.

France,Aiguille du Midi,The day before hiking the TMB,"The day before we started our Tour Du Mont Blanc hike, we rode the tram up the Aiguille du Midi. The weather was gorgeous and the views were awesome. Highly recommend doing it. It was worth every euro.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Fantastic Return Visit!,"We had a wonderful return vist to Aiguille du Midi.

As we were staying in Chamonix for 3nts, we opted for the 2-day Multi Pass which cost 80Euro per adult. That compares to 63Euro for one return trip up to Aiguille du Midi, so we feel the Multi Pass is excellent value - especially as it also covers the Br√©vent-Fl√©g√®re cable car, Montenvers Mer de Glace train, and the Tramway du Mont-Blanc - plus other transport as well. This visit, we had two return trips up to Aguille du Midi, a return trip on the Mer de Glace train, and the Brevent Cable Car, so the Multi Pass easily paid for itself.

On our first day, we arrived at the cable car station in Chamonix around 9am and there was about a 30min queue for the ticket office, and we were given a boarding number for the cable car, but we didn't have to wait long. The following day, we got there earlier and didn't have any waiting.

The actual cable car journey up to Aiguille du Midi is in two stages - and if you want you can leave the cable car at the first stage and visit the lovely cafe with amazing views down over the valley and glacier. Then you can go back to he cable car station and wait for he next cable car to take you up to Aiguile du Midi.

Once up to AdM, there is so much to do, lots of viewing decks, and the ""Step into the Void"" where you can step into a glass box and have your photo taken (using your own camera) of you standing above the valley and glacier - you just need to look for the signs to the lift that takes you up to the top level of the Station.

We also loved watching the mountaineers arriving and leaving AdM via the ice ridge out onto the mountain range - and all around AdM you can watch climbers tackling the rock faces - sometimes just a few feet away.

For additional charge, you can also take the Panoramic Cable Car across from AdM to Helbronner in Italy - which is an amazing trip - the view from the Cable Car and the Station is breathtaking, and there's a lovely cafe where we stopped for brunch before heading back to AdM.

Btw, just to mention that as it is really high up at AdM, it's a good idea to take fleece and jacket with you, as although it might be nice sunny and warm in Chamonix it can be quite chilly at the top. Also, the air is much thinner once you get to AdM - so walking up the stairs etc can feel like it takes a bit more effort, but we found it's not a problem if you take your time.",

You climb to 13000feet in 20 minutes and if you are prone to altitude issues you may be breathless, dizzy, faint.

The highlight for me was the section from Pont Helbonner to Midi (toward Courmayeur). It is a long section that transports you over a huge expanse of glacier... it was incredible!!! Definitely, a highlight from our trip! If you are coming from the Chamonix side, make sure to bring your passport as you will be entering Italy.

At first, I thought the cost was a bit excessive. However, the views and service were worth every Euro! In fact, I had hoped to ride up again from the Chamonix side, but sadly we didn‚Äôt have time for a second trip.","Written September 28, 2019"

France,Aiguille du Midi,Breathtaking...,"On my first visit to Chamonix, my mother took me to the T√©l√©ph√©rique de l‚ÄôAiguille du Midi.

Let‚Äôs put it that way :
- it is an expensive experience (120‚Ç¨ for two without the extra fancy activities : pas dans le vide or TC Panoramic Mont Blanc),
-you have to be patient (first week of september it was not possible anymore to pre-book a slot, so we queued for 1h30 to buy the tickets), on another hand we had very nice conversation with other visitors
-it is very busy, and therefore operations of the telecabine rotations are military style. For instance, as soon as you reach the summit, you are asked to choose a timeslot for your trip back down the valley.

BUT, it is so much worth it. The views are stunning, breathtaking, Let‚Äôs be honest, I will never climb the Mont Blanc but from the Aiguille du Midi you can grasp it in all its majesty. So yes, i recommend this experience , i would recommend you stay at least 1h30/2h00 up there.

Be prepared for some altitude sickness if you are susceptible, cramped cars, and lots of steps to the view areas. It will also be lots cooler / colder up there. The Midpoint has a place to purchase snacks and take short walks. It was expensive, $123 US dollars for 2 seniors but well worth it to enjoy the immense views and take photographs. We stood in line at the top to go in the glass floor area, but it was a long wait, so we dropped out. Highly recommend taking the gondola if sightseeing in Chamonix.",

That was great as could go straight to cable car queue and got first car at 08.10. When we got to the top we did have to wait 10 minutes or so for the elevator to the highest bit to open but looked round an exhibition in that time. Hardly a queue (4 in front)for the touching the void plastic box photo experience. Staff take your camera/phone to do the pictures which keeps any queue moving. However although you arent in the photo yourself we felt the better view of the box was from the terrace outside.
As others have said dress warmly and walk slowly until you are sure you are ok with the very high altitude. After an hour or so everything up there got busier but nowhere felt crowded.","Written September 19, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,"Quite expensive, but worth it!","The cable car trip up to Aiguille du Midi takes about 30 minutes. If you can, hop off in the middle of the way, where you have to change cars, and take a little walk around. Enjoy the views there before you go all the way up. Because when you get to the top you are ruined for every other view you will see here. You can walk around there and find so many different views. There is a restaurant, glass bottom viewing place, where you can take photos and also a little info about the high altitudes. We went there in august and we had only thin long sleeve blouses.

The prices for the up/back have gone way up to around 69 euros (?) per person. But you can see how they have reinvested in the exhibits and tunnels at the top. Be warned, it is cold up there so bring warm clothing and gloves/hat. Also, the winds can be quite harsh.You can at times see people skiing at the top and climbers ascending Mt. Blanc.

France,Aiguille du Midi,The Panorama ride from Aguille du Midi cable station over the glacier to Italy,"Possibly more spectacular than a visit to Jungfraujoch in the Bernese Oberland since you ride serenely above the glaciers in an enclosed cable car rather than look out a train window or walk around the station. From the perspective of the Panorama cable car the views of the peaks and massive ocean of glaciers is simply serene. Other trips near Chamonix, such as the Mer de Glace train trip, Brevent cable car, or Tramway de Mont Blanc to Nid d'Aigle, all show tragic evidence of melting ice, but from the cable car it is possible to see the mountain more like it would have been in the past.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Plan ahead to avoid longt waits,"This is a very expensive cable car ride, but it takes you first to a half-way station and then (via smaller cable car) to 12600ft.

Be aware that people book a slot on the first cable car days in advance, and without this, you have to queue up for a time-slot later in the day. This applies from 8am but you can (if you can‚Äôt sleep) catch it without a ticket (but still paying) from 6:30 to 8am.

We arrived around 9am and were given a slot of 10:30 so went to have a walk around town in the meantime.

At the top, there are 2 other things to do.

There is an elevator up to a lookout, which had a 20 minute wait time, and another cable car that takes you across a hanging valley of snow. This, however, is another (approx) ‚Ç¨30 per person, and has another 20 minute wait.","Written September 6, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,"Great even with clouds,rudest ever cafeteria staff!","We decided to go up today even though it looked a bit hit and miss with the weather. I went 10 years ago and there's so much more up there now.
We had sun snow and clouds but amazing experience.
To warm up we went into the cafeteria where it wasn't clear if you picked the food or were served. The woman just pointed and grunted at the cash desk so my husband put some soup in a pot and took it to the desk to pay.
She slammed it down and told us off like children!!!!!
I have never met someone in customer service so rude and actually upset me!
There was no one around to complain to so I hope they read this!!

France,Aiguille du Midi,Overwhelming views,"I was nervous about this part of my day trip to Chamonix having heard that this cable car can be quite a roller coaster but actually it was really thrilling! It feels a lot slower than it looks from the ground and when passing the other car going the other way. It shook a little going over the brackets bit otherwise very smooth. They do try to fit as many people in as they can so I made sure to be near the front of the queue to get on so I could see the view.
The mountain itself was stunning (see my other review). I did get a little out of breath going up the few steps to the different platforms thanks to the high altitude and had a headache but it was so worth it!",
France,Aiguille du Midi,So disappointed and far too expensive,"Most disappointing part of our holiday- but also the most expensive thing we did. ¬£224 for a return trip for 4 of us. Going up was fine- they explained the weather wasn‚Äôt too good; probably one reason we got on and up to summit so quickly. However as we got off at the top we were handed a numbered ticket and told our descent wasn‚Äôt for 2 hours and 30 minutes.
I don‚Äôt understand why if they can tell you the weather conditions they can‚Äôt also tell you the about huge delay to come back down again. it was zero degrees up there.

It was packed up there , the extremely overpriced restaurant packed out with cold fed up people. Everyone asking to come down sooner but being told no.
We‚Äôve been here before a few years ago and it was amazing. But now. Feels very revenue based- just intent on squeezing as many people in the cars with no thought about bringing everyone back. Also as with other reviews don‚Äôt go if you are claustrophobic as they pack you in like sardines.
How they can justify the price for being so under whelmed.

France,Aiguille du Midi,So Disappointed!,"We arrived in Chamonix today and we were anxious to experience cable car üö† to Mont Blanc. We walked from our hotel to the station and purchased tickets with no delays. We took both cars to the top and enjoyed the scenery. Once we arrived we were given tickets with a number that meant we would have to wait 2 hours before before we could return to the bottom. We decided to eat in the restaurant to pass the time. With 20 minutes to go we got in line and were herded into a car 15 minutes late but we were packed in so tight, we regretted the experience. Anyone who is anxious or claustrophobic or unable to stand in one place for 30 minutes should avoid this activity!!!! The cable car was overloaded!","Written August 27, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Amazing Views,"First I really have to admit that it was the BEST attraction in Chamonix, views from Aiguille are amazing! If you wish to visit only one telepherique in Chamonix - this is the one! Another important thing is to take warm clothes, we had winter jackets and were a little cold, but it was only May. There are awesome views from up there and I recommend to go early in the morning, when there is a high chance to actually see Mont Blanc as most of the time it's hidden in the clouds.","Written August 23, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Amazing views,"This is worth the money though it isn't cheap. The views from the top on a clear day are spectacular.

Tips:

Go early - less wait and likely to be clear. On a weekday in late August there was minimal waiting either at the bottom or top at 8am. Once we had done what we wanted at the top we could go straight down.

Get a pass - this also allows access to many other cable cars and attractions such as Montenvers and the Mont Blanc Tramway. The cost is only a little more than the Aiguille cable car alone, and if you get it in advance that's one less queue you need to be in!

Reserve your ascent in advance - likewise with Tramway de Mont Blanc. You do this on the website for free (you still need to buy a ticket or pass at some point). If you do this and get your pass in advance you basically join the boarding queue at the alloted time, bypassing the much longer queue for people who do not have reservations or tickets.

It's cold at the top, so bring a coat",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Amazing and worth every cent to travel up Mt Blanc ...,A trip up to Mt Blanc is worth every cent of the c. EUR 195 we paid for 2 adults + 2 young kids ... but its worth it. 2 amazing cable car rides take you almost to the top (but obviously not to the actual summit). Amazing views ... pick your day of you can ... we had clear blue sky but the weather can cha ge quickly up mountains so be warned. It was 30 deg at the base by 0 deg up top ... so remember warm clothes ... it is cold and windy up there ... and we went in near perfect conditions. Avoid the snacks up there ... take your own food and drink. Youd need a mortgage for 4 hot choc drinks + 4 bags of crisps ... but lesson learnt. Kids absolutely loved it... sure its expensive but you are going up Mt Blanc ... enjoy its worth every penny and minute of queuing.,"Written August 18, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Nice views only in good weather,"Not cheap at 63-64 euros and better that you check the weather and reserve ahead. People who comes here likes to check this cable car item off so reservations helps. 2 stage ride and timing bit hard to understand to and fro, guess they need to manage both ways‚Äô traffic.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Stunning Views and an amazing experience,"Not sure what to expect, I was blown away by the experience. We were lucky to have a lovely, clear, sunny day and therefore the views from the top were quite stunning. You feel you can almost reach out and touch Mont Blanc. But there is also so much else to do, explore the history of the mountain, mountaineering and the gondola, lots of terraces providing different panoramas, the 'step into the void', and various restaurants providing very reasonably priced food, all things considered. My one warning is about quenes and therefore definitely pre-plan your trip. Some slots can be reserved in advance on their website and this is definitely worth doing. Otherwise, you may have to wait a good few hours to get a ride. We arrived at 1030 and the first ascent we could get was at 1400; admittedly this was peak season in August. Whilst it is expensive, combined with a 2-day or multiple-day forfait, the price is quite reasonable. We combined this visit with the tramway du Mont Blanc across in Le Fayet/St Gervais, which I would equally recommend.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Utterly terrible. Beware of being held hostage at top for 2 and a half hour wait to descend.,No one tells you you have to book a particular car up. We arrived at 10 and got tickets for 3:30 intending to go to Italy which closes at 4. On reaching top at 3:50 we were told Hellebruner shut at 3:00 with no signs at bottom. On trying to descend back to Chamonix we were given tickets for descent at 6:00. Avoid unless you like being held hostage...,"Written August 14, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Great experience. Top of Europe.,Aiguille du Midi is a must if you are in Chamonix on a sunny day. Best is to be in the cabin station around 8am. You can buy cabin tickets there. You can also buy the Mont-Blanc multipass by 3 more euros. You'd have access to most of cabins and trains there. For instance the train to Mer the Glace. Try to go there in early afternoon. Great experience overall.,"Written August 12, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Aiguille du Midi is a must do!,"Outstanding views, great experience not to be missed on your trip. I had a multi pass which allowed unlimited travel on the cable car and train and offered a saving if you intend to do lots of walking. The queues at Chamonix are long so I got up early on the Sunday morning and got into the second cable car at 6.30am. I was a bit nervous on the way up but as soon as I stepped out I was amazed at the size and natural beauty of the place.","Written August 9, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,A must see,"If you are in Chamonix on a clear day you must take the cable car to the top of the Aiguille du Midi. You will be transported to a world that is completely different from the Chamonix Valley. You will have views of three countries and an up close experience with Mont Blanc. The trip is expensive so I recommend that you include it as part of a Multi Pass. Also, in the Summer you can reserve a time online. That will help because the lines are really long on pretty days. Also, go early. The air at ‚Äúthe top‚Äù will be cooler and the crowds will be fewer.","Written August 8, 2019"

Pre-book your tickets (hope for good weather) and get the earliest time because it can be crazy busy up there.

If you want to scare the crap out of yourself there is a glass box which hangs out over the edge. The line up for this experience was 45 min long so we skipped it.

France,Aiguille du Midi,"Breathtaking, just amazing and a must-see","I can‚Äôt really say much about it. I would only say the views are amazing, the queueing and logistics were seamless, and the things to do when at the top were endless.

However, note that it will be very cold even in the summer, you will need to dress with trousers and fleeces, and kids may not find the height or the movement of the cable car in the wind a breeze, it can provoke some fears, even from grown ups. If not, highly recommend the ‚ÄòStep into the Void‚Äô which offers a view from a glass box.

Also, get there as early as possible ie before 9 to get the best experience and ignore ‚Äòchangeable weather‚Äô because cloudy days can still offer a full view, but if you can get a clear day it would be better. And finally, this experience is best enjoyed with a multiple non consecutive day multi pass which offers access to many other attractions.","Written August 6, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Get the multipass!,"Its expensive but worth it. But check if your hotel sells the Chamonix multipass. Ours sold it at a discounted price making it cheaper to buy than the normal round trip ticket up the cable car. And it meant we could use it around town on the other included locations.

I'm not convinced that the Into the Void thing is worth the wait - we did it but the photos are underwhelming. And check the weather first - you want a clear blue sky!

If you are going to buy tickets on the day, allow two hours from arriving and actually getting on the cable car. So, if you want to go climbing for the day, get there really early.

Recommended.","Written August 5, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Get the Mount Pass before and arrive early to enjoy this amazing view!,"We thoroughly enjoyed the time at the top of Aiguille du Midi...there you could see rock climbers, tremendous view of Mont Blanc and other surrounding mountains......we went in the void and that was an experience of looking straight down a long way. A great day!",
France,Aiguille du Midi,"Incredible view, but at a price","My wife suggested to visit the Aiguille du Midi with our kids. The ridiculously high entrance fee (‚Ç¨ 242 for the four of us) initially held me back, but my wife - and the positive reviews on Tripadvisor - convinced me after all. And I‚Äôm happy about that.

So today we went and we went EARLY. We managed to get there at 6:20 AM and I can‚Äôt recommend getting there early enough. Within 30 minutes we were on our way to the top. That‚Äôs something else than buying your ticket at 8AM and get back at 12AM-ish for your ride - if you manage to still find a parking spot at that time.

(When we got back down around noon lines where very long and the parking lot was full.)

So, we got there early and we were at 3,842 meters altitude at 7:10AM.

From that moment, all we could say was WOW. Wow, what a view! We‚Äôve visited several gletschers, but this was something completely different. Up there, it‚Äôs rocky. Very rocky. Not much snow (except for the Mont Blanc, of which you have a magnificent view), but many very steep rocky peaks. Out of this world, you must see it to believe it.

The visitor centre on the summit easily keeps you entertained for an hour or two. I know it kept US entertained for almost four hours and personally I could have stayed there all day. There are several terraces from which you‚Äôre not only amazed by the different parts of the mountains you‚Äôre looking at, but by the different views of the construction as well: building this was, in my opinion, a fantastic accomplishment.

So, besides the very steep entrance fee, is there anything I did not like? Well, yes, and it also has to do with money. There‚Äôs a restaurant up there. And some person thought it was wise to ask people completely ridiculous prices for their products. ‚Ç¨ 7,50 for some orange juice?! ‚Ç¨ 21 for four cups of machine produced hot chocolate - without (!) whipped cream, mind you. Come on. I know we‚Äôre not obliged to buy anything from them, but this is just a complete and utter lack of respect to the customer. Shame on the person responsible for those restaurant prices.

Gladly, the surrounding result of Mother Natures effort makes it all worth it. Go there and be amazed.","Written August 4, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Waiting times not too bad if you get there early,"We went on a Sunday in the height of summer when the forecast was bright sunshine so we knew it would probably be busy. The website said it opened at 6.30am. We arrived at 7.30am having parked at the Grepon car park which is just a short walk away. We had tried to buy a family multipass online the previous day but it hadn‚Äôt worked possibly because we didn‚Äôt have enough internet reception. I think if we‚Äôd managed to do that we may have had less queuing to do as there are automatic machines at the Information stand where you can pick up your multi passes (or boarding cards just for that day?) if you had bought online. It wasnt quite clear. But as it was we had to get into the main queue to buy our multi passes.

The queue was already extending out of the roped queuing area when we arrived, but only by about 10 people. There weren‚Äôt many ticket booths open at first but then they had all 5 open which made the queue go more quickly. We were in the queue for 45 minutes. There is a little coffee/snack kiosk next to the queue so I went out to get coffees and croissants with our boys (5 and 7) whilst my husband stayed in the queue. People were also popping out of the queue to go the toilets which were nearby too.

We bought a family multipass for 6 non-consecutive days which you have to use within a 15 day period. We‚Äôd taken photo id along just in case but didn‚Äôt need it. They just ask you to write down all your names and an email address then they take photos of all of you individually through the screen and give you individual cards. I‚Äôd read on trip advisor that you needed to reserve when you were going up in the cable car but we were just told we could go straight into the queue without having made a timed reservation. Maybe it was because we were there so early? I feel that if we‚Äôd managed to buy our multi passes before the morning we wanted to go up in the cable car, we could probably just go straight into the cable car queue but I‚Äôm not 100% sure.

It was quite cold at this time of the morning so the children were wearing all their warm clothes even down in the queue in Chamonix at ground level. They had thick socks and walking trainers on, walking trousers, a long sleeved base layer, a short sleeved t shirt and a fleecy thin jumper plus their wind proof water proof coats and just their summer caps and sunglasses. We didn‚Äôt bring gloves and woolly hats etc but the boys did complain about being cold at the top so maybe we should. We also brought sweets and water with us to give them energy up at the top where the air is thinner as we‚Äôd read some people feel dizzy up there.

The queue for the cable car only took about 10 minutes. You have to take your rucksack off your shoulders when getting in so more people can get in. You all get squashed in then go up to the next level where you get off. When you go past other cable cars going the other way it‚Äôs a bit wobbly. Then you need to get onto the next cable car. There was no queue at this time. You did have to show your multipass again to get on the cable cars each time. There are toilets and a cafe at this level if you want them.

When you‚Äôve been on the next cable car there are spectacular views obviously and lots of great photo opportunities. You feel like you‚Äôre right on top of the world. We arrived at this level about 1 hour after we‚Äôd initially arrived and had to queue etc.

There are toilets and a gift shop but they‚Äôre up quite a lot of stairs. It‚Äôs the same stairs you have to go up to get back to Chamonix so if you‚Äôre not desperate for the toilet you might want to just go there on the way past when you‚Äôre about to return to Chamonix.

We then queued for the elevator - it said there was a 5 minute wait but actually it was more like 30 minutes as they‚Äôd reached the maximum number of people on the upper level. By the time we came back down the wait time was 55 minutes according to the electronic sign. You do get amazing views from the top and it wasn‚Äôt busy at all up there so you‚Äôre not all jammed in.

We didn‚Äôt do Step into the Void as the boys were tired and cold but it looked like the queue was 30 minutes. There were no queues on our way back down to Chamonix - the lift queue was non existent and we got straight into each cable car going down without any trouble. We stopped off at the mid-level to get an ice cream at the cafe. It was quite warm by then and so we had to take some of our layers off. We were back down in Chamonix by 11pm, having arrived there at 7.30am. There were still some car park spaces when we went back to the car but not many. A lot of spaces are taken up by campervans which take up more than one space. You can pay for your parking by card at the machine - we stayed for lunch and by the time we left parking cost us 6 euros. It was really hot back down in Chamonix so we were glad we‚Äôd brought some summer clothes with us to change into.","Written August 4, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Amazing place - unforgettable,"Try to catch the first cable car up in the morning. That way you can pretty much stay up there for hours and come back when you want, before the crowds build up. You will not need to queue for Step Into The Void if you go straight there. Also, if you find the air too thin then you can come straight back down again on the next cable car. Later in the day, when the crowds build up, you have to book a return time.

There is a restaurant at the top where you can get breakfast. Amazing views and a surprising variety of places to see in the complex. We spent 2 1/2 hours up there and could have stayed longer.

Stop at the middle Station on the way down for great views back up to the summit.","Written August 1, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,You have to do it!,"Yes it is busy. How anyone can expect anything less is beyond me. I‚Äôve queued longer at theme parks for experiences not a fraction as great as this. Accept that there will be queues. It is completely and utterly worth it. Make sure you choose a clear day and get there early.

We planned our visit using Trip Advisor reviews so here‚Äôs my contribution:

We arrived just after 8am and used the Grepon car park - very close and we found there were plenty of spaces. The queuing system can be confusing initially - we hadn‚Äôt bought a multi pass in advance so joined the ‚Äòred dot‚Äô queue. The queue was up to the end of the roped barrier at the time and took approx 40 mins (the queue got much longer during this time however) Here we bought our multi pass and got our ‚Äòchit‚Äô for the lift. We were allocated a lift for around two hours later which gave us enough time to explore the town and get a coffee and gaufres!

We got a two day (non consecutive days) family multipass which cost ¬£266 (we also visited the Tram on the same day and Montenvers/Mer de Glace and Planiards another day so this was good value for money)

The lifts themselves we well organised as long as you tolerate a little waiting and quite cramped especially on the way down. When the gondolas pass the masts they swing a bit which causes some laughter and wobbling passengers unless you‚Äôre fearful of the lift bit in which case they cause mild panic. Just be aware it‚Äôs going to happen!

At the top of the Aiguille we went straight to the lift up to the very top. There was little queue at this point (it had built up when we came back down) The Step into the Void queue was 1/2 hour long and we did it but if I‚Äôm honest it wasn‚Äôt really worth it - they take photos for you on your mobile which is cool but it doesn‚Äôt last long enough for you to enjoy the view from the glass box. The view from all around this higher area however is spectacular and worth all the waiting and cost.

We only got 1.5 hours at the top so we were squeezed for time. You get given your return time when you get there. Had we prioritised a snack or the gift shop we would have missed out. We didn‚Äôt even get over to the side with the restaurant and shop in the time we had.

We could notice the thinner air and all of us at some point felt mildly dizzy. It‚Äôs worth being aware of this. We brought some sugary sweets and plenty of water for the kids (8 and 5 yo) but this was just as useful for us bigger kids :)

We got back down in Chamonix 3.5 hours after leaving and raced to the tram to squeeze our moneys worth out of the multipass. I won‚Äôt leave a separate tram review - it was OK - it didn‚Äôt come close to matching the Aiguille du Midi.","Written July 31, 2019"

France,Aiguille du Midi,"Amazing, bus sadly mega overcrowded, experience","To tell about the beauty of this place is useless; countless reviews have done this way better than I could ever do. Amazing scenery, very polite and nice crew all over, all very professional and well-organized.
However, and this is a HUGE however, the experience inside the cable cars is AWFUL. Because of the enormous amount of people wanting to visit this place, they cram an awful lot of people inside each cable car, and trust me, sardines have it better inside a can. The prices are pretty elevated, so I think they could easily limit even more the number of people visiting the place daily, by lowering by 10-15% the number of persons in a single trip.
Is this gonna happen? No. People will keep coming? Surely. But well, one must try by not giving 5* reviews....","Written July 30, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Amazing views of Mont-Blanc,"We took the cable car from Chamonix (1035 metres height) and we were up at the 3800 metres height viewing terrace of Aiguille du Midi in 20 minutes. The cable car journey was in 2 phases. The transfer from one cable car to the next was very efficient and without losing any time.

The views were spectacular during the trip one could see chamonix valley and town looking minuscule as the cable car soared up the mountains.

Some people could be heard shrieking as the cable car lurched on its upward journey.

On reaching the top, we found many viewing terraces, each having a panaromic view of the mountains and Chamonix town and valley. There are quite a few restaurants and cafes on top.

The 360 degrees view from the top was fantastic, with Mont Blanc main summit rising another 1000 metres from the viewing platforms. There was snow all around and two glaciers could be seen.

There is a viewing deck made of glass all around even the floor is glass and you feel as if you are hanging in the void more than 1000 metres above.

Some people could be seen suffering from hypoxia at that high altitude due to rapid ascent of about 2800 metres; so caution is advised for people suffering from breathing disorders.

One can easily spend at least 2 hours admiring the high altitude views.

The return was equally smooth as the staff gave numbered tokens for each batch of return trip, with departure time.

Our cable car left on time all nicely packed in (it is peak season) the accent took 10 mins we then got into the second car taking 10 mins both were fine.

Maybe even stop for something to light to eat. Drink plenty of water and don't ignore the lightheadedness. Advise getting to the ticket office at Chamonix early (we tried to buy tx on line, but it wouldn't work). Yes you will wait in line, but it's all worth it. The experience is breathtaking (almost literally!)","Written July 22, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Take the entire cable car route,"We rode the cable car and gondola system the entire way from Chamonix to Courmayeur on the 3 segments which are operated by 3 different companies:

1. The Aiguille du Midi cable car takes you from Courmayeur to Aiguille du Midi;
2. Panaromic Mont Blanc connects the top of the French and Italian peaks;
and
3. Skyway Monte Bianco is the Italian segment from Pointe Helbronner to Courmayeur.

It is about 110 Euros to do the entire thing but the views at the top are priceless, I would pay $1000 for what we saw. The moment we got down the mountain I was thinking I would not hesitate to do it again.

We bought tickets for each segment as we went along, since each segment is run by a different company. I was told there is some combo option where you can ride everything then take a bus back through the Mont Blanc tunnel to your starting point (we didn‚Äôt figure that out; we had overnight backpacks with us as we were not returning to Chamonix). We spent 5 hours up there including stops to walk around at some of the stops. If you don‚Äôt stop you can probably do it in 3 hours.

The views from Panoramic Mont Blanc are the best as you see the highest part of the mountains, covered in vast glacial ice, that otherwise only mountaineers can see. The views from Skyway Monte Bianco were better than the French side (Aiguille du Midi cable car from Chamonix to Aiguille di Midi) because you see a vaster range of the Italian peaks; on the French side you see more of Chamonix valley.

Prepare your cold weather clothing and take it easy - you will feel the elevation.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Fantastic View - Beware of Altitude Sickness,We got tickets for seniors and we‚Äôre shoved into the cable car to the top. The views along the way were great except we weren‚Äôt near the windows due to crowding. At the top there is a wonderful film of the mountains with great music. I hadn‚Äôt acclimated for enough days. Sitting in the cafe by the window I started to get a headache and reached in my purse for aspirin when I found myself on the floor. Didn‚Äôt remember how I got there. A Spaniard came over and told me to breathe deeply and focus on one thing. It helped. I did feel better when we returned to the bottom. Fabulous views!,
France,Aiguille du Midi,Amazing experience.,"Buy the multi-day holiday pass for best value. Big queues for the cable car if you go later in the day. At the top station it s a maze of passageways and stairs. Go across the bridge for the best experience. Better viewing platforms and information and a lift up to the top where you can queue for maybe 1 hour plus, to stand on a cantilevered glass floored box. Pay extra for a gondola ride over into Italy.","Written July 17, 2019"

France,Aiguille du Midi,Spectacular visit,"Originally we were put off from doing this day trip from Annecy by numerous comments online about needing to arrive very early because of huge queues, after which you still had to wait for your cable car time slot. The Oui bus from Annecy was a good service, though times varied depending on weekday. Due to an accident en Route our bus was diverted and we didn‚Äôt arrive at Chamonix until 10.30am. Arriving so late we assumed queues would be huge but to our surprise when arriving at the ticket office there were only a few people in front of us. Access to cable cars took only a few minutes also. We didn‚Äôt wait to go up in the final lift to ‚Äú Step into the Void‚Äù as this had a 25 min wait time one way and we were on limited time with a bus booked back to Annecy in mid afternoon. We had a spectacular day, as others have said just do it. It‚Äôs an amazing experience and to make our day even better it was a beautiful day with clear skies. We could just have been lucky not having to queue as I‚Äôm sure there must be lots of times you do. However don‚Äôt be put off and give it a go, we are so glad we did.","Written July 16, 2019"

France,Aiguille du Midi,AMAZING!!!,"Taking the cable car up Aiguille du Midi was the highlight of our honeymoon. The view was spectacular! You don't realize how big Mont Blanc is until you're eye-to-eye. Lots of things to see at the top. Make sure you Step Into the Void - I'm not afraid of heights, but this made me hesitate. Worth every penny!","Written July 15, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,"In summer, crowded but efficiently run, view is unforgettable","L‚ÄôAiguille du Midi is one sight of several in the charming but quite commercial ski resort town of Chamonix, France. It is only an hour or so drive from Geneva and gets a lot of traffic from the city and even directly from the airport. Tours are very expensive and booking them is confusing. Still, the scene at Chamonix was hectic, but well organized so the more you get settled before you get there, the better your experience is likely to be. An efficient and well trained international and multilingual staff moves along the lines at the base according to ticket/no ticket/tour ticket and moves to a line for the first of two cable cars to L‚ÄôAiguille.

At the end of the cable car ride you can amble around a series of platforms separated by lots of steps, visit either the restaurant or a small cafeteria for a meal or a snack. The views are great but save memory space for the platform at L‚ÄôAiguille.

You cross over from that structure to another which has more viewing platforms from a different perspective and an elevator up to the top of L‚ÄôAiguille. The wait for the elevator can be 30+ minutes. I thought L‚ÄôAiguille was the highlight, it‚Äôs austere dark jagged rocks against glaciers and perpetual snow reaching as far as the eye can see is an unforgettable sight. Time taken away from this to wait in a long queue for the Step Into The Void was in my opinion a waste.

L‚ÄôAiguille is at 12,000 feet, can be quite cold (30 degrees when we were there in July) so be prepared for some cold and altitude sickness if you are not used to that. It‚Äôs hard to tolerate it for too long. Also, clouds can roll in quickly and can change the view, so keep an eye on weather forecasts for L‚ÄôAiguille in particular. Our step into the void was a step into clouds.","Written July 15, 2019"

Getting in lines, waiting in lines(get there earlier than 2pm during current bz season) all worth it
Kids and wife had a wow moment.

The difficulty with some breathing is manageable. There is a restaurant up there where one can go if they are not feeling well due to 13000 feet height

France,Aiguille du Midi,Scared of Heights? Me Too!,"I hate Cable Cars. I hate Heights. So what on earth was I thinking about visiting this place? Well, turns out it was absolutely brilliant. I looked at my feet for the 20 minute cable car journey that seemed to be going more vertical than horizontal at points but once you are at the top, the views are out of this world. Mont Blanc is just beautiful to look at but the mountains to the North are more spectacular. Get up there early as it gets very busy and don't spend too long as you do notice the thinner air. Just do it!","Written July 14, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Spectacular view to majestic Mount Blanc,"You take the lift to Plan de l‚Äôaiguille(2300 m) from the valley station which is large and sometimes crowded. Help is offered from ‚Äúofficials‚Äù in-and outside, friendly and helpful, english speaking if you wish so. From Plan you take the cable car to ‚ÄúMidi‚Äù (3800 m) which is breathtaking. The are excibitions, mounteniering instructions and films, shop, cafe, and the ‚Äústep into the void‚Äù glascage hanging from the side of the mountain.

Tip1. With MontBlanc multipass go directly to staff at boarding queue - saved a lot of time! Tip2. Park in Grepon car park. Tip3. Have a shot of step into the void - staff will take photos with your camera -say cheese! Tip 4. Have plenty of charge and storage on your phone.",

France,Aiguille du Midi,Speechless - best view we‚Äôve ever seen,"We bought the chamonix summer pass which gave us access to all the lifts for 4 days. We then booked the Mont Blanc cable car 2 days in advance so we didn‚Äôt need to queue.

We went up at 8.20
In the morning (in a Thursday) and luckily no queues. Reached the top and our legs felt like jelly and assumed it was from the cable car - however, it was the altitude. Had to keep stopping to breath deeply but it was fine.
We were very lucky as weather beautiful and the views were simply stunning.
Would definitely recommend doing this if it is a clear day",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Wow!,"This was awesome. Definitely worth the money. We travel as a family of 5, they offer a family pass for all the lifts. If you plan to use lifts and the train you should get this pass. It‚Äôs a family of 4, then we bought an additional single pass. I would recommend purchasing passes from the kiosk at the tourist office. Otherwise you will stand in a long line at the Aiguille du Midi lift. Views were breathtaking!","Written July 7, 2019"

Friend did suffer a bit with altitude sickness but it didn't spoil her time there.
Plenty of snow, rock climbers & hikers all enjoying what these magnificent mountains have to offer.",

France,Aiguille du Midi,Pretty but crowded,"The views are astonishing and you feel the high altitude effect pretty well.

However, the atraction feels like it is on the edge of being overcrowded. Especially going back down makes groups of tourists who still have to wait their turn block the ones whose turn it is. I would have liked more flexibility in going earlier than the time they assigned me.
Also, the food is ridiculously expensive: over 9 euros for a simple sandwich. I'd advise bringing your own.","Written July 1, 2019"

France,Aiguille du Midi,It was cool!,"Literally, the coolest adventure of our summer. We have a serious heatwave in Europe this summer and visiting l‚ÄôAiguille du midi was an effort to see something amazing and cool off at the same time. Well worth the scenic drive from Torino, the climb to the needle come in two separate parts so you can look around outside the mud-station, hike or have a bite to eat or a drink before you head on up. Amazing views and cool air await, bring a layer. If you like to hike or climb you can, but many just bring a picnic and enjoy the views.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Stunning views,"We spent more than 90 minutes at the top, there was so much to see both outside at all the different viewpoints and inside in the various displays. We did get up early so we could catch the first chair to the top and it was lovely not to be super crowded up there. Strongly recommend getting a 3 day pass if the weather is good and you enjoy views and walking, there is so much to see, and many different gondolas/ lifts to ride.","Written June 28, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Massive queues spoilt trip,"Whilst agree with all previous reviewers regarding the spectacular scenery the management of transfer of paying customers up and down the Auguille left a lot to be desired.

It was extremely hot and firstly had to queue in blazing sun for at least 45 minutes just to pay for tickets - there was definitely no allocation of gondola time slot!

We then had another 40 minute queue just to get on the 1st gondola.
This was duplicated at all stages.

Once at top scenery was spectacular.

Trying to come down the queues started again and by the time that we got down to the lower level we were told that there was a 55 minute wait queue before we could get the gondola down to the car park.
The one cafe/shop was running out of drinks and ice-creams that were needed to alleviate dehydration.
When we finally joined the queue to go down, the lift staff were distributing mugs of water - but this was the only thing that acknowledged the fact that the organisation was abysmal.

This was could potentially have been a dangerous situation as had to queue in blazing heat with no shelter - the temperature even at that altitude was about 27 degrees!

Good job that the weather was good as dread to think what would have happened if the weather had closed in.

Finally got back to car at about 7pm - last gondola down was supposed to be 5.30pm!
Spent on total at least 4 hours queuing.
Had wanted to see Mont Blanc for over 50 years after reading about the exploits of Bonatti, Messner, Brown, Whillans, etc.
Was definitely not disappointed by the scenery and visual displays relating the development of Mont Blanc and the Auguille.
DEFINITELY disappointed with the organisation of customer travel.
Recommend going but make sure that you are there as early as possible to ensure a relatively stress-less trip.
5 stars Scenery, 1 star on organisation","Written June 26, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Just go!,"Absolutely beautiful. We went during a bit of a heat spell in Chamonix so the chill was very welcome. We got to the lift around 8:15 or so and the wait was not too bad. The tourism office said if you wait to go at 10-11 the lines are much worse.

The views are stunning. Pictures don't do it justice. Food at the top made for a good lunch. But the combo ticket and do the train ride to the ice caves in the same day... Saves quite a bit of money.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Stunningly beautiful!,"This lift gets you up above 12,000 feet. If you‚Äôre someone from low altitude like I am, take it slow once you get up there, but the views are so worth it. Tons of vantages of the mountains all around you. Definitely learn about altitude sickness before visiting - you have to drink a lot of water and not rush your way around. We went on a busy day, so the lines were long, but it was fine. You buy your ticket, they give you a time and number of your ride, you go and shop in the gift shop for a bit, and then up you go. The cable car is packed with tons of people, so don‚Äôt expect to be able to sit down and get comfortable, but it‚Äôs a quick ride up (maybe a minute or two). It stops at Plan (half-way up) where you should keep going up to the top on the next cable car. Then they give you another time at the top when you‚Äôll return back down. Don‚Äôt worry - they‚Äôve been doing this awhile, so they give you plenty of time. We had brought a good camera and a snack, so we took tons of pictures at the different platforms and then sat down to eat our snack and enjoy the view. You can see the people coming and going to hike around up there on the snow. Fascinating! Then come back down, stop at Plan and decide whether you‚Äôre eating lunch at the cute little cafe there with red umbrellas or if you‚Äôre hiking down. It takes more like 3.5 hours to hike to Montenvers instead of the 2.5 hours they said (unless you‚Äôre an experienced mountain hiker) - I met another couple later who said they are from Denver, and they said it was beautiful and a great hike, but longer than expected. The altitude was still a bit much for us, so we decided not to hike. It was still completely worth it to take the Aiguille du Midi.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Breathtaking,"It was really worth to go up all the way!
It‚Äôs not cheap but it‚Äôs really worth it!
The view is stunning and breathtaking! You can even follow the mountain climbers down at the mountain! It was an experience I will never forget, I was here 40 years ago when I was 12 and it was very special to see it all again! Lots of things where totally different! Much more tourism that‚Äôs for sure!",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Don‚Äôt miss it!,,
France,Aiguille du Midi,Interesting shape of the mountains,"We visited this mountain after visiting a few in Switzerland, and found that the shape of this mountain to be quite different from those in Switzerland (eg Jungfrau). Overall speaking quite a wonderful experience. Amazing to see how thick the snow still are and how people hike on the snow and climb up the mountains.

Even we were visiting in mid-June which should still be the earlier part of summer, there were quite a bit of crowd so please allow more time for queuing.

One thing is that the cable car / gondola runs at quite a high speed (unlike those in Switzerland), which can be scary at times (but we do feel safe). The cable car / gondola which connects to the peak also elevate steeply (a bit too much? but amazing to see how is that even possible...)

Also worth noting is that the one-day pass which allows you to visit also the ice caves are quite a bargain (67 euro). But you will need go check the time if you want to go to both as the trains to ice caves end earlier than the mountain trains.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,A must see,"I always preferred sea and warm weather, but visited Aiguille du Midi. A bit scary to reach the top by cable car but the view is gorgeous. Unfortunately I was not enough brave to try ‚Äústep into the void‚Äù but maybe next time..",
France,Aiguille du Midi,"Pricey, but worth it","If you're not sure whether or not to sing the 60-odd euros on the cable car, go for it. The views at the intermediate station, as well as at the summit, are absolutely stunning. It's absolutely worth the money. The staff are also really friendly which is a plus!

We went on a very hot day in Chamonix. Make sure you bring something vaguely warm! I went up in t-shirt and shorts. Regretted it. Also make sure you bring sunglasses too.

Fantastic facilities at the top and the restaurant and gift shop are great, albeit pricey. Toilets at the top are good; they work in an... intersting way.",

It was very cold at the top (unsurprisingly) so take warm clothes plus sunglasses. The views are incredible plus we got to marvel at some groups climbing up the hard way (mad!). The only down side was the queuing system back down from the top. It took quite a long time and therefore took a (small) bit of a shine of the day. A shame as I think they‚Äôve worked quite hard to make the process going up pretty easy (when you take into account the number of people going up).

France,Aiguille du Midi,"Amazing Views, not for the faint of heart.","Don‚Äôt let a cloudy day deter you from taking the trip on this cable car. While it was overcast on the ground we choose to take the cable car up to the top of Mount Blanc. About halfway up the skies turned bright blue and it was sunny and stunning and the most gorgeous views I‚Äôve ever seen. Once you get to the top you can walk around and breathe in the fresh air and feel the warmth from the sun. Even though it was 25¬∞F if felt much warmer as you were that high up; it‚Äôs roughly 12,000 feet up. Be forewarned it is not for the faint of heart. I did notice some people struggling to breathe even though I had no issues whatsoever it can be difficult and be hard to breathe because the air is so thin. But that view is worth it. A little pricey and the cable car is packed, but what a great experience.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Amazing,"This was the highlight of our trip to Chamonix - it is an absolute must! It caters for absolutely anyone and everyone of all ages and abilities.

Once we were on line, we tried to go online to get tickets, as did the people in front of us! They were successful, but for us, after several attempts to create a user profile, the dates were grey‚Äôd out so we stayed on line! The most frustrating part of it is that the people that did get tix online, just got in front in order to get their number for the cable car üö†
There are no signs or anything telling people what the protocol is...there were a lot of very angry & frustrated people on line...luckily, you leave all that at the bottom as you climb up to the most beautiful scenery ever!

You may feel short of breath and your legs weak. Take it easy and breathe deeply, and you‚Äôll be fine.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Breath Taking,"Getting up to Aiguille-du-Midi is THE spot to see Mt.Mont-Blanc! We came early to avoid huge crowds from the insight info of thousands travelers arrived!
It was a great sunny day! Snow is white, sky is blue, mountains seems so near, some skiers, snow boarders came as early bird as well! They left nicely trails on the snow behind them! It became another shooting point for me!
Have to say the view is magnificent!

France,Aiguille du Midi,Stunning but ruined by tourists,"We went up twice. Once with pretty bad weather (lots of clouds) and once with sunshine and blue skies. The experience was a lot nicer with the bad weather. In good weather, rising the cable car up was extremely uncomfortable, crammed in like sardines and babbling Japanese tourists ruining the serenity of the views. Up on the Aguille du Midi it was very crowded. Long waiting lines for Pas dans Le Vide. But undeniably a must-see. Check the webcams before you go up!",

Cost me $ 63 return tickets, is worth for money!! The staff was friendly and helpful.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Awe-inspiring,"Going up the cable car and spending the morning on top of the Aiguille du Midi was an incredibly awe-inspiring experience. I was able to stand in right by the front window of the cable car and watch as we went up the mountain. It was freezing on the top so dress warmly. We also did Step into the Void, which was very cool. We went in May and there were no lines. Highly recommended!!","Written May 16, 2019"

France,Aiguille du Midi,Stunning. Must see.,"Cable-car ride up a steep mountainside might not be too everyone's taste but it was extremely smooth. Expect to be crammed in, though, to maximise numbers and minimise waiting time.
But, even for the nervous it's worth it. Staggeringly beautiful views at the top, and a chance to stand in a glass box above a sheer drop for the brave!
Be aware: there are lots of steps, and the high altitude could well make you breathless and wobbly.
Also, surprisingly easy to get sunburn on a clear day...

France,Aiguille du Midi,"So worthwhile on a fine day,special experience","What a fantastic experience, we felt like we were on top of the world !
We were very lucky to go on a sunny clear day, don‚Äôt think I would bother if overcast ,as you wouldn‚Äôt be able to see through the clouds.
Arrived at 9.30 am which was perfect timing on the day, the crowds of skiers had gone up earlier, so no queues when we went. Up the top it was -11 , but rugged up it felt fine,gloves where handy as well.
Amazing scenery, looking across to Mont Blanc & other mountains, this is the highest cable car in Europe at 3842 mt.
We also went into Step into the Void .....was pleasantly surprised that staff offered to take your photos for you both on your phone & camera...great service.
Allow 2.5 to 3 hours to wander the various lookouts & terraces.
Senior discounts are offered.
Wonderful experience,highly recommended.","Written May 4, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Definitely worth a visit!,"We went up the Aiguille du Midi as it was included with our Mont Blanc Unlimted Ski Passes and were so glad we did! We took some family that were visiting us too and it was definitely worth the trip.

It was busy and we went first thing in the morning so lots of skiers were going up to ski Vallee Blanche but the cable cars were only about half full on the way back down so we got great views.

Up top it was incredibly cold as it was a fairly windy day so be sure to pack gloves/hat etc! The museum was really interesting, teaching you a lot about climbing in the area. Into the Void was cool if a bit quick as they just let you stand in to take a photo and then usher you away for the next person. Maybe if you come at a quieter time you might get a bit more time to really appreciate standing and looking into ""The Void"". The new tunnel was also a unique way to see the panoramic views and we got to watch ice climbers up here too.

We had thought going early would mean more skiers and less tourists but actually most of the skiers all kitted out with ice picks etc went to all the various viewing platforms, museum etc too as it was their first time up there.

It was great to see the skiers all roped together and watch the initial climb down before they set off to ski Vallee Blanche though. The cafe looked pretty disappointing considering it was in such a great location but we skipped this.

Overall its about ‚Ç¨60 for a return pedestrian ticket but the mont blanc unlimted pass covered this and also allowed us to go skiing later that day so was definitely worth it.","Written May 3, 2019"

France,Aiguille du Midi,Aiguille du Midi,"Breathtaking views from both the first stop up the cable car and the second stop at the top! Definitely worth it if you are in Chamonix. If you buy tickets at the kiosk then you only have to pay ‚Ç¨2pp extra to also get a trip to the ice caves - Mer de Glace - (also definitely worth it) by train through the mountains. Probably cheaper to buy tickets at the kiosk but you have to be at the kiosk before 10am in order to get tickets for both the cable car to the mountain peak & the train to the ice caves in order to do both on the same day as each excursion takes 2-3 hours depending on how long it takes for you to take in the views,take pics, go for toilet breaks, eat at the cafe/restaurant (in both places). The only annoying problem are the queues at the kiosk, to the cable car, and for the train, specially in the mornings/weekends and holiday/peak season, so do check on last cable car or train time back before you decide which site to see first. You can spend time at the first cable car base on the way up or the way back down. Also check the minimum age for children before you buy tickets as I believe there is one so you don't want to have wasted any money on pre-bought non-refundable tickets. Last but not least, if you like trekking and lakes then best to visit Aiguille du Midi in summer when you can walk down a trail (from first base) to a beautiful lake in between the mountains. Unfortunately we visited in April, the mountain was snowed over, so we only got to play in the snow at our first stop up the mountain.","Written April 23, 2019"

France,Aiguille du Midi,Stunning experience,It was absolutely stunning experience for us. I have never been so high - 3482m above see level. It's worth to pay 65euro for the ticket (in that price you have also enter for the train to the glacier 'mer de glace').With Mont-Blanc unlimited pass for one day you can try both atractions in one day like we did. Absolutly must to try!,
France,Aiguille du Midi,Excellent,"OMG !!!

You have to visit this

I travelled from Geneva and visited Chamonix for the first time - took about an hour to get there .....good roads

What an amazing town - lovely restaurants and charming buildings

But the view from 3,500 odd meters up is just breathtaking

This is a must do - to go right to the top for a family of 4 was approx ‚Ç¨195 (so not cheap but worth every ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨ once you are up there !!!!",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Incredible views,"First of all, buy the Chamonix unlimited pass if you plan on also visiting the Aguille du Midi. For ‚Ç¨65 you get access to both (must be same day) and save ‚Ç¨30! - essentially Mer de Glace was free. We also did the Mer de Glace first (no queues) and Aguille du Midi second (again, avoided all queues plus you already have your ticket to board straight away).
You go up in the cable car - do be warned they cram you in - and you change cars half way (you can get out). Cable car takes about 20 mins, not including wait in the middle. Cable car is fun and views are great.
At the top there is not a great deal to do, however we did go in the step into the void which was well worth the wait. Queues can be up to 45 mins plus. There is someone there to take your photo.
Views from the top are stunning, with boards to tell you what you‚Äôre looking at!
Probably spent around one hour here before heading down - it is very cold and the air noticeably thinner.",

Make sure to hire a local guide. A once in a lifetime event for me and I am very happy that I had the chance to ski in Chamonix.,"Written March 27, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Not to be missed!,"If you're visiting Chamonix and it's a clear day, you MUST take the 2 cable cars up to the Aiquille du Midi. We have lived and travelled around the world and this is probably my single favourite spot. Not only are the views spectacular in EVERY direction, but you'll be treated to seeing off piste skiers climbing down to ski the Vallee Blanc (during the winter that is) or rock climbers climbing up to and onto the viewing platforms! If you're really lucky you'll be a foot away from a wing suit jumper as they 'fall' off the mountain. In addition there's a free class floored room where you can have your taken taken for free by the friendly staff. Even if there's low cloud in the valley, check the local weather because quite often it's beautifully blue once the 2nd teleperhique (cable car) takes you above the clouds - it's like looking down on marshmallows!! Since it's at 13,000 feet, people with bad hearts or lungs should think carefully about whether or not to go. Not to be missed!","Written March 25, 2019"
France,Aiguille du Midi,Bit scary but worth it!!,"Visited to spend a special birthday at the top of Europe!! Absolutely amazing once your at the top but a bit daunting getting there! We only had to wait 30 mins to get onto our cable car, you are given a number and called when your ready to board. The cable cars are large but be prepared for a bit of a push and shove as everyone wants a window space. The first trip up is a bit hairy and there were a few screams as it flies over the supporting pillars as it does rock about a bit. The second stage up is really, really daunting as it is practically vertical up the rock face, but you will be so pleased that you made the journey as it is totally amazing!! It‚Äôs what I imagine it‚Äôs like entering heaven or as close as possible!
Be prepared for altitude sickness though- almost immediately by heart wouldn‚Äôt regulate and was thumping really hard, just climbing up stairs leaves you a bit shaky - don‚Äôt panic and take deep breaths, it calms down when your stationery. A few people were struggling but others were totally fine. The views are spectacular, we enjoyed watching the climbers and skiers. We had a beautiful day, although it was chilly it wasn‚Äôt as cold as I though - take a cosy hat and sunglasses. There is a gift shop, restaurant and cafe as well as video shows and small climbing museum- we spent around 2.5 hours there - although I was nervous about trip back down it was much better and a lot easier!! Must do - around ¬£115 for 2 but money well spent.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,Don't miss this and try to ski Vallee Banche,"This is a spectacular, no breathtaking journey to the top of a mountain.

France,Aiguille du Midi,Steep and deep. Amazing,"Take the two stage cable car to the roof of Europe.
There one of the truly excellent mountain guides will rope you down the steep ridge leading to the Valee Blanche
Don‚Äôt even think of going without a guide. Crevasses and avalanche dangers lurk everywhere. With the guide it‚Äôs relatively safe. The run is jaw dropping. If you can ski off piste reds well you have to do this. I am a snowboarder a few flats bring collapsible poles.
Best off piste ride ever.",
France,Aiguille du Midi,"Incredible mountain experience, must do attraction!","The top of the Aiguille du Midi seems like the top of the world on a clear day. The immensity and amplitude of the mountains are impressive. Views like this are rarely accessible without climbing to the top of a crazy peak under your own power. For 67 euros and 20 minutes, you can ride the exciting tram up this snow-draped spire that juts into the azure sky like craggy tooth.

At the top, there is a full on installation with a gift shop, multiple viewing platforms, bathrooms, a museum and more. If you are lucky enough to be there on a clear day, you can peer down into the village far below or out across the Mer de Glace to countless other peaks in the Alps. Of course, you can also stare up at Mount Blanc which goes even higher than this 12,000 ft summit.

Beware, the elevation does get to you, so be sure to drink plenty of water and stay relaxed as you walk around up there!

France,Aiguille du Midi,Even if you do not Ski you have to do it,Climbing up to 3480 m is something to be reckoned with. Most people who come up go skiing or climbing on the nearest glacier. We didn't do either of those. We came to experience being on top of the world. The site of the Mont Blanc company is full of info apart from one crucial thing: it doesn't indicate whether the weather conditions allow or prohibit the ascension. This is a bit of a shame as inexperienced people do not always know to interpret th√®se things alone. We ended up waisting one day just to return the day after to wait impatiently in a line..... Other than that most info is available in various langauges and the facilities are top-notch.,
France,Aiguille du Midi,Jaw Dropping,"We took the train over from Switzerland, which btw is included in the Swiss rail pass, and visited Chamonix.

The final cable car up to the top was closed for repairs so we got out at the stop before that. The view was amazing! I'm not sure I could've gone any higher though I'm sure it is spectacular! This was enough for me anyway and we really enjoyed waking around and taking in the scenery. There was just a dusting of snow on the mountain and the day was clear; only two other people came up while we were there so it was nice to have the place almost to ourselves. If you're a hiker you would love this place! I would recommend getting up early to avoid the crowds.,
France,Aiguille du Midi,Excellent day trip,"Skiing from Aiguille de Midi was my wish for several years and February 25th it comes true.

We started at 9 am at the Aiguille De Midi cable car station where we met our guide. He gave us all the equipment we needed and when we came to the top of the mountain we admired the breathtaking views to the mountains all around. Then our adventure started with a very tricky passing the ridge with all the ski equipment, the crampons are obligatory. It's very icy and was one of the hardest parts and we did it tethered on a rope of our guide. After that, we experienced the unique skiing on the glacier, it was something I will never forget in my life.

We had to climb up with all the ski equipment, actually they were icy steps, the whole climbing took as about half an hour and we came to the hit where we made a half an hour stop. After that we descended to Chamonix but in several parts, the piste was out of the snow, so we had to take our skis off and walk. The whole adventure took us more than five hours.

France,Aiguille du Midi,Highlight of Chamonix visit!,"The ADM Stage 2 was supposed to be closed at the time of our travel in Dec 2018 and I was devastated that we miss the most important land mark in Chamonix. On our 3rd day in Chamonix we decided to just walk over to teh station to check it out as the hotel was just near by(near the SNFC station)
We were pleasantly surprised to see that the stage 2 was open and the queue was starting to move.
It was a different experience. The cable car ride, thought the scenery was amazing, was too crowded. You had to get in first and catch a cprner for a good view.
Stage 1 also was beautiful , but the view from stage 2 cannot be matched. Some parts of the stage 2 like the 'Pipe' was not spectacular, but we all enjoyed the 'Step into the void'

France,Aquarium La Rochelle,Shockingly overcrowded,"The aquarium itself is good, but our experience there in the context of COVID-19 was truly uncomfortable.

We had booked an early evening slot as that appeared to be the least-busy time to go. But it was horribly overcrowded!

Yes there were markings on the ground in the queue outside, yes there was hand gel available, yes people wore masks... but this doesn't get around the fact that there were far too many people clustered together in an enclosed space.

The numbers admitted seem to have been based on surface area, which in the context of an aquarium is simply nonsensical - nobody stands around in the middle of the room; people need to get close to the tanks to see inside them. In the areas with the largest tanks, it was ok, but anywhere containing a series of smaller tanks caused a real backlog.

The only way to show ""civic responsibility"" was to avoid joining the crowds around the tanks - and this meant not seeing much in many of the rooms. And if we tried to see what we had paid to see (having been assured that the numbers of people admitted would be safe), we had to put ourselves and others at risk.

There were even a couple of places where we were stuck in a real bottleneck and there was actually no way out. I found myself holding my breath (a waste of time, I know!).

In hindsight, it was foolish to visit. But we really believed the aquarium would act responsibly and radically cut its numbers (even if this meant charging more for entry)... Unfortunately this is not the case.","Written August 4, 2020"

The aquarium itself is beautiful, however, it was FAR too busy everywhere. We had to stand/walk in line for every tank throughout the whole visit. Especially in corona times, I think it is unacceptable to let so many people in the same time, all the more since you do need to pick a timeframe online to enter the aquarium. Very strange. Even more since the visitors (although wearing the obligatory face mask) also did not keep their distance from each other at all.

The selection of fish can be found at many other aquariums around the world.

France,Aquarium La Rochelle,Part of School Trip.,"Took 43 students from the UK to France for five days. The Aquarium ticket was included in the trip itinerary. Although some students had visited aquariums before they thoroughly enjoyed it. It took us about 90 minutes to take it all in. Even though La Rochelle is a smaller aquarium there was plenty to see and the large tank has sharks and rays. There is an outdoor rainforest section too with a tank of piranhas.
The five teachers that went along took plenty of pictures and found it an informative visit.
The aquarium management kindly let us all sit in their foyer to eat lunch as the weather had been so awful that we could not sit by the harbour.
Plenty of toilets throughout and cupboards to lock belongings in made every much easier. The downside was that the gift shop was overly expensive and although some students did buy gifts I felt that the shop lost out as they could have sold much more if they had products within a lower price range.
Would highly recommend the aquarium to families visiting the area and also as part of a school visit.",
France,Aquarium La Rochelle,A bit crowded yet a nice experience.,"The place is good: it contains thousands of species of sea creatures from all the world, a nice gift shop, good guidance, lots of information, and it's a whole family activity.
The only minus was that some of the aquariums were small, and in a crowded day (like the day I visited) it could take a while moving from one aquarium to another.
Yet, a tour can take 2-2.5 hours which is ok.

A surprising number of visitors were younger couples without children, the La Rochelle Aquarium does have something for almost everyone. Before entering we had lunch at the aquarium restaurant which was a good meal that came with great views of the harbour.

We hadn't expected the Aquarium to be part of our short visit to La Rochelle but we are certainly glad it was.","Written February 11, 2019"

France,Aquarium La Rochelle,Crowded views,"Even though we went out of season (November) and the aquarium itself wasn't particularly busy, we found the display windows small and therefore crowded and it was hard to get a good view into many. It was also a little dated and static compared to many other aquariums we've been to. Plus, once you have completed their assigned loop you cannot go back in so be sure to stop and see everything first time round. (We had come out for lunch but would have had to pay to go back in afterwards!) Having said all that, it was a fun hour and a half for me and the kids.","Written November 6, 2018"

The only downside is that I would like to have seen more sharks but I do understand the conservation aspect and the sea turtles (my favourite) were a little elusive. All in all, a good time out.",

France,Aquarium La Rochelle,Excellent aquarium experience,"My wife and I visited with our one year old daughter on a very hot day in June - we were minded to go anyway but a combination of some good reviews plus the searing heat made up our minds for us.
The pricing is really reasonable - we have paid more to get into aquariums in the UK that were not nearly as good. In fact, we recently visited one so the comparison was 'fresh'. As many have said, the tanks which start at floor level are great for little kids - our daughter didn't want to be in her stroller and this meant she didn't have to be. She loved sitting next to the tank and pretending to be a fish. We really liked the jellyfish exhibit upon arrival, the turtles, and of course the shark tank is awesome - particularly when viewed on the second occasion, as the Sandtiger sharks seem to love swimming into view in a dramatic way.
We spent about 1h 30m in the aquarium but you could do it in an hour and see most stuff (or equally, take two and not get bored).","Written July 1, 2018"

We looked into having a meal at the restaurant there as it did seem reasonably priced, however there was a long wait for this.

The aquarium itself took about 2 hours to walk through and view all of the exhibits. There were a number of interactive exhibits which were great for the children and my wife and I found the visit interesting and definitely worth taking.

We then spent approximately 2 hours wondering around the aquarium and the tropical garden. This was an interesting/educational afternoon and kept two children (11 & 12 year olds) amused.

We've visited a lot of different aquariums with the children and this is one of the better ones we've been too, almost on a par with Nausicaa. The children especially liked all the secret kid sized places to explore.

Being out of season the aquarium was relatively quiet and so there were no issues with crowding or having to skip busy displays. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, both in the main areas, shop and restaurant.

She said it takes two hoirs to activate!!! Ok we should have read the small sign that mentions this at the front...luckily we had all day so we went to the aquarium restaurant which was super child friendly. We ended up going to the aquarium around 17:30 and there was no line but so many people inside and so many kids too, strollers, etc that it was close to impossible to see the window displays right away, a line for everything even the boring areas.

The new rainforest addition was very enjoyable and again a well thought out space. All the staff we came into contact with were friendly and helpful. The facility itself was spotlessly clean.

France,Aquarium La Rochelle,It's ok when quiet!,"We went on a mixed weather day (as did everyone else!). We didn't park in the Aquarium carpark as was full and queuing, but the car park next door had lots of spaces. There was a massive queue just for tickets at the entrance so we went to the tourist information (on the other side of the square) and purchased tickets (no queue!).

The aquarium is rather dark, (and did upset my little one, especially with the volume of visitors). There was queuing at each of the glass windows and there is really 'just fish', with the exception of a few token turtles towards the end.

If you want a day out in La Rochelle, go and visit the fort, climb the 1, 2 or 3 towers, wander around the marina, have lunch around the harbour - save your money on this aquarium (it wasn't cheap!). Even for a 2 and 5 year old the fort climbing and boat watching were better than the Aquarium.","Written August 21, 2017"
France,Aquarium La Rochelle,Well thought out,"I almost didn't go to the aquarium because my wife didn't want to, but am I glad I did! Having worked summers at The Academy of Sciences and Steinhart aquarium in S.F when I was young I was eager to see it. I wasn't disappointed. A clean and well thought out pleasure for the senses. Very easy for groups and wheelchair access, this delight used used subtile lighting and sculptured walls to enhance the wonder and magic of the undersea experience. Great for kids and adults, it begins with a Jules Verne elevator to the bottom where you exit into a tunnel of beautiful jellyfish. The individual tanks are well designed and well positioned for all viewers. Some very large tanks have plenty of room for the BIG scary looking sharks! I was impressed by a few surprises such as a hallway with projected animated fish on the floor that swim out of the way when you try to step on them. Try getting your kids away from that! To top it off the last room is a large, tall rain forest with an indoor waterfall of all things! So okay, the Banyan trees are sculpted, but it's La Rochelle, not the amazon. After, of course, there is a gift shop, but nice.
Two final things, The price is 16‚Ç¨ (buy at your hotel or tourist info to avoid a huge line), but only 40‚Ç¨ for a year-round pass (which is only a little more than a single visit to Steinhart), and the restaurant is surprisingly good, reasonable, great terrace, and overlooks the rain forest and shark tank. Again, I was pleasantly surprised by it all especially after seeing the disaster they made of The Academy of Sciences and Steinhart aquarium in S.F with their shameful new design, but that's another review...","Written August 21, 2017"

Normally in these kind of places I get bored after a few tanks but here that was not the case. And Information was thankfully displayed in English! The cost wasn't too expensive either considering what was on offer.

However .... the aquarium was very busy, crowed control was definitely needed. The vast content of people allowed in was just to great and moreover there were very few members of staff walking around to handle queries.","Written August 20, 2017"
France,Aquarium La Rochelle,"The most incredible aquarium, shame about the alarms","The aquarium in La Rochelle was simply breath taking however unfortunately we had a evacuate the building due to an alarm and after re entering the building the same alarm kept going off again, repeatedly. We went at peak time and it was difficult to get to all the tanks and see them but that cannot be helped. Another set back is that you cannot visit the cafe in the aquarium without leavening and therefore not being able to return to the aquarium, so eat before you go in because you'll spend a good few hours here.",
France,Aquarium La Rochelle,Lots and lots of... People!,"Ok, so it's a rainy day, and this was always going to make it busier, even so, the vast volume of people allowed in to the aquarium is absurd!

At every display, the calm serenity of the sea life within stands in stark contrast to the sweaty, heaving mass of humanity looking in!

We had pre-booked tickets (supposedly to bypass the queue, according to the website) but still has to queue for 20 minutes to get into the building, then for a further ten to get from the foyer into the lift, from which point on, the whole place is absolutely rammed!

Given the substantial price paid for tickets, the whole experience could easily be four stars or more, if only entries were limited to a certain number per hour.

Of course they have audio support (which I haven't tried, so maybe it d have helped...) and a legend on every aquarium but somehow I wish the learning experience in the shape of ""did you know that...?"" would be more emphasized.

One tank seemed a bit small with a large turtle sharing with other fish. Turtle didn't have much space to swim about, being rather large. I know so little about the subject so maybe there is a reason for this.

Luckily we had purchased our tickets ahead of time so that we didn't have to wait in the long line to buy tickets. You can pay 50 cents to check in your coat, which is convenient. I think it's also worth it to pay a little extra to get the audio sets to have detailed explanations about the exhibits. As expected, there were a lot of people visiting on Easter Sunday (afternoon), so we weren't able to appreciate each exhibit and often skipped some when there were too many people. Our three young children did not have the patience to wait until other people moved along, so they went from exhibit to exhibit rather quickly to be able to see the different sea creatures and as we had to follow to make sure we didn't lose them in the crowd, the adults didn't get to enjoy all of the exhibits either. Still, the variety of sea creatures is impressive and the aquarium is well laid out. I think we spent an hour total, so it was a short visit...therefore expensive for the time we spent there. If you go on a less busy day and maybe without kids that are too young, I'm sure you could spend a couple of hours there to really appreciate all that the aquarium has to offer.

There was also a little tunnel under one tank for children the view a tank from beneath. The shop had a wide variety of items from pocket-money upwards.

Definitely allow several hours for your visit so you have time to really enjoy each section which is an ocean of the world and just to sit and watch the creatures as there is so much to take in. We saw so many fish which were weird and wonderful and can't believe they exist!
My partner had the headset but to be honest you really don't need it unless you are an information person as there is plenty to read in English, he occasionally told me something out loud which I enjoyed hearing but not necessary!
My daughter really enjoyed the tunnel which takes you behind the fish tank, and we did this several times.
Everything about the place is amazing, but the best part for us was seeing the turtles at the end in the forest, they were so up close and seemed so happy it was lovely to see.
We parked in the maritime car park just up the road which is free and is a couple of minutes walk (it the one with the big colourful building in it).
Definitely somewhere to visit if you are in the area and we shall do so again when we visit France in the future.",

Close to the port with parking right outside. We didn't queue at all but I can imagine on a rainy day there may be queues. Family tickets are available (2 adults, 3 children) which were quite a bit cheaper. There was an option of an audio tour which we didn't take so cannot comment, however lots of the information boards had an english translation so there was no real problem.

Lots of beautiful fish, jellyfish, turtles and of course sharks. An educational section right at the end too which was very good. It feels quite large and there is so much to see. It has some very 'normal' fish too such as cod which amazed our children (and me too, they're huge!)

All in all a great display and highly recommended.",

If you use sat nav directions, the car park is huge and close to the other main attractions of the town.
I've been to a few aquariums over the years but this one is the best. If you go earlier in the day it's not that busy, so it gives you the best chance to see the exhibits without clambering over hoards of visitors. It's very well set out and each turn you make in the building takes to some vast tanks in excellent condition with the fish looking healthy. The tanks are impeccably clean so no problems seeing through the glass. A good mix of fish and other marine animals makes this an interesting place to visit for your kids too.

The aquarium itself was a great visit and kept the two little ones fully engaged, the written descriptions are mostly in French with some English translations so you may wish to consider the audio guide if you are looking for a deeper understanding.

France,Aquarium La Rochelle,Good...just choose your timing carefully...,We clearly decided to do what lots of other people do on a rainy day and go look at the aquarium in la rochelle. We arrived mid afternoon and were faced with an hour in the queue. Looking at other reviews it seems like prebooking would have avoided that but there you go. It was very busy with buggies everywhere and so a lot of the smaller exhibits were hard to get close to. We've been to London aquarium and I'm not sure there's much to choose between the two although this one did feel like you were not being herded out in a continuously moving mass. The latter exhibits on the upper floor were definitely better than the earlier ones and paying the extra for an English commentary on headphones was worth a few euro extra - just take some photo ID otherwise you won't be allowed to take one. All in all a reasonable half day out but maybe not one for a wet daytime - either go later or on a brighter day.,"Written August 20, 2016"
France,Aquarium La Rochelle,World class,We bought our tickets on line from the Aquarium website planning to avoid the queue as we had only a couple of hours. Big mistake. the scanners could not recognise the bar codes on my phone and it took half an hour to sort out. Eventually we got in. My other peeve was that despite no flash photography signs everywhere some people insisted on taking dozens of photos of their little darlings with the fish with flash. Having got that off my chest I ahve to say this is a superb aquarium with beautifully lit and varied displays. Loved the sea horse and wired triffid things.,
France,Aquarium La Rochelle,Amazing and fascinating,"A visit to the aquarium was one of the first things we did in La Rochelle. We spent over two hours in there - there was so much to see. The exhibits were well laid out with information about each of the species. There were some interactive exhibits for children and for adults. What most impressed me was the conservation aspect - seeing the cultivation of corals taking place etc. - and the amazing variety of sea life, most of which we had never seen before.

There are loads of different marine animals and some but not all the displays have English translations. To be honest the boys really enjoyed it and even though it was busy ( it is the height of summer) there were only a few areas where it got a little cramped generally there was enough space around the different tanks to comfortably view.

We took numerous picnics on our trips round and had lovely lunches at different locations with different magnificent views.

Swimming in the lake is also a joy, as the water in August/September is a delightful temperature and this lake has the purest water compared to any other French lake. It‚Äôs fabulous, especially swimming from the little ‚Äòbeach‚Äô at S√©vrier.

France,Lake Annecy,A beautiful area to visit,"I have visited lake Annecy several times for different reasons. If you are an outdoor activity person then you will have plenty to do. There is also an abundance of gastronomic delights. On the edge of the Savoie region it offers fantastic mens for meat lovers as well as vegetarians.

The lake is beautiful and very warm in summer to swim. Only draw back is the restricted areas where you are allowed to swim. If you don‚Äôt have a car, transportation around the lake is difficult outside school holidays as buses are restricted. I took my cycle and so this wasn‚Äôt an issue.

The surrounding mountains are beautiful for walk and cycling through. Semnoz put Annecy on the map for roadie cyclists when it first featured in Le Tour.

You can get there very easily by flying to Geneva (and possibly Chambery) and then taking one of numerous coach‚Äôs from the airport (more expensive but quicker) or down town which is a 5 min walk from the station. The train leaves the airport every 10 mins and takes 7 mins to do the one stop. You can also collect a free train ticket from the baggage collection area in the airport.

Secondly the boat was very easy to control and finally, a ‚Äúpay on return‚Äù system (in 15 min increments) meant we weren‚Äôt watching the clock and trying to make it back by a certain time.

We usually stay by the old city to do everything on foot, then rent a boat for a few hours to enjoy the lake, wakeboard, wakesurf or just chill in the middle away from the tourists.

If you go further in the mountains, you can also paraglide and do canyoning

Otherwise, there are beaches (some you need to pay, but then, it's less crowded) where you can relax or rent stand-up paddle boards, pedal boats, canoes, kayaks, etc.

France,Lake Annecy,Simply the best!,"Lac d'Annecy has it all -- swimming and cycling, rambling and hiking for outdoorsy types, and for the rest of us, lovely boat rides, history-laden streets and architecture, urban shopping, food markets and restos, and quaint, peaceful villages far from the madding crowds.. Try not to go to Annecy itself at peak tourist season (for instance, Bastille Day weekend), when the lanes of the old town are a little too packed for comfort, but even then one can simply hop on the Lac d'Annecy water taxi and escape to one of the charmingly tranquil villages across the lake. (Check schedules with the Tourism Office and get there early; the boats only accommodate 12 people, plus bikes. If there's no boat to get you back to Annecy later in the day, you can catch a bus from some of the villages.) In Talloires, probably the loveliest of these tiny towns, replete with its own ""old town,"" very good eateries, and a delightful beach, it's also possible to take a free ""econavette"" up the mountain behind it (a lot more relaxing than driving the twisting road oneself, and better for the enviroment) for magnificent scenery and a meal at one of the two restaurants there. The more daring can walk a bit further up and join the flocks of gliders soaring up above from the paragliding/handgliding stations. Another beautiful day trip -- by car, bike or bus -- is up another curving mountain road to Semnoz, a park with more extraordinary views, perfectly clean air, and an ""artisanal"" cheese shop with some excellent local products (though the unpleasant woman behind the counter had the distinction of providing our only negative encounter in 6 days in Annecy). Despite the cheese lady, we can't recommend Annecy highly enough!","Written August 14, 2019"

France,Lake Annecy,"Spectacular scenery, but be careful of all the cyclists and take swim things to go to the beach","We drove to Annecy from Chamonix which was about 1 hour 10 minutes‚Äô drive away. It was a weekday in the height of summer on a beautiful sunny hot day. The traffic was fine and it wasn‚Äôt as bad driving into Annecy as I‚Äôd been led to believe. It was only a few minutes after arriving in Annecy that we found all the signs to the car parks and parked up fairly quickly. Getting out of Annecy and back to Chamonix that evening seemed far more complicated actually and there were various turnings we nearly missed even though Chamonix was written on the signs at all the junctions.

We were going to park in the Hotel de la Ville car park which had been recommended in reviews, although reviewers had suggested that the entrance was narrow so we weren‚Äôt looking forward to that in an SUV. As it was we found another car park before we go to where we were aiming for - the Bonlieu I think it was called. You take a ticket on the way in then there are 2 underground levels. It was a little tight on some of the corners but the spaces themselves were a good size and it was one of those car parks where the floor squeaks on your wheels as it‚Äôs all painted and glossy. So it was a nice looking car park. The payment machines were a bit hard to find and we didn‚Äôt really spot any signage but just came across them in the middle of the level of our car park. We were able to pay with our foreign credit card (uk) although the contactless didn‚Äôt work. We‚Äôd read somewhere that sometimes the car park machines don‚Äôt accept foreign credit cards. I couldn‚Äôt see anywhere to pay by cash but maybe I missed that because we didn‚Äôt need to use cash as our card worked.

We liked the location of the car park - upstairs was where the tourist office was and some book shops and cafes, and most importantly some toilets. So these were handy for arriving and leaving and also when we popped back to the car to pick up swim things. Once you are out of the car park you are very near the lake and also the old town.

Annecy was really beautiful - there‚Äôs a glorious greeny coloured crystal clear lake surrounded by hills/mountains, and lots of colourful flowers everywhere. The only thing that‚Äôs bad is all the bikes everywhere - there are dedicated cycle lanes all over the place but the cyclists like to cycle super fast through all the pedestrians all the time so it was quite hair-raising getting about safely with two boys (5 and 7) who don‚Äôt necessarily always walk in a straight line when they think they‚Äôre on a wide pedestrian path away from the dangers of a road. So we had to keep hold of them more than we usually would on pedestrian paths surrounded by grass.

The first thing we did was hire a motor boat - there are lots of places hiring boats and we didn‚Äôt notice any difference between the various establishments. We chose somewhere called ‚Äòles Canetons‚Äô. They had pedalo boats for various numbers of people and I think those boats with slides off them but we wanted a motor boat. You pay when you get back (it costs more or less depending on how long you‚Äôre out on the lake for). They only take cash and the person before us didn‚Äôt have any cash and the nearest cash machine was quite a long walk away in the heat from what we could gather.

We spent about half an hour in our boat. The children were given life jackets and we had to take our shoes off to move around in the cushions at the front of the boat. There‚Äôs a bit of shade where the person steering the boat sits and instruction is given about which way to go and how to know which area you can go in so that you avoid swimmers near the shore etc. As the lake is so large you don‚Äôt have to spend a lot of time avoiding other boats. The boys really loved the boat ride around the lake. Some people stop the boat and swim off the side of the boat but we didnt think the boys were strong enough swimmers for that.

There are lots of playgrounds for the children around the lake, somewhat unexpectedly. There were two quite close to one another near the lake not far from our car park and then also one of those outdoor gyms which the boys enjoyed too near the boat hire. The only slightly odd thing was that there weren‚Äôt places near this part of the lake where you could just get a coffee and maybe a croissant. There was one bar/restaurant with inside and outside seating but we‚Äôd sat in the wrong place apparently as we weren‚Äôt eating a meal and when we were moved in an unfriendly way we were next to a very smokey table so in the end we walked back to the old town and found somewhere for coffee there. Even then it wasn‚Äôt as easy to find somewhere as we‚Äôd imagined as lots of places just seem to serve food and aren‚Äôt keen on people turning up just wanting drinks especially when they accidentally sit at a table where you have to order food. We had a few unfriendly situations with restaurants because of this (for example Brasserie du Paquier where we ended up leaving before our drinks arrived as they were so unfriendly once they found out we weren‚Äôt ordering a meal!). It‚Äôs a bit risky just sitting down at a spare table if you‚Äôre not sure whether it‚Äôs one reserved for eating meals but often there aren‚Äôt any waiting staff nearby to ask.

The old town reminded me a bit of Venice with canals with bridges dotted all over the place, and really old multi coloured buildings along the canals. It was too hot though to explore much with the boys. So after a lovely family-friendly quick tasty lunch at La Galejade overlooking the canal/river (which had good clean toilets and friendly waiting staff) we got our swim things out of the car and headed over to one of the ‚Äòbeaches‚Äô around the lake shore. They‚Äôre called beaches but there‚Äôs absolutely no sand as far as I could see so I wasn‚Äôt sure that was the appropriate terminology. It was quite a walk round the lake in the blazing heat to get to the nearest beach which was Plage de l‚Äôimperial but we made it.

You had to pay to get in (it looked like there was a credit card machine although we used cash) - the price list had all sorts on it which we didn‚Äôt really understand, possibly to do with hiring sunloungers?) so we just paid for a standard family ticket.

There was a lovely man-made paddling pool for the boys with little slides and fountains and sprayers etc and then they took it in turns to go swimming with their dad in the actual lake. They loved it and we spent a happy 2 hours there cooling down in the water. There were lots of little babies enjoying the water too - it seemed fairly safe for them.

It was pretty busy on such a hot day but we managed to find some shade to lay our towels down. At first we couldn‚Äôt see where the changing area was as there are no signs but it turned out there were changing rooms in the building immediately to your left when you pay to go in. These are quite large individual lockable rooms with a chair. You could fit a whole family in if you needed to. There were toilets in the same building but I could only see 2 cubicles in the ladies toilet. There was no toilet paper by the time we arrived and they weren‚Äôt the cleanest toilets ever but you can‚Äôt expect much near a beach in my experience.

We couldn‚Äôt see any lockers which would have been helpful for our wallets, cameras and phones etc. In the end we just put our rucksack at the side of the paddling pool where we were with the boys and kept an eye on it.

We‚Äôd brought swim shoes with us but no-one was really wearing these. No-one wore swim shoes in the paddling pool although my husband saw a few people wearing them in the main lake which had just a normal stoney lake floor. There are signs up saying you can‚Äôt wear wet suits/swim tops/swim trousers. But in the paddling pool some children did have on neoprene all-in
-one outfits and swim t shirts. Men could wear swim shorts rather than having to wear speedos like you have to at public swimming pools in France.

Lots of children had inflatables and were wearing various floats etc and water guns and also some had goggles on although we didn‚Äôt feel these were needed. The glare from the water is quite bright though so I was wearing sun glasses. Some were wearing swim hats although we didn‚Äôt see people in the lake wearing hats. It‚Äôs always difficult to know what‚Äôs allowed. Without swim shoes it was fine in the paddling pool as the bottom of the pool wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable to stand on. To get to the pool you walked on grass and then concrete pavement which was a bit hot but bearable. There are lifeguards but they had their back to the paddling pool; they were just watching the lake itself. The paddling pool is for children up to age 10 but parents of little ones were in there too.

The water temperature was lovely on such a hot day and the views were amazing. The main lake has water slides apparently but we didn‚Äôt use these. There seemed to be large inflatables on sale.

Lots of people had prams with them and parasols so there didn‚Äôt seem to be restrictions on how much stuff you could bring in with you.

There was volleyball and table tennis and a free playground. There‚Äôs also a bigger play area with trampolines and mini golf etc but you had to pay extra to enter that area. There‚Äôs also another (free) playground immediately outside the entrance to the beach where you pay, which we didn‚Äôt have time to go on.

It looks like there‚Äôs a restaurant in the beach area but we didn‚Äôt end up buying any refreshments other than a bottle of cold water from the dispenser near the entrance.

We were fortunate that just as we were leaving the beach the road train was just about to set off back to Annecy old town so we hopped on that and got a lift back to pretty much outside where we‚Äôd parked. It wasn‚Äôt too much to pay and certainly worth us not having to lug all our swim stuff back to the car in the blazing heat. I‚Äôve no idea how frequent the trains are though - we were just very lucky to get on one straight away.","Written August 9, 2019"

One morning when we got up there was a ""farmers market"" going on...that was so much fun!

We found the people to be very friendly and helpful especially given our nonexistent French. They generally try to speak English which in France isn‚Äôt always the case.
If you decide to visit here-and you definitely should- try to avoid August or at least August weekends. It is hot and crowded like Christmas holiday at Disney.",
France,Lake Annecy,Excellent cycling,We are a family of five with two teenagers and another 10 year old . We hired bikes in Annecy and cycled to the end of a very well made tarred bicycle route which is basically flat making cycling relatively easy . The bicycle shop in Annecy was easy to find with friendly and efficient staff . We did the entire west side of the lake . There is a route to completely go round the lake but on the east side the bicycle route is more challenging and we are not experienced cyclers . The scenery was amazing . In August the track was very busy and all the time fast cyclists are overtaking but this did not detract from the experience. We stopped alongside the lake for lunch . Tip : if you want s good beach the best ones are close to Annecy. Further along the lake the public beaches are small . We did four hours of cycling and returned to the old town for a well deserved and excellent ice cream .,"Written August 19, 2018"
France,Lake Annecy,Wow.,"The public beach gets SUPER crowded; so either go very very early or pay for the Prive Plage near the Imperial Palace (only ‚Ç¨4) to have more space and also a chaise lounge. Just gorgeous and water is super clear.

France,Lake Annecy,Simply beautiful,"I think this lake might be the most attractive thing about Annecy. If you have the good fortune of visiting on a day with good weather (which I did not, sadly), you should definitely try to get out on the water. I was planning on taking a paddleboat out, so that‚Äôs one option. But if you get seasick easily, it can be just as nice to walk along the lakeshore at the Jardins de l‚ÄôEurope or the Paquier and feel the breeze coming off the water.","Written August 12, 2018"

France,Lake Annecy,Beautiful and stunning. Something for everyone!,"We spent 4 glorious days in Annecy. We had planned to travel, cycle and hike. However, there was so much to do around the lake that we didn't leave the lakeshore. The lake is shallow in many places for some distance from the shore making it perfect for families. There is loads to do, from pedalos, paddle boards to motor boats. The lake bed is virtually rock free. We stopped in some of the bathing areas. There was plenty of eating places to choose from and during the hot afternoons we moved to the parks and joined families having picnics in the cool shade. It was great to sit and listen to the sounds of people having fun relaxing around this beautiful lake.","Written August 7, 2018"
France,Lake Annecy,A lovely place but why are the people so rude?,"From the aggressive staff working in the SNCF ticket office to staff in restaurants and cafes, we found people acted like they really didn't want us there.

France,Lake Annecy,Beautiful hikes above the lake,"It‚Äôs one thing to enjoy Lake Annecy by boat or swim. It‚Äôs quite another to experience it from high above. The Mont Veyrier and Mont Baron hike, with a trailhead just 20 minutes by car from the city center, was stunningly beautiful (at least in one direction). And pretty hard too. Fortunately most of it is in the underbrush, so even on a hot day it‚Äôs still shaded for most of the hike.

FYI the trails are not particularly well marked, so get an app like Mhikes to provide some GPS guidance. And half of the loop isn‚Äôt picturesque at all (in fact part of it appears to be the work of a bulldozer simply blazing a trail). But the views...wow...totally worth it.",
France,Lake Annecy,"Beautiful lake, certainly no secret","There are many beautiful, mountain-rimmed lakes in Europe, Lake Annecy being among them. This one has long since been discovered and is quite busy during the summer. There are all sorts of water craft available for rent. Biking around the lake is a favorite activity. Annecy is within easy reach of Lyon or Geneva for a day trip. If looking for another candidate to rival the beauty of Lake Annecy, check out Lake Bled in Slovenia.",
France,Lake Annecy,Beautiful lake - Plage de Marquisats,"We visited here as a family in July. Dotted around the lake are a series of small beaches - many have free public parking. The beaches allow you access to the lake where you can swim or paddle in shallow, life guard protected waters.

Most locals go early, and by 11am parking was only available if you waited for a space to come clear. Lovely for a few hours!","Written July 31, 2018"
France,Lake Annecy,Bike around for great views,"In the summer your options for activities in and around the lake are limitless.

France,Lake Annecy,Beautiful Annecy and lake,"So much has been written about the lake and it‚Äôs surrounding but it is hard to do Annecy justice. There is something for everyone here. In the old town restaurants abound and there is much to see and on the lake there is every form of water sports.
We hired a speed boat for an hour rather than take the organised trip around the lake and there was plenty of time to explore and enjoy seeing the scenery from the water.
Driving up into the mountains reveals stunning views.
We stayed 20 minutes walk away from the lake at Cran Grevier so accommodation is cheaper to find and there are plenty of buses if you don‚Äôt like walking. We just followed the river in to the lake under the shade.
We highly recommend it but make sure that you get air conditioning once the heat kicks in or you will regret it.","Written July 16, 2018"

Motor boats can be rented for 30-70 Euros a half hour (depending on size)‚Äîthere are numerous locations along the shore in the area along the promenade Jaquet. Or you can take a boat tour with others. Such tours can be rented from le Vasse, next to the Pont des Amours. A 35 minute circuit of the lake costs about 10 Euros a person. The pilot explains things as you go, and the length and width of the lake are traversed. Beautiful views, strikingly aqua water, and a great way to enjoy a day with nice weather.","Written July 3, 2018"

We walked around much of the lake one day stopping off for food and drinks at beautiful lakeside setting. The crystal clear waters are amazing and surrounded by a beautiful backdrop of mountains. Many people were cycling around the lake which was also dotted with people of all ages relaxing playing sunbathing and generally socialising. We took a motor boat on the lake for an hour at the cost of ‚Ç¨60 where we enjoyed a mini picnic courtesy of produce from the local market, all recommended.

Then you have the history and the gorgeous old buildings. The water in this lake is so clear you can see straight to the bottom. I fell in love with this city!",
France,Lake Annecy,"Wow, what a place!! stunning beautiful highly recommended","Drove down from England, stopped a couple of times for the night on the way down, stopped in Troyes on the way down and Reims on the way back, very nice towns to stop in. Annecy is a stunning place, lovely see through lake, mountains, Chamonix Mont Blanc only an hour away, must see venue, take the red train up the mountain to see a glacier which is truly breathtaking, from up there it looks like a winding road but staggeringly its 3/4 of a mile wide, totally underestimated the scale of it. Carvings in the Glacier is truly epic. Back to Annecy now, we stopped in La Revoir campsite, beautiful place not far from lake and cycle track, Julie is lovely as well as all the staff, stopped in a static caravan for 10 days, very comfortable. Hired bikes which was great but the thrill was Para gliding off the side of a mountain over the lake on a parachute with pilot behind you, no engine just you the pilot and a piece of fabric at 4500 ft. You keep going up with the thermals and are in the air for about 30 minutes, you glide over the lake and land in a field about 5 miles away, truly stunning experience, ¬£85 euro each with ¬£30 euro for go pro SD card and stills, well worth it (¬£75 euro kids) just a long drive home so definitely need some pit stops on the way back home. DFDS ferry lovely on the way down, P&O ferry terrible on the way back, where the hell they got this thing from god only knows, belongs in the knackers yard, it was the pride of ""Something"" seriously P&O!! take the pride off the side of it and sink it to save you any more embarrassment. Staff nice though. So Annecy, a lovely place but if I went again as I did with my wife and 2 teenage daughters I would fly into Geneva and hire a car. No more beach holidays for us, too boring, need a bit of excitement, and we found that in Annecy. Thanks, Ant, Sarah, Lily Mae and Hattie.....","Written June 10, 2018"

We arrived on a monday after flying into geneva and getting free train to city then walking to bus station nearby and getting coach to annecy, fairly inexpensive but leaves every 3 hours so we had an hour or so to kill . We had a delicious swiss hot chocolate on the banks of the river while we waited for the coach.

The coach took about 1.5 hours and was very straight forward. Train was complicated and took far longer, taxi would be about 125e. What i would advise is to get daytime flights as there doesnt seem to be much in the way of coaches before 9am.","Written June 8, 2018"

France,Lake Annecy,Canyoning with Monte Medio,"We had a great time doing canyoning by the lake. The Monte Medio company has existed for twenty years and is since three years back managed by Raimon Isnart and his wife. They have a small place half an hour south of Annecy down by the lake side just outside a camping site. After putting on the wet suits (good brand according to my daughter) the family walked up in the forest above the lake to reach the place on the river where the canyoning would start. This walk took around twenty minutes on a quite slippery path in the beautiful forest. Since I didn't participate in the actual river descent I had to walk back along the same path down to the lake. I must confess I was a bit nervous about the family, and especially how my wife would cope. Raimon was a safe guide down the river however and the family was very happy when they finally reached the lake after almost two hours and could end the experience with a bath in the lake together with a couple of swans.",

France,Lake Annecy,Glacial Lake,"If visiting Annecy you really should just give the lake a look. It is pretty and kept very clean. From Annecy you can easily drive all the way around on good roads and it takes about two hours or so depending on traffic. What you will not do is see much of the lake from the road as I did not notice anything in the way of viewpoint car pull offs intended for sight seeing. This leaves either a lake cruise or renting a boat. Either are easy. We chose to go on the one hour cruise from the park which takes around 20 people right down to other end of the lake with a French commentary along the way. (Helpful guide‚Äôs English is good enough for the odd question). Along the way he will point out various chateaux, notable villages, Napoleon‚Äôs Hat rock feature and the flicks of hang gliders that can find lift at various points. There is some explanation that the lake was caused by glaciation and is about 60 metres deep but also has some unusual shallow spots and even a natural beach.",

France,Lake Annecy,T-Shirt Mountaineering,"What a brilliant place. We were very lucky with the weather, we arrived in mid October and it was sunny and warm for the duration of our stay which was 5 nights. Another added bonus was that we missed out on the massive crowds that must be here during the height of summer or in the dead of a snowy winter. The only downside of this was that the outdoor swimming had pretty much closed down for the winter but you could, if you wished, still swim in the swimming area down by the Casino.

Prior to going to Annecy I was trying to figure out how easy it was to go cycling with young children - eleven and eight. Either due to my ineptitude on the internet or the lack of information available, I was unable to figure out much more than that there is traffic free cycling down the west side of the lake but it was unclear as to the extent of this or how traffic free the route was. In GB it can be a bit of Russian roulette regarding how traffic free a cycle route might be.

When we arrived there were bikes everywhere and cycling in the old town is easy enough as it is mostly pedestrianised, bikes seem to be allowed everywhere. There are also numerous cycle paths throughout the rest of the town.

The route down the west side of the Lake starts about 50 yards from where the bike rental shop is situated, next to the cruise boats. It is indeed traffic free for the entire extent of the distance we managed to cover right down to the castle on the lakeside. There are subways beneath the busy roads the route crosses. I was very happy and comfortable with the route for my children. A cyclist will describe the route as flat but there are a few very small undulations; both children managed fine. I found all the information regarding the cycling available in the bike rental shop.

In order to find out how else we might explore the area I visited the Tourist Information Office, the staff here were welcoming, friendly and helpful. The tourist office is situated in a modern 'shopping centre' at the end of the Canal du Vasse about two minutes walk northwest (ish) of the Pont des Amours. When there I purchased two maps for about 18 Euro in total (IGN 1:25,000 Lac d'Annecey 3431 OT and 29 Dicovery Walks in English)

We chose to complete walk eleven which is described on the map as a Red Route: quite difficult, suitable for more experienced and fitter walkers (higher (steeper) gradients and longer route times)). This takes you up the nearest of the mountains to the east of the town and the one you can see rising above the north end of the lake opposite Pont des Amours. The walk was fantastic we ascended the 'back' way intending to come down the 'front' way. It may be better to go the other way. We drove from the town following Sat nav to the car park at Col des contrebandiers, which is a joy in itself and took about 40 minutes. At the car park there are boards with information on the routes and the routes are all waymarked. Some helpful locals helped us decide which way to go. The routes give approximate times for each of the routes. It is about the same whichever way you choose to go round. The route we chose was in the shade of the mountain as we were going up the 'back' (dip slope) of the mountain. The other route would have been in the sun more as you quickly ascend to the top of the scarp slope. (Which is a massive cliff). At the top there is a bench where you can take in the spectacular views across the valley taking in the beauty of the landscape and the town of Annecy. We began the descent towards a viewing platform which we could see in the distance and was on the route back to the car park but... the level of exposure to the right (west) was high, effectively walking along the top of the cliff on a steeply sloping exposed rock surface for some of the way. We decided to go back the way we came as I did not know how severe it might get and I did not trust my scampering kids not to go over the edge. Having said this we saw French people with babies strapped to their chests doing it, so it could not have been that bad. Lilly livered britishers. The view from the top of Mont Baron, 1,299 m, was worth a lovely walk up through the heavily wooded and shaded side of the mountain. The weather was brilliant and we were in our T shirts all the way and it was really hot in the sun at the top. If walking up hills is your thing Annecy is great place. The whole trip took about 4 hours.

The other map which is more detailed shows most of the forest and mountain walks that you can go on and you can actully walk up the mountain from the town this would probably take a whole day though. The route is waymarked from the Casino. Our kids loved the adventure of it. We will definitely be doing more of this and be taking proper gear to do more of the hills and mountains around Annecy.

We went with the intention of exploring the area and did so by car, bicycle and on foot. One of the highlights was an hours drive to Chamonix to ascend the cable car to the Aguile du Midi which is just below the peak of Mt Blanc. The children loved this as it was terrifying for us scaredy-cats. The cable car rises in two 1,500 metre or so stages, one of which is above an enormous abyss of snow and rock. Once on the top we were all slightly affected by the altitude but we spent a good two hours there. The cost of the trip for the family was about ¬£200 so stay as long as you can. We purchased coffee and cake at the top and it was not unreasonably priced. The whole place defies description and we could not help asking ourselves, how did they build this? Luckily there is a lot of information about this in the cable car housing. If you are able to tear yourself away from the views you can spend a good long time answering this question. We stopped at the halfway point and got out on the mountain side (you are not alowed out at the top unless you are proper serious) and had our picnic in the sun while playing in the snow. If we had known that we could get out here we would have brought proper shoes so we could do the short walks which were signposted from the station, one of which was a fifteen minute walk to a small lake. of course we were in our T shirts although we had gone fully wrapped in our winter woollies, a necessity as it is well below zero at the top and cold when not in the sun. We kept an eye the weather during our week long stay so we could pick the best weather to go. Needles to say ¬£200 to look at some cloud from the inside would not be worth it. The views from the top, 3842m, were amazing.

We stayed in an apartment in the old town of Annecy which was beautiful and we could walk everywhere.

I went to the other 4 or 5 stars hotel along the lake for lunch.
They opened for only dinner time.
There was no guest.
I asked the staff politely if I might use the restroom.

France,Gorges de la Restonica,Amazing nature,Swim in the natural pools in fresh spring water in quiet natural enviroment in hot summer days are so refreshing and energized.,
France,Gorges de la Restonica,"Crazy road, beautiful scenery, challenging walk","God knows who in their right mind thought this road with sheer drops and not enough space to pass did not need crash barriers?! I found this rather cynical of whichever authority is in charge of this road. We, like many others, were exhausted by the time we got to the car park - it‚Äôs a bloody white-knuckle drive.
Having said all that, restonica is stunningly beautiful. Once you‚Äôve survived the drive you‚Äôre in glorious mountain/ waterfall/ rivers/ rocks heaven. We were there in late September on a sunny, cloudless day and the climate was lovely - no need for a fleece. In cloudier weather this would‚Äôve been different as temperatures are probably 10 degrees lower than by the coast.
We‚Äôre keen walkers but not experienced hikers, and I suffer from vertigo, so this was always going to be a fairly difficult hike for us (Also, we‚Äôre averagely fit and middle aged). We went about 80% up the way to lac melo and then turned round - not because it became undoable but because we‚Äôd had enough excitement of climbing up over rocks by then. From the car to the spot where we turned round (with water breaks and taking photos etc), we‚Äôd been climbing for about 1hr 45. It took us almost the same time to get back. To be fair, there were plenty of people faster than us, leaping past like gazelles.
We had taken the ‚Äòeasy‚Äô path (there‚Äôs a choice after the higher up berberie hut - left through woods or right along sheer rocks). I think both paths may be similar in difficulty but the left path is less scary, easier for people who struggle with heights, but still quite a scramble and climb over rocks. Just watching people taking the right route made me get sweaty palms though... But then, this may just be me. I did see people with children going up, even carrying babies... but there are a lot of slippery rocks, drops, and further up chains and ladders.
My advice to people who aren‚Äôt sure if this is for them: you‚Äôre going to be ok on the drive, just take it really slowly. Try to avoid driving when you‚Äôll encounter a lot of traffic coming the other way - so go up before noon and go down after 3pm. The really early birds might have less traffic on the mountain and less midday sun but they‚Äôll drive down with loads of oncoming traffic which will be a nightmare.
As to the walk, if you struggle with heights, take the left route after the 2nd hut and just keep the option open of turning round. I would‚Äôve liked to make it to the lake (and probably would have) but I didn‚Äôt mind turning round when we did and loved the stunning scenery all the same, making it to the top or not.","Written September 24, 2019"

France,Gorges de la Restonica,Wonderful Hike,"The walk up the gorge is wonderful, the views looking back down the gorge are stunning!

To walk up to the Lac de Melo, the first lake, took about 1h 10 minutes and it took about 1h 30 to come down. Walking up is moderately rocky but you don't need to be an expert climber to walk up it. A moderate level of fitness is advisable and if you're abit unsure it'd be worth getting walking sticks. If you are driving, make sure that you drive to the lattermost car-park

The hikes are well marked out, and as it's quite busy, I think it would be difficult to get lost.

We didn't have a car with us so we got a train to Corte and then hitch-hiked into the gorge. I was abit nervous about this at first, but as there is only 1 road into the gorge, it's quite easy to do and the people who drove us where really nice. If you want to hitch-hike, make sure to walk from the station to start of the D623 - this is the road which goes into the gorge.

There were some places to get food at the start of the hike, but I would recommend getting food and water packed in advance as you will get hungry as you climb. Also make sure to bring layers as your temperature will fluctuate depending on where you are.

It sounded horrendous, and that was my nerves finished. At first we tried heading on up, but eventually I begged my husband to turn around. Yes, the poor man turned around on that narrow single lane track, which was probably more dangerous than completing the route, but I was finished. Kudos to my husbands driving skills!

We stopped at the bottom, grabbed our towels and went for a swim in the crystal clear water in the pools. Every family and group just claims a pool to themselves and it is way more relaxing than that terrifying road. Getting down to the water requires a fare amount of agility, so I would definitely not recommend this outing for people with any physical mobility limitations.",
France,Gorges de la Restonica,Delightful valley,"A lovely valley with stopping off points for relatively strenuous walks. A significant amount of the road is single track with passing places, so can be challenging at busy times.","Written September 28, 2018"
France,Gorges de la Restonica,More difficult than expected,"The drive was quite an adventure, fortunately I wasn't driving. We got to the parking at about noon and there was still queue of cars heading up with occasional car going down. We had to park about 1km far from start of the track (parking is 6 Euro). Even though it was mid September the track was really busy and fairly challenging - with boulders, ladder and chains. My husband is scared of heights and he felt uneasy in parts. It took us 50 minutes to get to the first lake and another 45 to the second one where we had a swim. We had to rescue a dog and his owner as they tried to climb a steep part with chains. Unless you have a super dog I wouldn't take it there. Wear good hiking shoes and carry plenty of water. There are two paths to the first lake - on each side of the river. Altogether it was 4.5 hours trip with lunch and swim at the top.","Written September 26, 2018"
France,Gorges de la Restonica,Breathtaking (in a double senses),"To begin: we (family with seven year old) are used to do sometimes walking and hiking tours, but with no special difficulties or special equipment. We don't count us among the sporty people, but the common sunshine-walkers.

We entered the Gorges de la Restonica at about noon and expected doing a little promenade to the two lakes. As our Michelin guide didn't mention some special requirements, apart from good shoes, and indicated a nearly four-five hour back-and-forth-trip, we were optimistic to do this short walk with our seven year old daughter.

As you may have guessed already, the way to the lac de Melo (and even more the one to the lac de Capitello) were not easy at all and we needed much more time than announced. Although we made two short breaks at the lakes, we took seven and a half hour (count six and a half walking time). The path is very steep and you have to take high steps to come further ... especially for our seven-year-old. Do not underestimate the effort!

However, I have to admit that the extraordinary view on the Lac de Melo, but even more the one at the Lac de Capitello are absolutely worth this quite difficult hiking tour and we would certainly do it again ...but we would know, that it is not a simple promenade.","Written September 3, 2018"

France,Gorges de la Restonica,Terrifying road!,"Call me a wimp, but the drive up the Restonica valley road terrified me - single track, sheer drops with no barriers in places, and lots of traffic going both ways. The views are stunning, but for me it was far more relaxing walking up the Tavignano gorge. This walk starts from Corte and is parallel to the Restonica valley. There is no road; just a footpath. It's not too difficult but it is very beautiful. Just right for wimps!","Written September 17, 2017"
France,Gorges de la Restonica,Great swimming and beautiful landscape,"I would prefer to call this a vall√©e (valley) instead of a gorge (canyon) because it is not narrow and quite wide. The landscape is beautiful and it smells of pine trees (the real deal, not air refresher you see in taxis). The river has many spots with small pools that are excellent for swimming. The water is cold, but in summer that it is great because otherwise it is quite hot. From the parking lot at the end of the road it is possible to hike to lake Melu. The path follows the river but is not very close to it. It takes about 1 hour to the lake. The path is only about 2 kms, but you have to rise about 500 meters. Most of it is not very steep with lots of rocks, but at the end it is so steep there are some iron stairs and chains. The path is moderately difficult but you can do it with regular shoes. The path is very clearly marked with yellow paint. There are places to buy food and drink at the parking lot and about halfway. At the lake there is a source with drinking water, so carrying a lot of water is not necessary.
The road from Corte to the parking lot takes about half an hour and is very narrow and windy. Cars can only pass at passing zones. If you're not comfortable driving there is a shuttle service from Corte.
If you just want to swim and not hike to the lake, there are plenty of suitable spots that are just as beautiful as further ahead where you can park for free and drive less of the narrow road.
If you do park at the end, the fee is 6 euros and you will be directed to an available spot that is the closest to the trailhead at the end of the road. When we arrived at 11:30am in August this meant parking about 500 meters from the trailhead, and as the road is quite steep 100 meters below as well.","Written August 29, 2017"
France,Gorges de la Restonica,"Wonderful, but be prepared for some serious climbing","Well not climbing per se, but seriously large boulder hopping. Most of the walk up to the lakes is walking over and through boulders between 50cm and 1m in size. And it's all uphill, some parts easy, some parts really steep. There are a few chains along the way to help you get over these parts. There is nothing sheer, all just walking / climbing. But it does take a long time as you have to check your footprints all the time to make sure you don't step on a boulder sideways and twist your ankle, especially coming down. Oh and it's 550m vertical right to the top lake. At almost 2000m at the top, breathing is not all that easy. But really worth the climb. Took me 5 hours in total. There is a restaurant 20 mins after the start. But don't be tempted with a beer coming down... there is still 20 mins to go, and those boulders...",
France,Gorges de la Restonica,Beautiful,"Drive up slowly using the passing places as the road is single track for a lot of the route up. Pay ‚Ç¨6 and park where you are told, this stops the road getting clogged up at the top!

We walked up the hill and found a beautiful rock pool and waterfalls to swim and take photos in.

You don't need to go to the top and pay ‚Ç¨6, The route up the valley is 10+km long, you can park in lots of places along this road and get in the water to cool off.",

France,Gorges de la Restonica,Beautiful but nightmare of a drive!,"I had seen reviews saying the drive killed the enjoyment of the gorges and I have to agree. We did 3 different river swimming in Corsica and the drive was so nerve-wrecking compared to the other 2 that I don't think it's worth it. The Fango Valley is much more enjoyable. Ok in Restonica you have bigger mountains and all, but for me holidays are for relaxation and this wasn't.

Take your time to get a few kilometers through the valley first as awesome places could be found any few meters and the first opportunity might be nice but not the best.",
France,Gorges de la Restonica,Beautiful but the road is not for everyone!,"We arrived at our hotel (la Refuge de la Restonica), dropped our bags and started driving to the end of the Gorges de la Restonica and a hiking trip to a small lake.
Well, the road leading there was the toughest we encountered in Corsica! Very narrow (we had to make frequent stops and back ups to let a car driving from an opposite direction pass, or they did, if we were too advanced), winding along the mountains,
with huge drops (no rails). We were both exhausted by the time we arrived at the end of the road only to find unbelievable scenery. Rugged, beautiful mountain tops surrounded the gorge which at that point was very narrow. Off we went to hike.
- the trail was very steep and not taken care of, stones were loose and slippery. Then it started to drizzle and we decided to turn around and go back. It was getting late and we were afraid to go down the trail and slip. Oh, well, we felt so lucky to make it that far - trip was so worth it!!!","Written October 12, 2016"

France,Gorges de la Restonica,Not a stroll in the park,"Having visited the tourist information in Cort√© and obtained a map and directions, with the advice that trainers were OK to Lac Melo, but more serious footwear was essential for Lac Capitello, we were glad we chose to wear our walking boots even though we did not make it to the second lake.
The approach by car is up a narrow road for 10 miles at the end of which there is a car park cost 6‚Ç¨. Go early morning to make it easier to be in the direction of the majority of traffic as passing places are limited. It also means your exit will be easier.
The track beyond the car park is stoney and walking poles are a benefit, although we did see many with inappropriate footwear and numerous babies in child carriers as well as toddlers. The time estimate of 1 hour to Lac Melo may just be doable if you are in peak fitness and encounter no-one else en route. In many places the track is only wide enough for a single person.
Be prepared for a temperature change even if it is really hot when you set off. Mist and cloud can appear quickly removing the warmth of the sun. Be sure to take water although there are refreshments both above the car park and part way up.
The final approach does involve some scrambling across rocks assisted by chains, followed by the ascent of two sets of vertical, fixed, metal ladders.
The views across the lake and back down the valley do make the effort worthwhile. We did not proceed to the next lake, allegedly another 45 minutes over more challenging terrain.
Our return was back the way we had come although I think it is possible to follow a trail to the left leading back down the other side of the valley.

France,Gorges de la Restonica,great hike ... be prepared,"Beautiful scenery. This is not a smooth path but a mixture of medium sized granite boulders and loose gravel which can be challenging underfoot. There are areas of scramble. Being cautious on this rocky terrain, it took us substantially longer than most other hikers: about 6 hours roundtrip without stops to the second lake (Lac de Capitellu), whereas others suggest 4 hours. Ascending to the first lake (Lac de Melu), there is an option of going left or right at an intersection located just after a refuge and marked by a large cairn. Most of the traffic goes right, which is shorter but steeper and ends with two chain sections and two ladders. Going left is longer but more gradual and avoids the challenges of the chains and ladders, and is also a bit more shaded. The ascent to Lac de Capitellu is definitely more challenging, steep with three areas of scramble and two chain sections. Obviously appropriate footwear, sun protection, and plenty of water are essential. Having read other reviews about the narrow drive up, we found it to be straightforward. Perhaps by arriving fairly early and leaving late, we avoided the worst traffic. Driving in Ajaccio traffic with a constant stream of motorcycles weaving in every direction was far more stressful.","Written June 26, 2015"

There we ate our sandwiches and tried to continue to Lac di Capitelu (1930 m). But there was still a lot of snow, so after about a half of hour we returned back to Lac de Melu and enjoyed some ours of quietness and nature. There were already coming more and more hikers, so we decided to return slowly to our car. When we came down the large parking was full and even more.

France,Gorges de la Restonica,Road to the car park and walk to lake Melu near Corte,"The road to the car park for the walk to lake Melu is not just challenging it is the scariest drive I have done on Corsica .... and there are many difficult roads in Corsica - we were stopped on a B road because a car had gone over the edge and the gendarmerie were controlling the traffic while the forensic team gathered evidence. This road is worse than a B road... it is 9km of single track road up the mountain with no barrier, lots of hairpin bends. There are very very few places that two cars can squeeze past each other, so you have to pray you do not meet another car coming in the opposite direction.
The walk from the car park to the lake is lovely but the last half of the walk is climbing up rocks on a very steep incline. The yellow route markers are fairly frequent but you still need to pay attention because rock falls have changed the route or you miss a marker and end up having to clamber down large rocks to get back on the recommended route. The sign says it is a 1 hour walk, which is probably correct for the seasoned walker. We (5 healthy adults age 20 - 50) took 1 hour 20 mins at a reasonable pace

I only regret that we didn't see any wild animals, apart from a few hungry crows... Seems that they aren't any there.
If you're looking for a place to stay in Corte, I recommend the Hotel du Nord, best breakfast in Corsica!",
France,Gorges de la Restonica,Very beautiful,"Really splendid. The river goes through a narrow valley, and creates (thanks to the big rocks) a log set of natural pools of crystal clear water. Very nice to swim in summer. My advice: go to the end of the valley and take the hike up to the 2 lakes. It is only one hr each way (to the first lake) plus (in case) an additional 45 mins each way to the 2nd lake. Great views. Great walk.","Written August 27, 2012"
France,Gorges de la Restonica,hard but worth it,"OK. So if you want to climb you need to drive thru the gorge quite a ways to the car park. (You can also stop along the way and swim-another activity, and it looked beautiful and idyllic. We wanted to hike, and it was a hard climb (we are in our 50's and active gym goers here). Very rocky and at points you need to hang onto chains to get across certain points. Still it was wonderful when you finally arrive at the lake. We were there on a Sunday in July and it was VERY busy. I would suggest a weekday if possible. Take a backpack, lunch and enjoy your achievement...","Written August 24, 2012"

The number 2 bus takes you to cap d'antibes! There is useful info at the bus station and you can also walk to the tourism office, 5 mins from the station. Be sure to pick up a bus schedule for times to retun. Take the bus to FONTAINE. Approx 10min ride. Once there follow the signs for plage de garoupe. You can follow the parking lot to the start of the trail or hang out at the beach. The trail is well paved with safety railings along the way. Easy walk with a few stairways and areas that are rocky without a path. Well worth it as the views are incredible. One of the most beautiful hikes I have experienced.

Maybe it's busier in high season, but in January we easily found a space and there were lots free. The walk started just 2 minutes from the parking and was signposted at the beginning with a map and details of how long it would take to reach certain points. The views throughout the walk are incredible. Water crashing against the rocks on 1 side and glimpses of landscaped gardens of the villas beyond the high walls on the other. The path is easy to follow and easy to walk for the most part. It's not suitable for strollers or wheelchairs, but easy enough in trainers or walking boots. There's a 10 minute section just before the villa eilenroc which is a little harder to traverse- over small rocks- but no climbing of boulders! We took the road up via the villa eilenroc and decided to do the circuit rather than return the same way. I was glad we did, as it was really easy to follow (we took a photo of the map to make sure we didn't go wrong) and it led us past some beautiful villas and more olive trees. We're not very fit, so took plenty of stops and 100s of photos! There are places where you can go down closer to the sea too and sit for a few minutes soaking up the beauty around you.

Once begun there are very few opportunities to leave the path although there are plenty of resting points where you can sit and look out over the water or around the bay. The area around chez Abramovich is interesting! Here the whole path has been renewed - maybe because he wanted a landing jetty for his yacht which was subsequently denied and the whole experience feels like passing a maximum security prison rather than a home as cameras train on you all the way around.

Alighting at stop Fontaine, opposite you have a choice of taking the trail starting from the gardens at Villa Eilenroc on the right or from Plage Keller to the left. We started from the Plage Keller end.There's a Petit Casino shop where you can grab water and snacks. Advisable as there are no other shops nearby, unless you eat/drink at Plage de la Garoupe or Plage Keller. Walk down Bld de la Garoupe, turn right at Chemin de la Garoupe which takes you to the beaches, 10-15 mins depending how fast you walk in the heat. Cross along the beach to the opposite side where the start of the walking trail is sign posted. There are a couple of wider spaces at the start where you can have a picnic, but not much shade. As other reviewers have said, the path is marked and there is a wire rail to hold on to as you go. There are moments where the path only allows for single file and some steep steps (felt sorry for the toddler we passed who wanted to be carried and the steps were as high as her legs). Definitely recommend wearing trainers / sturdy shoes especially for the very rocky areas of the path, and a hat as not much shade. Check the bus timetable back to Antibes before your walk. They're not the most reliable and we waited over an hour in the heat and there's only a little bench in the sun. If you're there in the summer, I'd definitely recommend this walk and doing it the morning if you can.","Written September 15, 2018"

France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes",Walk of the Cap,"The Sentier du Littoral is a sea walk path around one of the most scenic places on earth, Cap d‚ÄôAntibes. You can find out more about it and how to find it by googling the walk. It is not marked well so get your directions in advance.
My experience was fabulous. As a fit senior, I found it quite walkable in sensible shoes, with a hat (boy do you need a hat) and a couple of hours. There are three legs to the journey and I found I could only to the first two comfortably - well, tuckered out. -but doable. You cover fascinating rock formations on both dirt and rock pathways in an undulating pattern around the edge of the Mediterranean. I did take so many pics of the rocks, of the yachts moored out and the blue blue sea that I was gone well over the 2 hours suggested at the outset on the sign. It would have been nice to have a few more benches and information plaques along the way. Ideally, there would have been a gin and tonic at the end of each leg of the walk. C‚Äôest dommage.",
France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes",The most beautiful 2 Hours Walk of my life,"We actually found this by accident, but I'm so glad that we did. If you take the entire walk it can be two hours. Start the walk from Plage de la Garoupe where the path begins.The entire walk was on a rock/concrete pathway that winds up and down and around the rocky coastline.

France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes",Tricky walk,"Having wanted to do this walk for several years, I finally had the opportunity recently. The weather was warm and sunny. I took the number 2 bus to the Fontaine stop and walked down the Plage Garoupe and then onto the coastal path, however I think doing it the other way around may be better as you can get a drink or something to eat at the end from the beachside restaurant, walking back to the bus stop as there is only 1 bus an hour.

The first part of the walk from Plage Garoupe was pleasant, but once I passed Cap Gros, it became windy and where the path was close to sea, there was alot of spray and waves crashing onto the rocks.

Some of the walk has nice paths, other bits are just dirt/stoney tracks or even pebbly beach, there are many sets of steps/stairs, some with hand rails some without, several stretches are along a cliff edge with railing and these sections I found quite scary. You definitely need a sturdy pair for shoes/boots and plenty of water, there are very few seat/benches where you can test and enjoy the view.

Yes there are some nice views across to Nice and towards the Esterel hills and some pretty bays, but personally I prefer the coastal walk around the Cap Ferret, yes its longer but its less scary and prettier.",

It is not a difficult hike, but the path has many steps up and down so it is advised to wear good walking shoes. It is a very popular part of the Sentier du Littoral, so you will encounter a lot of tourists even in low season. I wanted to visited the villa Eilenroc at the end (or beginning) of the path.

Close to this stop there is a few grocery shops, stock up on water and food if needed. Walk down Bd.la Garoupe and after 5-10 minutes you'll reach Garoupe beach and the start of the trail.

France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes",Nearly a James Bond moment,"A very pleasant coastal walk in the vicinity of some very private properties, with some having access to the water through structures reminiscent of a Bond film. The path is largely well defined with some parts on the stony beach margin, so delicate footwear is not appropriate. There are multiple steps, some quite steep. It is well worth the effort. We have walked it in sunshine and also when the sea was agitated, which produces some impressive wave impacts and plumes of spray in the small steep rocky inlets. Our most recent walk was on a grey day, but it was still a good experience. Cap d'Antibes can be reached by bus, with a stop fairly close to the start of the walk. You may need to check a map as I do not recollect any signposting to the start of the walk from the bus stop.

It is beautiful at sunset especially the part close to Anse de l'Argent Faux. You can walk it all from Plage de la Garoupe to Anse de l'Argent Faux. Or viceversa. Beautiful all year around but watch out when stormy weather. It may even be closed when waves are strong. Plan at least 2 to 3 hours so you can indulge at beautiful views or enjoy the stress relieving atmosphere. Flip flops may not really be the proper shoes. Better a pair of sneakers. During summer adventurous swimmer can swim in several spots but the easier spots are Baie des Miliardaires and Plage del'Argent Faux. You can park along Boulevard Francis Meilland and walk down Avenue Mrs Beaumont. When you reach the gate of Villa Eilenroc do not enter it but take the small path on the right otherwise you'll miss the first part.

I began ,near plague la garoupe which is the easy part. Beautiful views of the rocks below. About 3/4 of the way you reach the part is just a field of rocks with no directions how to go, just make your way across it the best you can. I am sure the younger people walking ahead of me made it much quicker. I took my time and was very careful. It was one of the hardest walks I ever did but was proud when I finished.

France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes",Lovely hike,"Admittedly we didn't do as much planning as we should have before deciding to take a short day trip from Cannes to Antibes and hike the Le Sentier Du Littoral coast trail.

We took the train from Cannes - just 7 minutes and 3 stops and a mere 8 euro roundtrip. Once in Antibes we walked 10 minutes to the beach and from there decided to take an Uber to what we thought would be the beginning of the trail. It wasn't well marked, so our Uber driver dropped us at the lovely Eden Roc hotel where we learned we had to walk another 1/2 mile to the trail head. Fortunately I would describe this area as the Beverly Hills of the French Riviera and the walk toward trailhead (Avenue Beaumont) was flanked by lovely gated country estates.

Entering at end of Beaumont Avenue, you descend ""stairs"" the trail which hugs the coastline. The entire hike could take about 2 hours, but our time was limited so we just hiked 1/2 mile out and another 1/2 mile back to our starting point. There are several small beaches along the way, divas others have mentioned, it would be ideal to pack a lunch and swimsuit. (Although there are no restrooms or changing areas, the small beach coves had natural alcoves that would allow some privacy for clothes changing.)

About the trail... it is very rough and rocky with many sets of steep stairs.
It is by no means a walk for someone with balance or mobility issues.

At the end of our short version of the hike we walked over to Plage Keller for lunch (about 1/3 mile from trail head on surface streets) where we had a lovely lunch. We ended up Ubering back to Cannes for about $30 to save time and in the end wish we had just Ubered both ways.",

France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes","Under some conditions, you can turn this Mediterranean trail in a walk along a dark Scottish ""firth""","The impression one gets from natural sites visited not only depends on the weather conditions, but also on the visit's time.
The case of our walk around Cap d'Antibes is significant. We walked the trail on a sunny day, so pleasant; but being late afternoon, the light was one - a bit dramatic, especially in winter - of the setting sun.
This fact, combined with the reading of some signs, warning on the high danger of walking there in case of storm surges (the waves could wipe out the walkers), and the sea actually a bit rough, have meant that we lived this journey as if we should walk, instead of on the placid Mediterranean, along any Scottish firth. Especially since in some points of the cliff the path was provided not only by railing, but even by a net high as a man, to prevent passers-by are drawn into the sea.
Given the beautiful day, however, the path was totally secure. But the same risk imagination made him creepy (the charm of the snake...). And this is the main character of the trail that ultimately - and pleasantly - remained in my mind.",
France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes",A spectacular and easy coastal walk,"We do this walk every time we come to the Cote d'Azur.

It is so close to the sea that in some spots, you could get wet from the sea sprays and/or have to tiptoe around around pools of sea water.
Some practical details: the walk starts and ends at the Plage de la Garoupe where there is plenty parking. But this walk is very popular with the locals so on weekends and holidays get there early in the day. You get back to the Plage de la Garoupe via city streets by making a series of right turns.
Lastly when the sea is rough, the trail is closed for safety reasons. There is an actual steel gate that you cannot get around.","Written January 26, 2016"

France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes",Hike Across Rocky Beaches,"Coastal path of Cap d'Antibes begins near Villa Eilenroc, goes all around the Antibes cap and ends at Plage de la Garoupe. It's about 6 km long and may take around 1.5 hours to complete. Compared to other coastal paths of the Riviera this one is sparsely marked (therefore 4 stars) and in some places you need to take a little bit of a guess where to go next. About half of the path snakes across stone beaches so wear sturdy shoes especially as some stones can be wet and slippery as the waves are close sometimes. There is also quite some stair climbing involved so be prepared.

The views are great but not out of the ordinary for the Riviera. Allow yourself enough time to complete the walk before dark as it can be dangerous (a lot of stones, slippery) after the sunset. Sunset (and, I imagine, sunrise) look awesome there. Overall, a bit tough but great hike, well worth the time.",

It's a large rocky promentary with a cliff path that snakes around the cliffs and up and down to the little inlets and rocky beaches. Here you'll find small groups sunbathing and swimming and boats moored just offshore. Its beautiful but quite a bit of a hard work - it needs a good pair of legs.

France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes",Beautiful views and unique access,"We started at Villa Eilen Roc after parking, a challenge in itself. There is only street parking, and the narrow streets become only wide enough for a single car, so everyone was backing long distances when they met an oncoming car.

Once we were walking though, all that was forgotten. The views are beautiful and there is a varied coastal terrain. Many people brought picnics and a swimsuit and lounged in a cove. We didn't know to do that, but we did walk all the way to Cap Gros, about 3 km. A great walk on one of the most beautiful coasts in France, but quite hot in August. We should have brought more water or started very early.

If you like to hike and can handle some variation in terrain (sometimes the trail was just a path in the rocks, other times dirt through a forest, steep steps, then a long path beautifully paved) there is probably no better way to see the Antibes coast.",

The no.2 Envibus does not depart from the Gate Tourists in the centre of town; try Place Charles de Gaulle. One euro gets you to the Fontaine stop where you can decide on whether you walk the trail clockwise or anticlockwise.
Doing it in a clockwise direction, you go down bd de la Garoupe (buy your water supplies in the Casino shop at the top of the road) turning right at the bottom of the hill, taking you Plage de la Garoupe, at the far end of which is the narrow entrance to the start of the sentier.
Walking time along the sea shore section will take about an hour; the trail splits, giving you two options, both of which bring you to the gates of Villa Eilenroc and Av Mrs Beaumont which brings you right back to the Fontaine bus stop.
Practicalities: decent footwear advisable although the terrain is never challenging. As your walk is likely to be framed around the Envibus no2 schedule, if you are likely to be waiting a half an hour for the return bus, time things so you delay on the coastal section rather than spend your time at the bus stop.

France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes",One of the great coastal walks,"Others may have a different view but there is really only one way to approach this walk. Start at the Villa Eilenroc and conclude at the Garoupe Beach. It means that you start with the experience of an almost deserted beach and the views of the rocky coastline with magnificent villas and their large mature gardens. Walking around the Villa Eilenroc is itself a highlight as is the steep descent into its own grotto with access to the sea. From there, the walk passes through areas that are densely shaded all the while with the sea on your right never far from sight and the sound of crashing waves and views of super yachts cruising past or small boats crashing through the waves. At various places, there are monumental structures overlooking the water where a pause from the walk is restorative and bucolic. The sight of Villa de la Cr√∂e and other large estates with their high stone walls and elaborate security cameras leaves little doubt that passers-by will not be invited in for tea. The walk meanders in and out of coves, up and down steep cliff faces and around and between further coastal shrubs and trees and open rocky sections. For most of the way, no other land is visible. At one point, in an instant, this all changes with faraway Bordighera the first place to be seen, then Cap Ferrat, then Nice and finally Cap d'Antibes itself. At this time of year, the Alpes Maritimes are covered in snow and the contrasting colours of aqua blue water, green spring growth, the clear sky and white tipped peaks are mesmerizing. The walk ends with the Plage de la Garoupe which offers excellent meals, coffees and ice-cream. Along the way, there are paths to the water and places to sit. It is well worth lingering but, at a pace, the whole trip back to where you start will take just a bit more than an hour.

The weather was perfect-hot, sunny, not a cloud in the sky, and the scenery was all the better for it. From the snow covered mountain peaks far in the distance, to the crystal clear rock pools this is truly a stunning walk. It has been carefully laid out to make access suitable for most people . Unfortunately, the very elderly or those with mobility challenges would not be able to follow it due to the various steep, stepped inclines and occasional stretch of large, loose boulders. We were pleasantly surprised by the lack of litter, and the path is very well-maintained. Make sure to take water and sun screen with you because there is little natural shade.

Some estates look like guarded fortresses, all fences totally private. Our concierge told us that many billionaires from Russia reside there.

From my car, to start the hike, I faced the water and walked right along it, as directed in the earlier review.

I ended up carrying my small dog part of the way as it got quite rocky, and uneven.

Also, it is not for those who fear heights and also not for stormy weather as there is a sign warning that the water/waves can cross the path at points in bad weather.

I could see the water had crossed the path at least in one place. It was a little slippery there.

There were wires as a fence and there were narrow steep and uneven steps at one point.

That said, I had on trail jogging shoes and was fine.

I definitely recommend it as it was a beautiful walk on a cold early morning.

France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes",Amazing walk with stunning views,"This walk is truly magnificent and not to be missed. We went with our 7 year old and 10 year old and they also loved it. It is not difficult at all but shoes are better than flip flops. Do take water as it can get pretty hot. There are plenty of spots to have a swim but we waited until the end and had a swim back where we parked the car. I have copied below FamilyGuy4Fun (Oslo) tips which were spot on if you have a car.

Practical tips: park in avenue Andr√© Sella, walk down towards Plage Keller and walk to the right, after 150 meters you will find the signs noting the start of the walk.. The times noted on the sign are not ambitious, we used 1hr 20m on what was marked as 1hr 50m. Wear shoes, not flipflops.

When heading back: take a right just before the Christies realtor for Avenue Gandolphe and you will walk right to your car. Do take a swim on the trip or on the public beach to the left of Plage Keller. If budget is no issue, check in on Plage Keller for a sunbed, full beach club service and a great lunch at Restaurant Ceasar.","Written September 12, 2014"
France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes",Check the bus times before you leave!,"A truly stunning walk, rocky with a bit of up and down, but anyone can do it and it's well worth the effort. Lovely views of the water, coves to swim in, gorgeous rocky seascapes. Just beautiful.
Thanks to TA advice we got off at Fontaine, walked down the Av JFK, then Mrs. Beaumont. The trail head is at the end of that path and from there you just follow the coastal path eastward. At the end you emerge at a beach, where we asked for directions back to the bus stop (in the same place we got off at, about 10-15 mins walk from the beach).

Important: If you decide to go in the late afternoon like we did, please check the bus timetable ahead of time! We arrived at about 5pm and returned to the stop at 7:40, only to find that the last bus had departed 20 mins prior. We had to ask the nearby hotel to call a taxi for us, which didn't arrive until 45 mins later and cost 20 euros to get back to Antibes. A bit of a downer to an otherwise great day.

Also, do bring water. Wear/ bring a swimsuit and a hat (the water was still warm in Sept, and the sun was beating down hard even in late afternoon).","Written September 9, 2014"
France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes",Marvelous unforgettable walk,"If you happen to be lucky enough you may find the Eilenroc Villa open. In that case, do not hesitate to visit it. Otherwise you can partly see the park and the villa from outside behind barriers when walking south on the ""Sentier du littoral"".
There is a public bus going from the beginning of the path to the center of Antibes. But do check and recheck the bus schedules and stops as in most regions in French, you can very hardly trust public transportation services...
An excellent day though quite exhausting day trip starts at beautiful Parc Exflora at the western outskirts of Antibes, before heading more east firstly along the beautiful sand beach, then in the center of Juan-les-Pins and finally along the sea side until the nice Botanical Garden already located on Cap d'Antibes. Visit the garden and then head via ""Sentier du calvaire"" to the red lightouse and nearby church on the top of the hill. Then, walk down, slowly reaching the main roads until you reach the beginning of the ""Sentier du littoral"". Walk almost 2 hours on the latter and try to find a bus to get to Antibes. Try to avoid the very disappointing ""Garoupe"" beach which is small and crowded... Plenty of stops can be made during the whole trip...","Written August 28, 2014"
France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes",Such a pain to find but totally worth it,"It took me three tries to finally find the trail head for this walk. Here are my tips:
- The Envibus system in Antibes is great. Each ride is only one Euro and the routes are very clear. Problems: it doesn't run all that often. Usually once every thirty minutes (forty on weekends) and you have to know where you're going. The #2 bus goes to Cap Eden Roc but I found the best way to get to the trail head was to get off at the FONTAINE bus stop. Basically if you SEE the sign for ""Plage de la Garoupe,"" Get off the bus. If you get all the way to Cap Eden Roc, stay on the bus and go back to Fontaine.
- At that point you have two options. You can walk down Avenue Mrs L.D. Beaumont or Bd de la Garoupe. Each way is less than a ten minute walk and which ever you don't chose, you'll do at the end. If you do the whole trail it becomes a circle and you come back to the Fontaine bus stop.
- If you go down Bd de la Garoupe (like I did) you have to go right to the end of the beach past the restaurant called ""Plage Joseph."" The beginning of the trail is there.
- Once you're on the trail, just keep going. Sometimes it's hard to see where to go next but you'll figure it out. Do the whole thing if you can. It's spectacular.
- A lot of people stress the importance of good walking shoes. Well I don't know about you but all I brought to the south of France was sandals. Yes I slipped a few times but overall I don't think it was as bad as they make it out to be. I guess it helps to have strong ankles?
- Other thoughts: Earlier is better. There is shade along the trail but it's still mostly in the sun. There are beaches but none of them are really ""sandy."" Still you can definitely go swimming. Lastly, no toilets. There were public toilets advertised just before Plage Joseph but I couldn't find them. Bring water but try and go with an empty bladder.
Enjoy! It's stunning and I'm so glad I was persistent and figured it out.",
France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes",Absolutely beautiful walk. Highly recommended.,"Myself and a friend did this walk in just over an hour, with stops in between. It is truly stunning, uninterrupted views of the coastline, beautiful vegetation and swimming spots along the way. We started at the Eden Roc end and made our way around to the public part of Plage Keller where we finished with a cooling swim. I would definitely recommend sturdy footwear as the path is quite rocky in places and bottles of water to keep yourself hydrated - we ran out halfway and were parched by the end.

Directions: take the number 2 bus rom the main bus station in Antibes, and get out at Fontaine on Cap d'Antibes. Follow the signs for the Eden Roc villa down Avenue Mrs. L.D. Beaumont and then Chemins des Douaniers all the way to the gates to the Eden Roc villa. The entrance to the trail is to the right of the villa and if you want a swim before you start, take the first right off the path down to a small swimming cove which is absolutely gorgeous. Rocky beach, but very private and secluded.","Written August 13, 2014"

France,"Le Sentier du Littoral, Cap d'Antibes","Great Day Outing from Nice, France","From Nice you can take a train or a bus to Antibes. Only 1 Eur for the bus ride from Nice.
From the Bus station in Antibes you take their number 2 bus. The last stop, from the bus station on this line is where you can pick up the trail. Sorry can't remember the stop name. But it is on the ""CAP"" as they call it.

An amazing walk on, over and under cliffs, around rocks and along the sea coast.

Most of the trail is concert and stone, but you need good walking shoes. Parts of the trail have a wire fence to keep you and the family from falling into the ocean some 50 feet below.

We had a great day. Take towels, bathing suits and water shoes. If you are a little adventurous you can find some areas were you can swim in the crystal clear water. The rocks are ""softer"" in the water because of the seaweed growth.

Well worth the time to go and see. Added some pictures to give you a sense of the place.",

France,Val d'Europe,Very Clean Super Shopping Centre Excellent Disabled Usage,"Had look in this place during our Disneyland Paris holiday and was well pleased with the enormous amount of shops from your Primark chavvy stuff to super designer outlets, I am in a wheelchair and require a carer and never had any problems with access to any shops, the disabled toilet areas are spacious and plentiful, and they are very clean, very helpful staff and good security throughout, the Auban hypermarket is like nothing I have ever seen.... amazing, lovely tasty food isles from all over the world, reasonable prices and lovely external market streets and a square if you wish to eat or shop outside, we will be back for more.","Written July 25, 2018"
France,Val d'Europe,Good shopping centre,"It's a great place to visit if you are in the area. Only one stop away from Marne Le Valle and cheaper to eat than at the resort area.

A good food and home shopping area in the middle of the centre that covers two floors which catered to our shopping needs","Written July 24, 2018"
France,Val d'Europe,free wifi and cover from the summer heat,"This is different than the name brand designer outlet that's about another 10-15 minute walk from the shopping mall but still all very accessible by public transit via the RER. My friend and I shopped until closing and had dinner, the return journey was PACKED TO THE BRIM on the platform - go in the other direction for one stop to Disney, cross the platform to return to Paris. At least that way you have a chance for a seat along with all your shopping goods.

Pros:
-free and actually stable wifi throughout the property
-free and clean bathrooms widely available within
-very roomy and high ceilings, bright and comfortable to shop in
-most stores had sales that can communicate in English
-almost something for everyone

Cons:
can't really think of any. browse the website for the store directory to make sure they have something you're looking for. again, this is different that la vallee village where all the luxury brands are (longchamp, tory burch, bonpoint, prada, gucci, etc) Food options are kind of limited (burgers, one asian restaurant, fro-yo, american bar food, sandwiches...not really option for healthy eating)

Price wise - came during the seasonal summer sale season so prices are definitely better than rural Paris. Stock is not the latest season but as long as you keep expectations in line, this is worth the approximate 1 hour trip from central Paris as you get to shop this and next door Vallee all in the same day. Kids clothing stores didn't disappoint either, defnitely better pricing here.","Written July 23, 2018"

The kickers shop had a great sale (nothing in my size I liked) food court is at the back and smells amazing! Too much to choose from, but there is something for everyone! We avoided the shops we had at home and only went to the ones we didn‚Äôt have. The tea shop is fab, so many different flavours!! Sample what you can! Definitely worth the train ride to here, the trains have 3 levels of seats! Would go back again if we ever visit Disneyland Paris.

We were also informed that we could purchase a book of 10 tickets for like ‚Ç¨1.50 per person which worked out pretty well for us as we were a group of 5 (ticket there & back).

From the station it is a small walk to the shopping centre but very easy to get to.
Loved the extra security - all bags were checked before entering & it was huge. VERY VERY BUSY but plenty of places to eat inside & outside.

France,Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre,Excellent exhibition in great mansion,"We visited the Tannenheim exhibition on loan from the Guggenheim museum. We were much impressed, both by the quality and variety of paintings as well as the mansion itself and the beautifully maintained garden. We had to search a bit to find it but what an oasis in the middle of the city centre. The entrance fee of 14 euro is somewhat expensive but worth it. The garden cafe looked very attractive and is probably also worth a more in depth view ;-).",
France,Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre,Lovely rooms and very pretty cafe,The visit to this mansion - which was never a hotel - begins with a short interesting instructive film about the life of Paul Cezanne and continues through a bedroom and music room inhabited by Pauline Caumont who lived in the house for 54 years until her death in 1850.

France,Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre,Beautifully renovated and furnished 18 century building. The masterpieces from the Guggenheim exhibition was superb.,"This hotel, that was built in the first part of the 18th century, has had several different uses over the years but was extensively refurbished and reopened to the public in 2015 as a cultural and art centre that hosts temporary exhibitions.

The current exhibition that we had the pleasure to see was ""Masterpieces from the Guggenheim Foundation. From Manet to Picasso, the Thannhauser Collection"" which was absolutely superb with multiple paintings by Cezanne, Seurat, Renoir, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Braque and of course Picasso amongst others.

Entry to the ""Hotel de Caumont was EUR 14-00 per person and included a self-guided visit to the first floor rooms that had been beautifully restored with magnificent period furnishings as well as the Guggenheim Collection paintings, the lovely gardens at the rear of the house and a film on Cezanne's life. There was a large gift shop on the ground floor if that is what you are into.

Don't miss the film about Cezanne that is held upstairs in a theatre above the entrance to the complex where you pass through security which is a separate building to the main house. The film runs for about 20 minutes, has sub-titles in English, and was fairly good. Hold onto your entry ticket as you will need this to access the gates into the theatre. We watched it on the way out.

There is also a cafe with seating in the gardens. We normally avoid these places as the food can be ordinary and on the expensive side. Not so on this occasion and it was exceptionally pleasant sitting outside in the gardens.",

After the two hours or so it takes to visit the museum, sashay to the manicured garden and sculptured fountains. By then, you will be ready for a culinary art experience to be had at the Cafe Caumont off the garden or at its al fresco in the garden. The salads are named for famous operas; Othello or Carmen or maybe La Boheme? Daily surprising specials. Wines and Champagnes? Just ask. The dining rooms are historically decorated for a perfect immersion into the 18th century France. A morning at the museum and lunch in the garden. That's life in Provence.",

France,Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre,The Guggenheim Collection was superb.,"We began the day knowing exactly what we wanted to do: Visit the mus√©e at the H√¥tel de Caumont where 50 pieces from the New York Guggenheim Museum were installed to celebrate the collection of modern art by Justin Thannhauser and his father from Manet to Picasso. The Jewish family, originally from Munich, then Berlin, then Amsterdam and finally New York, surviving the Holocaust, had collected the art over a period of almost 100 years. Solomon Guggenheim purchased the collection from Justin Thannhauser who did not have any surviving children.

The 50 pieces are a broad and excellent representation of the progress of modern art from the impressionist work of Monet and Cezanne through the cubism of Picasso to the representational work of Matisse and other moderns.
We were particularly taken by a gift from Picasso to Justin Thannhauser about 1960 when he married again after his first wife died, a picture of a black cat and a blue lobster, supposed to represent Thannhauser, and his new wife Hilde.

The museum is the Quartier Mazarin where Cardinal Mazarin summered, installed in a magnificent 18th century mansion now restored.","Written August 5, 2019"

When we visited last month, there was an exposition of the painter Nicolas de Sta√´l. Like many artists his work is subjective and perhaps not to everyone's liking, but the wife and I found some of the pieces excellent.

The formal garden, although quite small, is lovely. Adjoining that is a fantastic restaurant, although it can be very busy (and expensive).

One of Aix's main cultural attraction.",

France,Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre,Impressive art but facilities and restaurant staff improvement measures need to be taken,"We enjoyed the exhibitions throughout our visit here. The art is impressive and outstanding. Though, the services and facilities can still be improved. Visiting in days when the outside temperature is well above 35 degrees, there are no facilities inside to buy cold water. Moreover, after ending our visit, we wanted to have some drinks and desserts outside on the terrace. A very rude member of the staff told us we can not have that, only lunch being allowed and it was around 3 PM already. This was like a ''kind invitation'' to leave. I find this completely disrespectful and rude, given that all visitors pay to visit the art centre and even if you want to have some drinks and desserts on the terrace, they are not for free. I was completely disappointed by this situation just after a memorable exhibition, because I had completely other expectations at this level.","Written August 19, 2018"

On the first occasion we saw the Nicolas de Stael exhibition. I have read mixed reviews on Trip Advisor and all I can say is that we thought it was excellent, well laid out and with helpful advice - very good value for money. We finished with a coffee on the terrace - a haven of tranquility with lovely views over the formal gardens
On the second occasion, we went to a Saturday evening jazz evening, which kicks off with a glass of champagne and then is followed by a couple of hours of summer evening jazz - perfect! Just a word of warning - food is not included, but can be ordered from the menu. Again, we thought this represented very good value for money
Both thoroughly recommended

He was a true impressionist and a beautiful paisagist. Highly recommended.",

The Center itself is a gloriously restored 18th-century hotel particulier--mansion, to most of us. It has a beautiful cafe with three rooms, decorated very differently, and a lovely small garden where there is also food service. The food is excellent, if pricey.

There are also a couple of rooms restored to the way they were back in the days of the Reauville family, which lived here in the 18th century-- a music room and a bedroom. They are well worth visiting. And there is a well-stocked gift shop with usual attractive items.","Written October 5, 2017"

Nevertheless, Sisley's work is beautifully displayed. We used audio-guides which complemented the visit nicely. Our only regret is that the coffee-shop should be so exclusive with exhorbitant prices and a selection that does not appeal to the average visiting familly or foreign tourist.

It was nice that the museum was something to be in awe of in addition to the exhibit (Sisley).","Written July 10, 2017"
France,Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre,Ratings may go up or down depending on the exhibition of the day.,"The Hotel de Caumont is, in a word, beautiful. Stately and elegant, restoration work on the building has been immaculate, with everything in sight done to the highest order. The interior rooms are as handsome as the exterior facade, from the entrance area to the Caumont's gift shop to its permanent rooms. I would add the extraordinary cafe to this, but I am saving that for a separate review. The exhibition galleries on the upper floors are more subdued so as not to take away from the artwork on current display.

The day I visited, works of Alfred Sisley were on display. Sisley, an impressionist painter, was British but spent most of his life in France, hanging with the likes of Monet and Renoir. If you favored the impressionists, you might have an appreciation for Sisley, but while I don't claim to be an expert, there are probably reasons that your average museum-goer would be much more familiar with Sisley's contemporaries. It was interesting, but I probably would look forward to the next exhibition once this has had its run through Oct 15.

The permanent rooms are wonderful, depicting life as it might have been for you in the 18th century, if you happened to have a load of cash in your pockets. The music room and the lady's boudoir are a bit over the top-decor wise (Chip and Joanna Gaines would likely not approve) but they do give you a snapshot of the good life back then. The Caumont's shop is divided into two large rooms with impressive ceiling heights and period decor. There are things on sale to suit every taste but even if you bought nothing here, just walking through the rooms would be a satisfying experience. Here's something else that you might want to consider. When you are through with your visit to the upstairs area galleries, go to the top of the spiral staircase in the middle of the mansion and take a photo looking down from the top. For lovers of architecture, this is not to be missed.

As I noted, the Cafe deserves its own separate review, so I will do that. Anyone who visits Aix without taking in the Caumont would be missing one of its arguably best...perhaps THE best...attraction.","Written July 5, 2017"

France,Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre,Not Worth The Price,"I was surprised that this is the number one museum to visit in Aix en Provence. We love visiting historical homes that are furnished in the period. However, there were only two rooms to view in this gorgeously restored mansion. Although the two rooms (the lady of the house's music parlor and bedroom) were pretty enough, it was definitely not worth the price of 17 Euros for two plus another euro to store a backpack, which was required. To be fair, we were told by the receptionist that the exhibition rooms were closed during our visit but we had no idea how limited the rest of the house would be. The well-reviewed movie of Cezanne was entirely in French and lost on our group. Still, even if you can speak French, I don't think it would be worth the price of almost 20 Euros to view two rooms and watch a short film.

There is a beautiful and elegant cafe in the lower rooms, which was gorgeously decorated in the period style, but we did not take advantage of this. The prices, although somewhat high, seemed in line with many similar restaurants in Provence and you had the added benefit of sitting in the home's small but lovely courtyard garden.","Written May 31, 2017"

It's best to check to see what they are featuring for special exhibition before you go. Its always interesting to see the private homes of super wealthy aristocracy. If you only go to enjoy the tranquility of the lovely garden with a light meal in the tea room, you don't have to pay the entry fee. When we attended, there was a well curated exhibit about Marilyn Monroe (the rest of the world seems to be more fixated on the mystique of Marilyn than Americans!). There is an interesting 30 minute documentary about Paul Cezanne who was born and lived in Aix-en-Provence. The gift shop is unusual with good quality French chinaware, glassware and accessories other than the usual touristy souvenirs.","Written May 5, 2017"
France,Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre,"Museum, art gallery, garden and elegant restaurant all in one.","This beautiful old house bears testament to Aix's past, with its lovingly-restored rooms and formal gardens.
The short film about the life of Cezanne is engaging and informative, and the current exhibition of photographs of actress Marilyn Monroe well-presented.
Our glasses of champagne at the end of our visit were served with panache by the waiters.
To hear that the owners had sheltered members of the Resistance in the house's basement during WW2 was just another reason to enjoy having visited the Hotel de Caumont.",
France,Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre,Interesting little museum,"The Marilyn Monroe exhibit was quite interesting; however, I was disappointed at how few paintings by Paul Cezanne they had (I think I only saw one). After all, Paul Cezanne is a local hero. If you want to see his work, you have to go to the Granet Museum nearby. The cafe was nice, but pricy","Written April 26, 2017"

France,Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre,Don't go unless you really want to see the exhibit,"We visited to see the restored historical rooms. Not worth it. If there is an exhibit on you must pay the full price because ""the exhibit is in the rooms so you can't see the rooms without seeing the exhibit."" Not true! There were only two historical rooms and all the others (where there was the exhibit) were totally new on the inside. We were quite disappointed.

If the exhibit were on something interesting it would have been better but we didn't come all the way to France to see something about Marilyn Monroe... I would suggest the Hotel de Caumont allow people to visit just the historical rooms and garden for a lower price.","Written April 13, 2017"
France,Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre,"Beautifully restored, an oasis of peace","It almost doesn't matter what exhibition happens to be running because the building and the gardens are worth the visit in any case. Certainly, the exhibitions can be uneven - I saw a wonderful Canaletto show there but was disappointed with the recent Marylin Monroe exhibit - but the environment is so pleasant. There is a nice caf√© in the gardens and if the weather isn't too clement you can always try out the very luxurious tea room... at a price! Of course, you can't get out of the building without going through the shop, but that's no bad thing since there is a wealth of exhibit-related items and various souvenirs of all types. The quality of the renovation is really eye-popping and I would thoroughly recommend a visit if the exhibition at the time appeals to in any way.","Written April 11, 2017"

Perhaps the staff is over-worked, short-handed, or just plain worn out after a busy summer-- but they're grumpy and surly and this is a shame.
What is going on with their Ladies' Room? Is the (new) sink already very worn or just filthy? See attached photo.",
France,Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre,Fabulous venue,"We went to the recent Turner exhibition here, and were surprised by the lovely venue & gardens. They have done a superb renovation job and fashioned a gallery fit to show off the finest paintings.

France,Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre,Beautiful space for an art fix,"Yes, I saw the Turner Exhibition. And I thought it sublime. But then I appreciated that this was a narrative of Turner's development and style rather than a blockbuster show of ""Greatest Hits"". It gave me a much greater understanding about his approach, his acquisition of knowledge and application of theory. It was a wholly didactic approach that I found delightful. I purchased the iPhone app for a guide so that I could wear my own headphones, and that worked out very well indeed.
Naturally the space was crowded: it was during the festival. But I still found it possible to linger over my favorite works. There was a line to enter, but it was not unduly long, and the staff were professional and diligently processed everyone through.
The building itself is beautifully restored and truly proven√ßal. Take a moment to sit on one of the benches in the courtyard and admire the fa√ßade, relax and drink in the atmosphere.","Written September 11, 2016"

France,Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre,Newly restored gem,"Recently opened, after a major renovation,the Hotel de Caumont is a gem. There was an excellent, informative Turner exhibit, as well as an informative film about Cezanne's life. A surprise treat was a charming restaurant, both inside and in the garden under huge umbrellas. A wide range of salads and tarts, as well as more substantial meals. Good for tea as well.
We first tried to go in late afternoon and the line was around the block. We returned about 11AM and found a manageable line. Located just off Cour Mirabeau.
Even if one has little interest in paintings, this is worth visiting for the elegance of the building and gardens. An underground parking garage nearby.","Written August 31, 2016"
France,Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre,More English translation needed! Please!,"Our French is very rudimentary but when I learned that English audio guides were available we perked up a bit and went to see the exhibit (Turner) and learn about his work.

Upon arrival, we were quite deflated as all the signage/instruction was in French and no one was at the desk, just a security official screening guests. He asked if we had a ticket, we did not, so he waved us to the ticket line. There the attendant spoke some English, sold us the ticket w/English audio guide and we went in. We got to the appropriate floor of the exhibit, received our audioguides and instruction and entered.

Room after room, there was so much information (text) on the walls and it was all in French. Every placard was in French as well. An audio guide was available for only a fraction of all the works on exhibit.

I understand that there wouldn't be audio for every piece, but the lack of English translation throughout the exhibit was the most disappointing. We could have spent a half day there.

Beyond the language barriers, we arrived just after opening hours. The crowd was not too congested, but there was some jostling and some toes stepped upon on occasion.

The salons/rooms to view were the music room and the bedroom just before you enter the exhibit, and the rooms in the cafe. We did have a nice lunch in the cafe, but I thought that you had to eat there in order to see the rooms-it was all so very confusing . I would have liked to have taken photos of the rooms, but then it was filled with diners. We walked around and sat in the garden as well.

My takeaways are 1)had I known about the lack of English translation , I would have done more advance research on Turner and 2) that the purchase of the exhibit+salons+gardens will get you access to the cafe area since those rooms are part of the salons and I would take photos! As for the food, I could take it or leave it..it's a little pricy. You really are paying for the ambiance the venue provides.",

The presentation and layout of an exhibition are important to the experience, and the Caumont is not up to the task.

Obviously it is crowded with annoying tourists, that are there just to make a selfie of themselves inside.... Well, the church cannot help it (or shoul they perhaps forbid mobile phones inside?). The most amazing particularity of the church are the many statues that are hanging outside the church. Normally there are many statues of saints around the porch, but the Reims Cathedral also features many on the sides, up in the towers, behind. It is very intrueging to walk around it and look at them.","Written December 27, 2019"

This was understandable and no one in our group was asking him to speak English but he certainly made it clear he was not going to try to translate a word into English. I would recommended to go to the roof top to see the sites but do not be offended by a rude tour guide that does not like his job.","Written August 30, 2019"

France,Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Reims,Rooftop tour,"The Cathedral is a must see if visiting Reims. It is free in to visit the cathedral, the place of most of the French coronations. The roof visit was was ‚Ç¨8 per person. There were 18 people on our tour. It would have been a richer visit has it been in English, the tour is only available in French, and my school French is pretty basic.
This tour should be undertaken with caution if you are claustrophobic and afraid of heights! I am unfit was out of breath after going up the 249 tight spiral stairs. I am also uncomfortable with heights.
Was it worth it? Oh Yes, worth the pounding heart and the initial spinning head! The height and volume are astounding and when you think all built without machinery.
I would advise going early to book a place on this tour.
We also went to the amazing light show projected onto the front of the Cathedral This was twice nightly when we were there, also free! But again worth going early to secure a good viewing point.

We went with a champagne tour - it was our first stop before heading out of the city for tastings. I am not a church goer, but am an avid architecture fan and for this reason, I really enjoyed taking the time to see and hear more about it, as well as a stop inside. There are over 2300 statues that adorn this cathedral and the stained glass is almost as impressive. Even though it was a Sunday, visitors are allowed inside and may even join in the services, in a section in back, slightly separated from the usual patronage. However, because a service was going on, we were told that we could not take any photographs toward the front - only the rear. I felt it a little tacky to have a souvenir shop right there inside the main entrance, but it looks like they do very good business and assuming it helps the upkeep of the building, I can understand.

It cost 6 Euros and you get a tablet and a set off headphones. It actually covers more than just the cathedral so quite good value from that perspective. Whilst it was interesting to listen to the soundbites, it wasn't really clear when you should be standing when listening to each soundbyte - so I think that could be improved. However, it was interesting enough and we certainly learnt more than if we had just wandered around in the cathedral.","Written June 25, 2019"
France,Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Reims,Chagall,"Oh my goodness! What a beautiful cathedral this one is. No wonder it is the historical and customary coronation venue for the erstwhile French monarchs. It is just beautiful with the stained glass the crowning (good pun?) glory. Of particular note are the three (I think) modern windows by Marc Chagall done in the 1970's. They have the richness of colour of the ancient windows but absolutely reflect the aesthetic of the 70's.
It's glorious and if you get the chance, drink it in. It's free entry as with most churches, unless you want to choose add ons, of course.

Visiting this cathedral, also a Notre Dame, with its history both exalted (coronations of kings) and sad (fires, bombings), helped us to remember that many ancient buildings have been damaged but rebuilt. This is a magnificent structure and it was humbling to be in a place where so much history has taken place.

It is an easy 50 minute TGV train return trip at night. Now that Notre-Dame of Paris is closed, do consider coming here to Notre-Dame of Reims. All of the Kings of France were coronated here in the Middle Ages. This cathedral is an easy walk from the main pedestrian zone of Reims which is full of shops, restaurants, cafes and ice cream shops. Reims is very much worth the visit to de-stress and relax and take in the French life. You are on vacation right? The train ride is very enjoyable and you'll be glad you visited Reims.

The ceiling is high and vaulted with huge ornate supporting columns and the whole place is as fine a specimen of gothic architecture as you ever will see.
There are lots of information panels along the walls that detail the cathedrals founding and various reconstructions, especially the work done after extensive damage in the wars. They are mostly in French but some ate in English too.

It‚Äôs soars into the skies and has a strangely skeletal look as, above the massive entrance you can see through the two bells towers to ribs beyond.

Once inside, though chilly, it was peaceful, calm enveloping, mysterious (in a good way) and utterly beguiling. There was gentle organ music playing at a distance and, although there were many visitors, they were not s bustling distraction as can be the case in many similar venues.

It‚Äôs a very warm and welcoming place, rich in history, yet not over bearing. The stained glass, especially in the east end, is wonderful, not least the Chagall windows. And the mixture of ancient and modern works so effortlessly.

France,Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Reims,A Magnificent Structure,"This magnificent Cathedral is where French kings were crowned. Also known as Our Lady of Reims (French: Notre-Dame de Reims) is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Reims, France, built in the High Gothic style. The cathedral replaced an older church, destroyed by fire in 1211, that was built on the site of the basilica where Clovis I was baptized by Saint Remi, bishop of Reims in 496.

France,The Hall of Mirrors,Impressive,"The Hall of Mirrors is the jewel in the crown of the Palace of Versailles. It was meant to make a strong statement about the god-given power of the King, Louis XIV, who was responsible for the building of the Palace. The Hall of Mirrors is also famous for being the site where several important historical events have taken place, one of them being the Proclamation of the German Empire in 1871, after the German states had defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War, and another the signing of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I, in 1919.",
France,The Hall of Mirrors,A must to see in you life!,The Hall of Mirrors is a grand Baroque style gallery and one of the most emblematic rooms in the royal Palace of Versailles. The salons in the castle were intended to illustrate the power of the absolutist monarch Louis XIV. It worked! You can only imaged how powerful he must be on his time.,"Written August 31, 2020"
France,The Hall of Mirrors,A showroom that has become the site of two great events in world history.,"The mirror gallery was called the Great under Louis. This name is received only in the XIX century. This is the most striking part of Versailles, built from 1678 to 1684. In fact, the architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart made a terrace covered with a vault, turning 17 windows of the gallery into a Park. In front of each window, the attic installed mirrors. The visitor's view of the Park returns to the mirror, which reflects the Park and the sky, creating a game of infinite perspectives - real and imaginary-reflected. Marble between mirrors doesn`t allow you to focus on the boundaries of space, creating the illusion of disappearing walls. Unfortunately, only the Palace staff can fully enjoy it. At normal times, a dense line of tourists moves along the gallery. I've only seen something like this in the Vatican museums and in the Moscow and Tokyo metro during rush hours. Nevertheless, take a look at the once magnificent, but now darkened mirrors that were supposed to demonstrate their superiority over the founders of the genre-Venetian mirrors. Mirrors were made at the manufactory founded by Minister Colbert. Given that it is constantly crowded with foreign nobility, the Mirror gallery is actually a showroom of the French luxury goods industry, the baton of which is carried by Mr. Arnaud with his concern Louis Vuitton. Lift your head up and look at the magnificent plafonds by Charles Le Brun, dedicated to the real, but mostly imaginary merits of Louis XIV. The 73-meter gallery has witnessed many historical events, of which two are world-wide. January 8, 1871 William I was proclaimed German Emperor here. This marked the end of German unification, which was hindered by France, which had lost the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-1871. Here, on June 28, 1919, the Versailles peace Treaty was signed, returning Alsace and Lorraine to France, ending world war I, but creating, alas, the conditions for a more bloody world war II.",
France,The Hall of Mirrors,Very crowded but worth seeing,"This trip to Versailles was booked through a tour bus called Paris City Vision. They offer daily half-day trips for about 54 USD per person which includes your transportation and entrance ticket. Initially we did not think a half day would be sufficient but due to most of the gardens being closed for winter we found it was a reasonable amount of time. Versailles is very large with several corridors that focus on different areas of the history of the property. Upon entering and going through security you can receive an automated tour device that can tell you more about the exhibits you‚Äôre looking at by entering in the number displayed and listening on it like a cell phone. You can also bring headphones to attach to this, which we weren‚Äôt aware of, that would have made things easier to listen hands-free. Much like our experience at the Louvre we noticed that many people just wanted to go in and see the main areas to photograph so it seemed much less crowded and often times we found ourselves to be the only ones in a hallway or room. Obviously the most popular place here inside is the hall of mirrors so we suggest going there and waiting for it to clear out a bit if you want a good picture. Since many tour groups go through here you‚Äôll find there are waves of people going through so if you‚Äôre patient you can get a shot with not as many people in it. Overall, we found this to be enjoyable given the circumstances but definitely want to come back in the summer to take full advantage of the gardens!

I can't wait to go back.,"Written January 7, 2020"
France,The Hall of Mirrors,Highlight of Interior,This what you really want to see in the Palace of Versailles. The mirrors reflect the stunning Gardens outside the windows and the lighting and artwork is amazing.,
France,The Hall of Mirrors,Mirror mirror on the wall,Truly beautiful with mirrors and chandeliers! It‚Äôs really a big room that fits a lot of people in there!,
France,The Hall of Mirrors,"But seriously, folks...","If you‚Äôve seen photos and then were disappointed when you got there, stay home!
Things are what they are, not what you imagined they‚Äôd be.
Having said that, The Hall of Mirrors was yet another of those moments in our travels when we stood, silently, and thought ‚ÄúIf these walls could talk... and here we are.‚Äù
Historical perspective must take precedence over personal expectations. Otherwise you‚Äôd hear people standing on the Giza plateau saying things like ‚ÄúOriginally they were covered with marble and shone like the sun. This is disappointing.‚Äù",
France,The Hall of Mirrors,Underwhelmed,It looks great in the empty photos but the reality is it is always full and hard to see much. Much smaller than expected.,
France,The Hall of Mirrors,Underwhelming,"I visited Versailles in the off-season.
I didn't even notice the Hall of Mirrors the first time I went through. And that says a lot. I wanted to see this place ever since I planned my visit and even ran back inside to find it only to discover I have actually gone through it without noticing.

It is one of the better-looking and better-arranged zones in the palais, but is by no means as wonderful as many make it out to be. Or it's just not my cuppa tea, I guess.
The mirrors themselves are bland and don't shine much. Many are misproportioned and the reflections are blurred and wobbly.",
France,The Hall of Mirrors,"Such An Important Part Of History, Despite How Busy It Is, You Have To See It!","We came In November and although it was busy it was ok, TIP do the gardens, Trianons and The Hamlet first, we came in about 3pm by which time it was a lot quieter and the majority of the coach trippers had left. This is such an important part of history it‚Äôs sad to read some of the negative reviews, it is what it is, like everywhere in the world, it‚Äôs busy, people want to travel and see the world, but would not have missed it for the world. It was great to see a separate exhibition with all the photos of when the Treaty Of Versailles was signed, then to walk into The Hall of Mirrors it takes your breath away.","Written December 24, 2019"

However, the day we (wife and two young daughters) went it was busy so you could not appreciate the full experience of the room. If a quiet day then go to the palace and go to the room.","Written December 18, 2019"
France,The Hall of Mirrors,Look great in the picture,"As it shows in the picture here, the hall of mirrors look astonishing but in reality when you are there, it is not so. Perhaps in the real time of the ball or the parties, the hall functioned good.

France,The Hall of Mirrors,Worth the wait,"Another bucket list item checked off. The day we went was off and on light rain. We went early without tickets and did fine. There was a line, but it kept moving. It was not do crowded that we were not able to enjoy everything. We would try to get ahead of tour groups or stay behind them. Much histiry here and to think that it had 10,000 workers when occupied.
No large bags and you want to travel small. I cannot imagine what the lines are like in high season and on sunny days. The rooms would be crowded then also.

France,The Hall of Mirrors,Beautiful,It's really quite lively but very very busy. That aside its such an iconic space that you can see why everyone makes a bee line for it when visiting the palace,"Written October 22, 2019"
France,The Hall of Mirrors,"Opulence, Power and History Through Mirrors","Completed in 1684, the Palace of Versailles‚Äô Hall of Mirrors is, without question, the metaphorical center of this grand palace. King Louis XIV, and subsequent members of the royal family, made sure that all who visited the palace passed through these opulent marble and mirror-clad walls. The central message here was obviously clear: France is an economic, political, military and artistic success. Indeed, when you pass through this long and rather gaudy hallway, even today, who would argue otherwise?

As we entered the Hall of Mirrors, it was crowded, yes, but that did not detract from the overall experience of actually walking through and observing history. Even now, as I sit here and write this short review, it‚Äôs awe-inspiring to realize that I, too, walked through this magnificent hall where the German Empire was established in 1871 and the Treaty of Versailles was signed in June of 1919. The Hall of Mirrors and, indeed, the whole palace is rife with history.

While a walk through this hallway would‚Äôve been better without the large crowds, it wasn‚Äôt so crowded so as to mar the experience. I was still able to ‚Äúdrink it in‚Äù and see why this room has been recognized as the proverbial center of the Palace. I think more than anything else, the Hall of Mirrors highlights, in the most graphic way, the Sun King‚Äôs rather inflated sense of self: The 300+ mirrors represent economic prosperity and richness, but it is the vaulted ceiling that takes the cake. Here, there are a series of paintings by Le Brun highlighting the ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù in both political governance and management of the economy by King Louis XIV himself . . . how subtle! In the modern era, one might compare such lavishness to that of Trump ;)

In any event, no visit to the Palace of Versailles would be complete without a walkthrough of the Hall of Mirrors. Meant to act as a clear sign and signifier of the glory of France, the Hall of Mirrors accomplishes this ten times over. The crowds could be a bit much, but it‚Äôs worth it to walk through such rich history.",
France,The Hall of Mirrors,Highlight of the palace,This was the one place I wanted to see at the palace and it didn‚Äôt disappoint! Very beautiful room but difficult to take pictures during the day due to lots of people in there and tour groups. Would definitely like to come again right at opening or near closing!,

Versailles Palace opens at 9:00am and there was a relatively long line already waiting to enter when we arrived @ 8:45am. It's covered by the Paris Museum Pass.

Once inside the palace, it's pretty easy to navigate. Personally, I felt that Vaux le Vicomte was a better day trip from Paris and less crowded.

A water mirror sounded a little weird, but when we got there and experienced it, we loved it. The area across from Place de la Bourse, and next to the river Garonne, is quite huge. The water springs from holes in the granite ground and fills the whole area for a few minutes (only a couple of centimetres high). At times a very fine mist comes up. It is enjoyable when you want some relaxation time. And the views all around are fantastic as well.",

France,The Water Mirror,Meh - better in pictures,"I didn't do a lot of research on this one, but I was surprised that it wasn't a pool, it is a big open space with flat stone tiles, upon which jets spray water on a timer. Since it isn't a big pool, people walk all over it, so there is nearly always someone in the way of your view, and it ruins the ""mirror"" experience.

France,The Water Mirror,Reflections,The first time we saw this it was breezy which spoilt the effect. The next visit the reflections were good. Kids playing in the water half an inch deep and every 23 minutes there was a mist effect for a few minutes quite eerie.,"Written September 28, 2019"
France,The Water Mirror,Super cool!,"We saw this crowd from a distance and was compelled to see what was going on. The fountain was spraying low volumes of water on flat concrete and the kids were having a blast (adults too) running through the spray.

Then it stopped and when you position yourself against the sun, the water makes a giant reflecting pond of the historical Place de la Bource.

Awesome effect!",
France,The Water Mirror,Great place to use the camera!,"Reflecting the elegance of the surrounding architecture, perfect symmetry, in the surface of this cleverly positioned water mirror. Children and adults alike having fun on the mirror, dance routines, playing statues, the funniest thing was watching dogs enjoying the water and the mirror. Take the camera , be patient and some very funny moments will be captured.",

France,The Water Mirror,Water is across the street,"In reality this scene DOES NOT look the omnipresent gorgeous picture. There is a giant fountain in front, center to the square enclosed by the 3 buildings, there is the broad walk, then there is the major road, the main thoroughfare where all cars go on, you will then cross the road, then there is the platform with shallow water where kids all get in and play. In order to get somewhat a view of the one in the photo, you will stand at the side of the platform and look at the buildings across the street. If you thought the enormous pool of water is directly in front of the buildings like the setting of Vegas‚Äôs Bellagio, it is not. If they drain the water from that platform, which they do often, you see nothing but the buildings and the dry roads.","Written September 1, 2019"

France,The Water Mirror,A fabulous urban feature,"Apparently there was great controversy among the people of Bordeaux when the very shallow skim of water was put in front of the old palatial government buildings along the riverbank. There is no question now that it is one of the highlights and gathering spots in Bordeaux for tourists and locals alike. This stretch of water is not only gorgeous for reflecting the buildings, the weather, the skyline, and the scenery but if there is even the slightest bit of warmth on any day you will see children, adults, everyone taking advantage ..not just wading barefoot but even virtually swimming in the 1-2"" there.

1) the temperature in the afternoon is warm in June
2) the mirror image is as complete as the night image but without artificial light

Mankind and dogs enjoy the ground fountain a lot. Water coming out from the ground holes periodically to form a 2cm deep water pool forming the perfect mirror.

France,The Water Mirror,A cool place to pause for thought,"Situated next to the river, it is in fact a collection of water vents that leave a layer of water on a stone level surface which reflects the building across the road until the waters drain away, when they are replaced by further spray.

France,The Water Mirror,Amazing sight and area.,"We have visited this mirroir d'eau several times and it is always fascinating,
There is also a superb carved stone fountain adjacent, which sometimes sports cones or similar paraphanelia eg gilets jaunes!
We would not make a special trip to see it, but if walking in this area of Bordeaux, the area is well worth exploring on foot.
Tripadvisor suggest walks, or one can just wander along the River Garonne eg from Pont Pierre to Bordeaux Quais / quays along Rive gauche. Bordeaux Tourisme do a River Garonne Quay Route walk guide.
Place de la Victoire always seems a bit dodgy to us, but otherwise we have always felt safe in this area.
Whenever we have guests, we always take them on a walk past here and they always enjoy it (or say that they do)
We will undoubtedly go here again, and probably do the Bordeaux Tourisme Garonne Quay route; we would probably avoid high summer cos it is so hot and busy; even in spring and autumn it is very sunny, with lovely blue skys and reflections in the glass windows and water (weathr not guaranteed!)","Written May 22, 2019"
France,The Water Mirror,A must-do for photographers,"This is an impressive tourist attraction - about the size of a football pitch set right in front of 300 year old buildings

The ‚Äúlake‚Äù is an inch or so deep in water and goes though a cycle every half hour or so with a water mist being produced first for a few minutes and then the lake fills with water to form a ‚Äúmirror ‚Äú with great photo opportunities with reflections from the buildings- and then the cycle repeats.

As a hobby photographer, I was waiting for the lake to fill and for the glass-like mirror to form - to get the great reflections photo. But it‚Äôs not that straightforward - there are visitors walking through and making ripples, cyclists and then there‚Äôs the breeze that causes ripples.

So you have to be patient ...

After dark, the buildings are illuminated and you get further opportunities for great photos

In our opinion, a very well thought out attraction - we would recommend it",

France,The Water Mirror,Wonderful fountain,I loved this water fountain that reflected the buildings across the way. The fountain at first floods the area than in 10 minutes it has mist coming out and the reflection is a little blurred. This gives the reflection another version of the buildings across the way.

France,The Water Mirror,WAIT FOR IT......,"I'd read about this place and seen pictures on the internet but didn't quite understand what was going on when I arrived.
It was raining a little when we got there and we couldn't see a reflection in the water. We figured it was because the light rain was causing a ripple. Anyway, we hung around a bit people watching and then notice a sound and then the water started to drain away. Once the water was gone, you cold see a perfect reflection in the wet stone. It was absolutely amazing, we couldn't believe what we were seeing and then while we were happily taking photos, another noise sounded and fog/mist came out of the slits where the water had drained out. This gave another amazing effect.
This place is welol woth the viist at daytime and again and night. It's very clever, but beautiful as well.","Written April 22, 2019"
France,The Water Mirror,Beautiful at Night,"Le Miroir d'Eau is a couple of centimetres of water on top of concrete between the promenade on the left bank of the Garonne and the Place de la Bourse in Bordeaux. It reflects beautifully at night though during the day is much less interesting.

The Miroir was put in place in 2006 as one of the many upgrades Bordeaux experienced at the time. It has become an icon because of the stunning portrait it creates when reflecting the Place de la Bourse at night.

During the day it is quite busy. It is in any case a popular location along the Garonne. At times this particular spot is enhanced by street dance acts or music groups. Being a little bit of water it seems to be a nice place for small children to run around in.

In truth, during the day it is no not especially impressive. For much of the day it reflects very little. Most of the time it is just a small amount of water on concrete. For a large part of the year it is even less than that as the water only appeared mid way through April having ceased for winter.

At night though it is genuinely spectacular. The Place de la Bourse is lit up in three sections but it is enough to reflect the panorama fully in the water. There is a lot of lighting around so avoiding the floodlights means needing to get directly in line with the Fountain of the Three Graces.

At night with everything lit and the reflection dazzling it is beautiful. It is also much less popular at night despite that being easily the best time to see the art of the original concept.

Le Miroir d'Eau is truly impressive. Only at night though and only during the part of the year the water is turned on.","Written April 18, 2019"

Hard finding parking so use the private parking at beginning of promenade. You can walk to rue dantibes a famous strip for clothing and shops.

You should go here for a distracted walk as the sand, sea and a few yachts are so great to see that ones' focus is often blurred. Also suggested is a good pair or polarized sunglasses so as to remain slightly more incognito and discrete to enjoy the view.

France,La Croisette,Lovely but some areas being refurbished,"I have mixed views about the Croisette on this visit. On the one hand it has all the glamour and charm we associate it with. Especially staying over the road at the JW Marriott.

However half the Croisette from the Carlton onwards (away from the centre) is under major renovations and is boarded off whilst they do this major update of the beach and pavements. So the promenade is only running at half the length for a stroll. Hence the half of the promenade that is open is crowded. Only half the beach is open as well.

Also on the week we were there there was a major convention. And the whole Croisette, beaches and hotels were kitted out in a major way with poster boards, marquees etc. so it felt very commercialised for such an iconic strip.

I‚Äôm sure when the upgrade project is finished (2020?) it will all be spectacular but at the moment it‚Äôs all a bit building site/construction zone. They‚Äôve made it as nice as they can with displays on the upgrade. I guess the show must go on.","Written October 27, 2018"

Construction is expected to last another 2-3 years.","Written October 26, 2018"
France,La Croisette,"A lovely location, spoiled by clutter.","We first visited Cannes In 2013 and loved The Croisette immediately. It is a wide promenade beside the beautiful bright blue sea. it holds flowerbeds bursting with plants, colour coordinated really skillfully beneath the graceful and majestic palm trees. Having designed many gardens and worked as a gardening journalist, I appreciate the complicated planting schemes with glowing colours and top quality plants. We were told by a guide that re-planting happened four times a year - the climate being so mild. I have photos of the beautiful beach and people sitting happily by the waves. Last year I took some night time snaps of the coloured lights along the promenade and fairy lights spiralling up the palm trees. It looked magical.
No more - however! The whole of the beach is now cluttered with white plastic cabins and umbrellas. You cannot see the beach at all. The flowers are still there but the whole promenade is so cluttered with kiosks and chairs you cannot see them properly. The Croisette has lost its charm and is the poorer for it.","Written October 16, 2018"

There are cafe and bars and good hotel on beach but its bit costly. It is not a nude beach and its ok to wear bikini for sure but i would not advise being nude or completely carefree, not that people will stare but for you to not feel awkward.

France,La Croisette,Great place,"We spent 4 nights in Cannes and I already can‚Äôt wait to go back. We had a lovely beach club included with our hotel on La Croisette.

I love cars so it was like going to a car show. The beach is lovely and whilst we were there you could watch helicopters flying in all the time and all the amazing boats and was really lovely. Place had a really friendly feel and there are many places to eat nearby and on the beach at the clubs. Cannes is wonderful and having always wanted to go it was better than I had hoped.",

France,La Croisette,A Runner‚Äôs Guide to La Croisette,"If you like a flat jog in the morning to burn off the calories or some over-refreshment from the night before, here is the place to do it.

I personally count La Croisette starting at the furthest East point, technically the Radisson Blu opposite the Marina (le vieux port). The wide pavements and boats with sun shimmering off the calm waters is very soothing.

Then you move on to the Croisette ‚Äòproper‚Äô once you get past the ‚Äòbunker‚Äô where the festivals are held on the right hand side. You have nearly covered a kilometre at this point so don‚Äôt give up!

Then carry on running along the plage side if the Croisette - don‚Äôt be tempted to run along the pavements fronting the prime shops or fabulous hotels: the pedestrian and vehicular traffic is overwhelming. Besides, you get a better view of the scenery from the wide open pavements and landscaping fronting the sea.

Keep going all the way around to the far harbour - about a 3k trot - and marvel at the scale of the yachts berthed there and wonder at how The tax man could miss such obvious targets to ill-declared enterprise. It makes for a fine morning. My favourite! By my reckoning, it is a 5k round trip. On the way back, stop off in the old town, just past or behind the Town Hall, for some authentic French chow.","Written March 19, 2018"

France,La Croisette,"A great location for people watching, from the blue metal seats.","The Promenade de la Croisette, stretching for over three kilometres and the true heart of Cannes, was built in the second half of the 19th century, but its current incarnation dates to its complete renovation back in the 1960s. Its name comes from a cross that was a site of pilgrimage, standing on the promontory between Cannes and the bay of Golfe-Juan. Similar to the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, this boardwalk is a wonderful place for a walk the shade of the palm trees, or to soak up the sun and the sea breeze. For those with more money than sense there are many bars, restaurants on one side and beach clubs on the beach. Luxury shops such as Louis Vuitton or Chanel, as well as five-star hotels like the Le Canberra, the Splendid, the famous Carlton Hotel or the oldest one, Le Grand Hotel line the street. The Cannes Film Festival is hosted every year with a red carpet that reaches the boulevard from the bunker-like Palais des Festivals. The A-list stars drop anchor at Pierre Canto Marina, at the far end of the boardwalk, during the Film Festival, and the smaller Port de la Pointe Croisette is a marina for sailing boats at end of boulevard. Children are not forgotten either as La Croisette has play areas at either end with a small funfair at the Palais des Festival end - there are remote control boats, game galleries, and a merry go round. There are many free events and activities such as music concerts, during the summer months. A great location for people watching, from the blue metal seats, from where you can also appreciate the sports cars gliding along the boulevard. Despite the crowds of people and the frankly annoying and dangerous slate boards the views of the Est√©rel mountains across the Baie de Cannes are stunning, while the seafront art-deco hotels light up the night skies stunning glory.","Written March 10, 2018"

France,Old Town,The headquarters of fairy tale villages,"We stayed in old town of Colmar while on summer vacation in France. Colmar has good train and bus connections with other parts of France and nearby countries so we decided not to rent a car.
Only 15 minutes walk from the modern train station we found an old town of Colmar well preserved with its colourful timber buildings. Its medieval charm took us back in time. The old town is located between Quartier de la Krutenau (Little Venice) and the Theatre on the other end, between streets: Rue des Tetes, Rue des Clefs and Rue des Marchands.Every building here tells an interesting story of past centuries. The oldest house in Colmar dates from 1350 and it is called Adolph house (located on 16 Place de la cathedrale) near the famous cathedrale St Martin. The central place of the old town is the Cathedrale St Martin. It would be visible from most locations in case you wander off through narrow cobblestone streets.

The old town is packed with restaurants, patisseries and shops and it is a paradise for eyes and taste buds. You have to try delicious candied fruits and vanilla flan (french custard cake), not to mention ice-cream.

This is a town of plenitude, so much to see and do. My favourite place is Little Venice a postcard perfect canal, however I really liked the bar terrace on the water within covered markets located near Little Venice. This was my favourite place to have a coffee and relax.
In the evenings, the famous Koifhus Square becomes full of life with many restaurants being open for a dinner. This square and the fountain Schwendi is also worth visiting during the day. One of the most popular buildings in Colmar not to be missed is the House of heads whose fa√ßade has 106 human heads carved in stone.
Colmar is surrounded by many fascinating little villages that can be visited by a local bus from the main train station or the bus station at the Theatre. Our favourites are: Ribeauvill√©, Riquewihr, Kaysersberg and Eguisheim which is only 7 km away from Colmar and it can also be reached by train. The capital town of Alsace Strasbourg is only 30 minutes away from Colmar.
While in Colmar we discovered the Statue of Liberty in its full size in industrial area of Colmar about 20 minutes by bus from the old town. The Sculptor who made the Statue of Libery was born in Colmar.
Tip: If you ever need to go to a food store, Monoprix is a large food store with almost everything you can imagine. You can get there freshly squeezed orange juice in the bottle.",

You had to make your way, the best you could, twisting your ankles, and constantly in the absence of a path working out where to go.

Initially was a road for a car, then took right to go on a red route (walking only). When we got to the top, red/blue/white sign was shown to the left, and red only route to the right. We were recommended to take red only route going to right (which will climb a bit further to the right then start a moderate decent) by the locals because of pregnancy. What I noticed was the tourists were all going for the combined blue/red/white route from the top (left), where locals were going to the right. From the bus stop we took about an hour to Calanque du Sormiou. There are cafe just at the beginning of walking route (around the corner from bus stop) and at the Calanque. No fresh water otherwise so we brought plenty of water (and sandwich too!). On the way back, the same route upwards were a bit difficult for pregnant body (advises by locals) so we walked on the car route completely towards Sormiou village instead, which takes about 1 hour.

France,Parc National des Calanques,A must see if you are in the area!,"I wanted to go hiking in the calenques but make sure you ask at the any of the Tourist Offices before you plan this (especially in the peak/hot season) as some of the paths were closed. I ended up taking a boat tour instead. I highly recommend the Grand Circuit from Marseille if you have time - it's about 3 1/2 hours and you get to see all the main calanques between Marseille and Cassis. I would have preferred to go walking with a picnic and to spend the day in one of the calanques swimming, eating and relaxing but unfortunately this wasn't an option for me. The only downside to the Grand Tour was that the entire commentary was in French - nothing in English. The scenery was however nice enough to just enjoy without understanding what was being said but an English commentary or information booklet would have been appreciated.","Written August 9, 2019"
France,Parc National des Calanques,Beautiful however had to walk in boiling sun and poor amenties,We had to walk 3km in the grueling heat with no shade through winding paths or on the winding road as were not allowed to drive down to the calenque. Be sure to make a reservation at a restaurant to ensure you can park or go with a tour. I recommend voicing your concerns to Marseille tourism as they really need to improve this experience for visitors. At the moment only locals have free access. The also down point is many spots dont have adequate toilets or any showers. Everything was falling a part. Security could also be improved since we spoke to local police who told us to be careful with cameras and warned us they couldnt help us as they were only there to help the security team control traffic. Wow!,"Written August 5, 2019"
France,Parc National des Calanques,"Stunning scenery, hiking, climbing, swimming","This park is made up of limestone cliffs rising up out of the Mediterranean and includes calanques (inlets/creeks) that end in beautiful beaches/swimming spots.

Go online to see pictures (calanques13.com). It looks more grandiose and beautiful in person than it does in the pictures (and that‚Äôs saying something as the pictures are the reason I went)!

There are a lot of ways to enjoy the park. Boat in or hike in. Then, hike, climb, or swim (we did all three) to your heart‚Äôs content. Or just find a place to take in the majestic views.

Warning- Hot as hell in the summer.","Written July 23, 2019"
France,Parc National des Calanques,Absolutely divine,"The stunning natural beauty of the Calanques along the South Coast of France is a must do.

From there it was about 1 1/2 hours down to Calanque Sugiton. There a few different ways going down which vary in difficulty. I would still recommend to put shoes and bring enough water and someyhing to eat since you can't buy anything there.
You get rewarded with nice views of the valley and a swim in the ocean. Depending on the day be prepared to share the rocky coastline with a lot of other people.
When you get up, you can also go up to a nice lookout.",
France,Parc National des Calanques,Spectacular Drive,"This is a huge national park with an amazing coast, the latter having spectacular cliffs and narrow inlets. The drive through the park from Marseilles to Cassis can be a white knuckle event as you rise to almost 4000 feet traversing numerous switchbacks with steep roadside dropoffs that give you real nail biting experiences. The views however are spectacular!

France,Parc National des Calanques,Beautiful Scenery,"This national park stretches along the coast for about 20 miles between Marseille and Cassis in Southern France. It features a series of bays and rocky cliffs and offers hiking, swimming and rock climbing. Though visitors can get to the park using public transport, rental boats and boat tours with stops, we did not have the needed time on our day trip to Marseille. Instead, we took a basic two-and-one-half-hour boat cruise with no stops and simply admired the scenery.

Our cruise started from the Vieux Port and offered a commentary in French. We sat outside on the warm, sunny April day, enjoying the views and being on the water. The boat passed a long stretch of high, rocky promontories, composed of limestone or dolomite, rising from the Mediterranean Sea. They sometimes revealed idyllic inlets with lovely bays and water that displayed a variety of blues.

Though I would have preferred to have been hiking or swimming in the park, this cruise was a good way to get a feeling for the area. And during certain periods of the summer, entering the park is off limits because of fire danger, so a cruise would be a good alternative. Information on the park and ways to get there can be found at the Marseille Tourist Office, 11 la Canebiere, next to the Vieux Port metro station.","Written March 1, 2019"

France,Parc National des Calanques,unique bays and hills,"We took three buses from Marseille to get out to the calanque at Callalongue and that was an experience itself as the locals were all friendly, especially the bus driver in the small bus out along the coast. We were lucky to have a beautiful clear cold day so the views were magnificent. There is an orientation board en route to help with identifying the headlands and islands. Once you arrive there are various walks, some of them quite steep. We chose to wander up the valley before having lunch in the wonderful cafe de la grotte. The service and the food was very good especially the pain perdu, which must be ordered in advance. There is only one bus an hour into this callanque (in winter?) so we opted to walk back along the coast, although the bus driver offered us a ride when he overtook us partway along. We were glad we had started from the first stop as the bus back into town got extremely crowded by the time it got there. Despite the cold and wind I am glad we went in winter as I imagine it gets very crowded in summer.

France,Parc National des Calanques,Incredible to Look At,"I didn't get to explore the park itself but I did a ferry tour around the area and it was absolutely stunning. I'd love to go back and explore it properly one day.

It's such a beautiful place and being out on the water on board a ferry was a magical experience so I can't imagine how enchanting it would be to actually go swimming or diving in the area. Even just exploring the park would be a full day.

The cliffs are pretty unique and beautiful, and it's disappointing the tour was in French as I didn't learn anything about the area. I imagine it has a pretty fascinating history.

The tour was around 2-3hrs and I'd highly recommend it as a fast way to experience this natural beauty. This is one for the nature lovers, and a really relaxing way to spend the afternoon.",

Little Kays or creeks everywhere ans some of them offer a place to berth and enjoy an ap√©ritif, a lunch, a cup of coffee or all three, why not? C‚Äô est la France.

To get to Calanque de Sugiton, take bus 21J or B21 from metro stops Castellane or Rond Point du Prado. Get off the bus when you get to Luminy Campus (just before you go into the campus, you'll see some bus stops on the opposite side of the street). Once you've left the bus, hike through the car park to the entrance and you can follow a number of different coloured paths (we did the yellow, then red-dotted path).

We started our journey from Luminy following first the yellow line (Very easy wide path, kids and elderly people can do it), and after turned on the red line towards to our first destination Sugiton. The landscape is amazing, all the time I was taking pictures . You arrive to a lagoon where you can swim. Tiny place, and busy time is packed but worth to stay there a bit. On the way back to Luminy we turned left and started our trip to Morgiou, this trail is bit more difficult, especially when you arrive to the point where you have to go down holding the chain. Worth it, there is a little beach and port, and you can buy a drink for yourself. Apart from this place we did not find anything to buy drink. So make sure you bring plenty of water.

We found parking in the nearby residential area - be prepared for it to be busy and the actual car park to be full. We followed the path (& other people) and found ourselves at Calanque de Port Pin - stunning! The walk as a little ‚Äòexciting‚Äô and slippery in places but our unpreparedness was mostly to blame. The calanque was busy but that‚Äôs to be expected on a weekend and beautiful weather. The water is crystal clear and although a bit cool it was a gorgeous swim.
We had such a lovely day that we returned the next day - better prepared this time with proper footwear, backpacks & plenty of water and food. We ended up making it all the way to Calanque d‚Äôen vau. It was about 1.5 hour ‚Äòwalk‚Äô there - some areas of walking but also a fair bit of steep inclines both up & down and even some almost vertical rock scrambling. Absolutely thrilling - our children (10 & 8) loved it. On getting to calanque d‚Äôen vau we were blown away - got to be seen to be believed.

France,Parc National des Calanques,Unforgettable adventure:),"Really loved every single moment of this natural beauty place.
Had to take a bus to the Luminy, and then walk for and hike for about 30minutes to reach the beach which is not accessible very easily, you actually have to have two hands free to hold on to anything you find not to fall!!!! (Wearing a dress was very bad idea hahha)
The weather in July was fantastic, we spent around 2 hours swimming and sunbathing in this mesmerising little pebbly beach.
Really recommend packing little lunch pack and plenty of water!!!!:)",
France,Parc National des Calanques,Spectacular Hike and Views - Plan to eat lunch there too,"Wow, this was a gorgeous hike! We were informed by our hotel to make a reservation at the restaurant early in the morning and we are sure glad we did. It is also important to point out that you also need to bring cash. The hike was spectacular and there were herbs of Provence scattered everywhere on the hillsides. It was wonderful to breath in the fresh sea air. Absolute must if you are in the area.","Written August 27, 2018"
France,Parc National des Calanques,Boat trip to Calanque,"Calanque is French for Creek. They are small inlets into the land with interesting rock formations and blue sea. However there isn't any Sandy beaches as the rock forms smaller rocks under the sea bed / beach area. So wear comfortable swim shoes. The large boat we caught from Vieux Port could not go down all of the different Calanques due to its size, if your budget allows hire a smaller boat with the opportunity to swim. The views are stunning and a nice break from city life that is really close to the city. The narrative from the boat co. Was only in French.",

France,Parc National des Calanques,Superb. Do this over the other ways of seeing the calanques!,"We debated (a lot) whether to do by foot, by bus/transport, or by boat or private boat. The calanques are lovely, but in my opinion only if you can snorkel and enjoy looking up the cliffs, rather than down and out to sea. You can get a view anywhere in Marseille frankly, it is about being involved the other side i.e. from sea!!

France,Parc National des Calanques,Do Yourself a Favor and visit Belvedere du Sugiton in Calanques National Park,"Prior to arriving in Marseille, I had read about and heard Calanques National Park was a must see. I had researched going to Cassis and walking to Calanques or taking a boat cruise from Marseille. Neither seemed appealing. We wanted to Calanques from above and not from the water because the perspective is entirely different.

Then, through further research, I found there is a view point called Belvedere du Sugiton and you can reach it by bus and on foot!

From Marseille, take Bus 21 all the way to the last stop - Luminy. Once you get off the bus, walk straight up the hill and within a few minutes you will be at the entrance of the trail to the Belvedere de Sugiton. The walk took us about 30 minutes.

If you are unsure, just type in Belvedere du Sugiton on Google Maps on your phone and just follow the path. It is easy.

We arrived at around 8 am and it was already starting to get hot. We came on July 4.

Bring an umbrella for shade because there are very few shady places. Walking in, we only encountered a few people but by the time we were walking out at around 9 am, there was a steady stream of people. If you want to avoid the heat, come as early as possible.

Once you get to the Belvedere, the views are amazing with the limestone cliffs. It is worth the 30-35 minute walk to get here and the bus is super convenient. We paid 5.20 euros for an all day public transport ticket for Marseille which included all buses. We returned on Bus 21 as well.

I am so glad we did this and I am so glad we could do it on our own and the level of effort was minimal.",

From there, it is better to ask for directions, to reach the location itself, cause it's a relatively narrow road through mountains. If you will go by walking, it takes you a few hours, so it's good to have something to eat with you. If you get tired easily, I guess better to rent a car or bike, maybe.

France,Parc National des Calanques,20 km of wild and rugged terrain,"Marseille is encircled by hills, the only 3 ways to get in or out are by road east or west of the city or by boat through the harbour. The city was hard to invade in ancient times and still hard to navigate now due to traffic.
The Calanques are the cliffs protecting the city from the sea. Between cliffs, once small cabins housing fishermen are now prized summer cottages for Marseille residents. Marseille beaches are rocky, few of the beaches have sand, unless it has been brought in.
One of the easy way to visit is to take a boat that explore the calanques available on le Vieux Port.",

It was beautiful and very busy at the beach at Port Pin and on the path with serious walkers and others visiting for the day. It was absolutely gorgeous at every turn. This was a great day out, with some serious exercise. A must visit if your are in Marseille or Cassis.

Word of warning, be sensible and only do this with proper walking shoes or sturdy trainers. It is quite challenging with loose rocks and steep climbs. Take at least two litres of water with you if you are walking to the other Callanques and sun cream and a hat. Even in April it was very warm and the sun strong.",

For some locations, a care might be handy, but we took city buses to a beautiful area on the sea south of the city. Bikes could easily have been an option. We hiked briefly into the fractured limestone hills before settling in on a small calanaque only walking distance from the end of the bus line.

France,Parc National des Calanques,A must see when in southern France,"The Parc National des Calanques is a gorgeous national park located near the seaside village of Cassis. The landscape features breathtaking cliffs and inlets, and beaches that can be seen by boat or on foot. We were on a day-trip out of Toulon where our cruise ship docked, and this was something that our driver thought we should see. He was right. I had never even heard of a calanque but discovered they were narrow, steep-walled inlets developed in limestone and found along the Mediterranean coast. They are beautiful. It is true that pictures don‚Äôt do the bright, turquoise water justice. People were sunbathing on the tiny beaches and at one calanque, people were rock climbing and repelling down the cliffs. The locals go to the Parc and hike to the inlets but tourists with limited time must limit themselves to the boat tour. We choose GIE des Bateliers which offered several different boat tours based on time and the number of inlet coves you wanted to visit. One negative aspect was that the narration was only in French. Despite the language barrier, we enjoyed ourselves. I wish we would have had more time. Maybe someday we can come back and hike down to one of the coves.","Written December 2, 2017"

The rough road called Route Gaston Rebuffat had a negotiable barrier (warning against continuing if it was windy - a fire risk). A 1km drive to a parking area and then walking down an easy winding path for 4.5 km to a stoney beach. In October it was sunny in part until 12.00. Boating and swimming is possible. There is no harbour or jetty. There are no facilities. Make sure you take any litter back the same way way as you brought it.",
France,Parc National des Calanques,Pleasant trip,Nice way to see the port from the sea. English wasn‚Äôt spoken on our trip only French. We were given a prepared booklet to read in English. We went on the 2.5 hour trip and visited two the bays. It was of medium interest.,"Written October 10, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,Beautiful place to hike or sun bathe,"For us using the GPS was a bit hard to find for some reason. We paid for parking which was located up above the main road that leads to the park so it was a bit of a walk just to get to the park entrance. You don't need to pay 8 euros for parking...there are some parking spaces at the entrance of the park for free. However, parking is scarce so be on the lookout. There are no restaurants or shops, just one snack stand at the park parking. Beautiful scenery with places to swim and sun bathe. Would recommend good shoes as a lot of the rocks that form the path are very slippery because they are so smooth.","Written October 7, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,Beautiful place to visit,"We took the regular boat tour (tickets and embankment from the Old Port) and had a wonderful time seeing the beautiful naturally sculpted rocks of the park as well as the small beaches and wonderful water.

France,Parc National des Calanques,By far the highlight of my trip,The calanques are unlike any sea inlet I've come across before. The water is deep turquoise and the cliffs are massive! You can visit by boat but I would suggest setting off on foot from cassis and go and check the views from higher up before walking down into the gorges. Wear decent footwear and take plenty of water as some of the paths are very steep.,

Great views of the city and port when coming in!",
France,Parc National des Calanques,The most beautiful place I've ever seen,"I wanted to come here after seeing some pictures and I wasn't disappointed. It's pretty easy to get to by bus.
I wouldn't bother with fancy tours and cruises, just catch the bus and wander around,you can't go wrong.
The mountains with the alpine heath vegetation were stunning and the water was beautiful.
The architecture of the structures is interesting and gives a feel of the age of the place.
A must for any nature lover.",
France,Parc National des Calanques,Don't miss this one of a kind place!,"This was the highlight of my 10 day trip to France. Who would think that France could offer a natural attraction so divinely beautiful. This is a series of limestone cliffs and offer hidden beaches, pristine blue/green waters and incredible views of the Mediterranean. From Marseille city it takes 30mins to reach the starting point by bus. One can even drive to this place but the best way to explore this is by trekking. There are no clear paths and one must enjoy the anticipation to discover. I took the path to explore Calanque de Sugiton as its one of the shortest treks and also a beautiful one. The beach below is small and cosy; good to take a dip in the clear waters and jump from a large rock there. Carry lots of water and food- keep 5 hours to a full day. Access to the park is free but might be prohibited due to wildfire concerns so one has to check online before visiting.","Written September 22, 2017"

France,Parc National des Calanques,A must do in Marseille,"Blue cristal water for this amazing place between Marseille and Cassis. As we say here, if you saw Paris but not Cassis you saw nothing.","Written September 17, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,Breathtaking but also super exhausting,"So we did the hike from Cassis, to Port Miou, Port Pin and En Vau. Getting to Port Pin was not a problem, and we were there in the morning, so not so many people, looking back we should have relaxed in there a bit longer, the swimming was lovely. But we soon went on to En Vau. First you go a long way up from Potrt Pin. And then - the descent to get there is tricky, people are not exaggerating when they say wear hiking shoes. Ther are many sections with loose little stones that are slipping away below your feet, and parts where you have to basically climb a steep slippery rock with not much to hold on to. Still, that was not too bad for me (not so much for my boyfriend who is afraid of heights, he thought he would die there :)). The calanque itself is lovely, but even at the very end of August and during the week, it got extremely packed. I think it is sold as this quiet haven and that it is not! Still the color of water was unbelievable and the views when you swam in between those rocks, awesome! I was happy I had my water shoes, the rocks there are very uncomfortable on bare feet.
The way back. Oh my god. I don't think I have ever been that exhausted in my life. The climb up was excrutiating... Then we walked the path around the edges back to Port Pin, views were breathtaking, but it was a very long way all the way back to Cassis (the walk around Port Miou seemed endless, even though that one is at least flat).
P.S. As others said, no refreshments along the way, bring water and food! A chocolate bar saved me towards the end...",
France,Parc National des Calanques,Must see!,"Wow what a beautiful park full of hiking trails, little villages and beaches. It was stunning from top to bottom. We couldn't drive up due to the risk of forest fires so we had to hike up the road. We then took our first right through a trail at the peak of the road. Beautiful sights and photo chances and then turned around back to the road. We went down the other side of the peak towards the beach. Walking on the road non stop to the beach town would take an hour. This little town was adorable, very quiet and did not have many amenities. There is a little restaurant however we did not go. To the left of the marina you can walk down to a rocky beach that is very private with clear water and a nice place to swim. We hiked the black and then blue trail back which begins on the right side of the marina and it was very difficult. This is not a park for the young, weak or old. Cliff edges, loose rocks and very steep incline. It was worth every drop of sweat but front start of the parking lot to finish it was 4.5 hours (we stopped at the beach for 30 minutes) certainly have runners on, lots and lots and lots of water as well as a hat or something suitable for the sun. We didn't See any wild life and there was nothing that made us feel unsafe. Hopefully we will be back to the south of France again and enjoy maybe the white and red trail! Happy Hiking!","Written September 13, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,Must see!,"Today we finaly got to our hike in Parc national des Calanques, before you start, make sure you are allowed to access the parc. A lot of times the parc is closed because there is a heavy risk of fire. There is a special number to call +33 (0)811 201 313 (No wurries, it's a computer and it ""speaks"" English... :) Make sure you have the postal code ready. We started in the area of Baumettes so it is 13009.
On our first try we did not make the call and could return home, so please make sure to call.

The national park is beautiful, the routes are signposted very well, but also challenging. Some parts had to be climbed considerably. It wasn't a easy walk. The views are phenomenal and certainly worth the climb. I would definitely recommend this park and hope to come back again.",
France,Parc National des Calanques,Oh my god!!!!,"Breathtaking.

All I will say is it's not for elderly and not for very young children.
We parked our car outside the park them walked in, and didn't know what we we were heading towards????
We walked a little until we came to a mountain and had no choice but to keep going follow the red sign

It got steeper deeper.
But I must admit it was a beautiful experience and the scenic views are jaw dropping .

It's about 1 h4 maybe 1hr 15mins walk will take longer if you stop to take pictures.

Once you get to the beautiful beach you have to leave on time to go back up those mountains back where you came from where you parked your car and it can get tiring.
Wear comfy shoes
Make sure your fit.
Have a bottle water with you.
Enjoy.

I had a knee injury didn't know what i was in for but took a risk.
It was worth it for me and now deep heat every night and fixing this knee injury .

The area has pretty rocky and uneven ground so be careful, go on a cooler day and bring something too eat and lots of water (then again maybe there is a shortcut we didn't know about). Once you make it all the way there is beautiful clear blue water and a gorgeous view of all the surrounding cliffs.

France,Parc National des Calanques,Absolutely amazing area,"We walked from Cassis to Calanque de Port Pin and Calanque d'en Vau.

Stunning scenery along the way and the beaches were beautiful with clear, emerald blue water.

It is a bit of a trek (to see both probably 5 km all up each way) but worth it. Recommend wearing sneakers/hiking boots for the walk (as parts are very rocky with loose stones) and bring along thongs for the beach. Also goggles or snorkels to explore the wonderful underwater paradise.",

This was fantastic - our trip lasted 3.5 hours in total and took us into many of the calanques (alcoves/bays) during our visit. The sea here was crystal blue. Unfortunately our boat trip did not allow us to go for a swim, however I know some of the smaller boats companies promoted this.

So we took a metro Veux-Port (in Old port) went to stations to Castellane (the ticket is 2 euro).
Went out and took Bus #21 (follow the signs, it's easy).
You can use the same ticket for Metro and Bus (goes every 20 min).
Then we went about 20 min till the last stop.
The entrance to the park is just by the bus stop.
So it costs just 4 euro per person both ways.
We walked about 15 min following blue-yellow route (you can see small lines on the trees - see the picture). At the point where you see the sea we took the red route - down to the sea, walked 30 more min. The place was very beautiful!!!",

France,Parc National des Calanques,"Amazing, but be ready","The Parc de Calanques is one of the most breathtaking sites I've ever visited. The inlets, the cliffs, the vivid colour of the Mediterranean are enough to make you fall in love with it.
The feeling of walking through the steep cliffs when reaching the Calanque d'En-Vau is absolutely thrilling!

A couple things to know before you set off:
1- The easiest way to reach it is by taking the bus from Marseille, as it'll leave you right in Cassis and only a couple minutes walk away from the entrance of the park. Be careful not to miss the last bus though as it's easy to forget time and the buses are VERY crowded in high season and you may simply not get a spot.
2- There are no signs per say inside the park, but if you notice, there are small painted rocks with coloured lines. Those are the signs pointing you in the right direction. If all else fails, follow the huge amount of people trying to get to En-Vau
3- Be ready for a hike. To reach En-Vau takes a bit of time, and don't expect to be there and back in one hour. Take water and snacks or sandwiches to picnic at the Calanque when you reach it, you won't regret it.
4- If you're really scared of heights, you may want to consider stopping at Port-Pin (though I would suggest pressing on and conquering your fears as I did!). There is a near vertical wall to climb down to reach En-Vau, with no handrails, ropes or hand holds of any sort, and the stones have been polished by millions of hikers.

That being said, I wouldn't miss it for the world.","Written August 10, 2017"

France,Parc National des Calanques,Disappointing,"We went to Cassis and got a boat trip to 3 calanques which took 45 mins. It was ok. The calanques are inlets and the first two we sea were not that interesting. The third one was much more impressive with steep, high cliffs. I think the calanques further up the coast from Cassis are more impressive.","Written August 7, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,The only reason it's not a 5 is the lack of signs,"How do I get started?!
This place is a true hidden gem, Marseille will surprise you and maybe disappoint you a bit, yet going to Cassis will raise the bar, specially the Parc National des Calanques, wherever you walk or aim for a long hike you will always be rewarded with great scenery and a magical beach to cool off the heat.

I would have given it 5 if only there were signs to the calanques d'en vau or any other calanques, in order to reach one of the calanques -the one right before d'en vau- I got lost, asked for directions and then followed the crowd, at some point I thought I arrived then someone told me it takes another hour, there wasn't even a sign that says which calanques was it. I was worried from the lack of signs, and the heat got its toll on me so I just stopped at this point and enjoyed the beach.
There should be signs hanging everywhere and water stations too, one must be geared with 2-3 liters of freezing water -I only had half a liter and bought an ice cream from the only food & refreshments station on site- in order to survive the hike, it's not hard yet slippery and the weather can be extremely hot.

We walked/hiked from Cassis to ""En Vau"", passing two other Calanques along the way. The hike was very steep in places, and a gentle walk in others. Sneakers or hiking shoes are a must. The views and the swimming were well worth the effort!",
France,Parc National des Calanques,My favorite day trip in the whole world!,"Be prepared to fall in love if you love the ocean. Take the ferry from the Vieux Port, it is a 3 hour trip with very cool breeze and stunning views. I cannot stop thinking about it and I already miss the place. I want to go back!","Written July 5, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,"Beautiful town, nice boat ride, interesting Calanques!","Cassis is a beautiful little town with great views and many options for seeing the Calanques. We opted for the 45 minute (3 calanques) boat ride as we had a full schedule that day. It was fun, and interesting! Wish we had more time in Cassis and more time to hike!","Written July 1, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,Absolutely worth it,"We were a family of three with a 20month infant. Thus the options of hiking and going on a 2.5 hours boat journey was out.

We started from Calanque et parc du Mugel in La Ciaotat. From the dedicated parking zone the walk is ten minutes only to the beach. Tariff minimum at 2‚Ç¨ for 2 hours. Beach is stony and limited shade so carry correct footwear and other accessories. Snorkeling is possible. Parc is well maintained - with a 20-25 minute hike you can reach the Belvedere or a view point; it is worth it. There are two beaches one large and another small accessible easily and doable.

Next stop La Calanques des Figuerolles - same as above parking is close by and paid.

Later continue the 6Km Routes des Cr√©tes which offers stunning views of the Calanques. The route ends in Cassis.

We had a swim at the beach next to parking 'La Madie' in Cassis next to the two Michelin Star restaurant they have a nice brasserie too. At the roundabout towards City centre you could even get options from Spar and fast food.

In all spent 8hours with sufficient time for the water activities. Comfortable trip and stunning views.","Written June 29, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,Go to Cassis First,"First of all make sure you get the best and most appropriate transport deal. If you are staying a week or more please do yourself a favour and get a travel card. Go to one of the metro info offices with a passport type photo, look suitably lost and a kind person will take you to the machine and walk you through the process. For 13 euros or so you can now travel on any bus tram or metro -if you mix and match its a great way to see the city and you can even take a boat ride to both sides of the bay. I can't recommend it enough and I reckon we saved about 200 euros in a fortnight. It also allows you discounts eg on the bus to Cassis, which is about 40 mins away and from where you can take a boat trip to three or more calanques. We chose the shorter trip since we didn't have time for a swim and we wanted to visit a vineyard . You basically wait for a reasonably empty boat, and grab the seats you fancy. The calanques are enchanting filled with the Beautiful People sunbathing on the rocky ledges and you can see the walking paths higher up.The boat captain was knowledgable and with an amusing line of patter. A very worthwhile trip.","Written June 26, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,Beautiful Stretch of Coast/Delightful Boat Trip,"When it's hot in town, there is no better option than to get out on or in the water. Both are possible while taking in the beautiful coast east of Marseille in the adjacent national park. There are numerous boats/operators to choose from leaving from both Marseille and Cassis. It is absolutely a delightful change of pace from the land based sight-seeing in and around Marseille. Highly recommended and bring your swim suit/towel!","Written June 25, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,One of the memorable drives,"Add it to the list of your memorable drives (Route in in California. Amalfi Coast). Windy road, with some great lookout points.","Written June 25, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,"Hard way, good experience","I was very proud of myself for making it...don't do it on your own unless you are an experienced walker hiker or such.
I was lucky to be able to join a local couple, without them I'd never have made it to the goal...
It is a lot of hassle, but uf you like a challenge - there you go...
At the end it is nice, but maybe a beach with access is just as nice...
The view is beautiful, and the road is more exciting maybe uf you are a romantic couple, looking to bond - if not, be careful, not only physically risky, may also drive you to get on each other's nerves.
Not for very hot days, and better bring food and drinks with you, go early and have the day to stay",
France,Parc National des Calanques,Beautiful Mediterranean land and sea,"We toured via Bleu Evasion and saw the beautiful and unique rocky shores from the water. We saw plentyt of folks hiking and sunbathing, but on such a hot day, a boat ride was the best way to see this National Park.","Written June 22, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,Magnifique !!!,"If you want to feel the nature and get it touch with Sea, Mountain this is the best place to visit.

France,Parc National des Calanques,Beautiful!,"We had a lovely day hiking around this national park! It was incredibly beautiful, but it was truely a HIKE not just a simple walk. On some places we had to climbe cliffs, I thought it was quite difficult at times. It was totally worth it though! Bring some lunch and spend the day here :) we took bus 24 to Luminy, where you easily can start your hike.

We recommend it strongly!!",
France,Parc National des Calanques,Best beach in France?,"At the end of Calanques you can find the lagoon beach where you can dip in to the clear blue water of the sea. The easiest way to get there is to take the bus number 21 from Castellane metro station (bring small cash, ticket is 2 euros one-way) and then walk to the beach from the final stop. The walk is about 30 minutes and during a hot day it can be quite exhausting because you need to walk first up and then down, but it truly is worth it!",
France,Parc National des Calanques,Beautiful mini fiords in southern France,"East of Marseille, near the village of Cassis, is a gorgeous national park. Park National des Calanques has beautiful cliffs and inlets and can be seen by boat, on foot, or bike. We rented bikes with battery assist and had a wonderful tour of the Calanques. Without the battery assist some of the hills would have been quite strenuous for occasional mountain bikers.","Written June 10, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,Wonderful boat trip!,Enjoyed the boat trip to the Calanques. You have a choice between 2 or 3 hr trip and we took the 3 hour trip and we were not disappointed! The only negative was that the narration was in French and our French was a bit rusty but that did not take away from the beautiful scenic views.,"Written June 9, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,Gorgeous views,"If you like hiking, be ready to spend a couple hours there. It is a big park and the ocean view is great. There is no facilities around, so, don't forget to bring with you something to eat and drink. Once it is by the ocean, it is a bit windy. There are different treks you can choose from and you have just to follow the signs. Simple access via public transport is available.","Written June 9, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,Breathtaking and the Sexy,"You can't imagine how stunningly beautiful
This area is. Be careful, don't drive this.-
Particularly if you have been drinking wine.
Get a taxi or driver, from your Hotel. It's not expensive.

Don't go into Marseille/ truly
Dangerous as is ,Toulouse.
The French truck drivers are monsters , they don't
Signal and people go 80-100 miles an hour.
Hire taxi or driver at Hotel. Take public transport. There are buses.

Only drink the local wines which are magnificent and very very inexpensive

Rhine wine is the wine of the region.

You will never regret doing this trip.
God Bless the Gulf of Lion.","Written June 6, 2017"

France,Parc National des Calanques,BREATHTAKING !!,Amazing trek you can organise in this Parc. Don't forget to take snacks and water. Follow the signs . It's very important not to get lost . You have different trek you can choose from. I recommend 1000% this place . It's amazingly beautiful,
France,Parc National des Calanques,Absolutely gorgeous scenery off the Route des Cretes,"After making the mistake of renting a car for our stay in Marseille, we drove out of town towards Cassis with the intention of stopping there and taking a boat ride out to see the islands. Cassis was full of people and had no place to park, so we continued on through town and found the Route des Cretes. This winds all through the park, with lots of pull-offs for pictures taking and sighing. At the end of the route you are near La Ciotat, where you can take the freeway back to Marseilles. This trip alone made the idiocy of renting a car and suffering the chaos of the city center in traffic, absolutely worthwhile! The views are stunning. We even ran across a bride and groom doing their wedding pictures there.","Written May 26, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,I am out of words,"I visited more than 60 countries and I've never seen such beautiful place
We took a boat for 3h45 to see all ""les calanques ""
The view is breathtaking you'll never forget it
I wish I could swim but the water was freezing
Definitely I am coming back just to swim
It's a must see if u stop by the south of France",
France,Parc National des Calanques,Stunning,"We visited the Calanques by boat, with was a very funny experience because we sat on the top of the boat and got completely wet. There were several people feeling sick because the sea was rough that day, but we had a great time, thankfully. The Calanques are very beautiful and unique, it's a shame we didn't get a chance to go for a swim. Maybe next time.","Written May 24, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,What a beautiful place,We had the privilege to do a 3 hour cycling tour of a portion of the area. It is truly beautiful. The clear blue sea with the white cliffs is more beautiful than on any of the pictures. As must see if you are an outdoor/nature lover.,"Written May 24, 2017"
France,Parc National des Calanques,A must see for Marseille visitors!,"The calanques provide an unforgettable experience, with stunning views at every turn. Simplest access comes via public transit (another plus), though parking is available. You will find trails for a wide range of ability and experience; use an accurate self-assessment to decide if you'd prefer a simple hike or one requiring more expertise. Some of the routes carry risk of a fall--choose wisely according to your ability. We visited about a half dozen different calanques during our time in Marseille, and each provided its own charm. The reward at the end is always worth it. It's amazing to think that this rugged, gorgeous location resides a short trip away from the hustle and bustle of Marseille. Wear comfortable, durable hiking shoes and bring plenty of water; refill opportunities are limited.

Pay attention to the weather reports. Visits can be limited during dry season, when the risk of fire is higher.","Written May 23, 2017"

France,Parc National des Calanques,Beautiful Rock Formation,"Took an hour boat ride from the fishing village of Cassis which is about a 40 min drive outside of Marseille. The ferry took us to see the beautiful rock formation in this national park, with brief stops in the coves/inlets. Day was not windy but the waters were very choppy so be prepared. One can easily get sea sick.","Written May 17, 2017"
