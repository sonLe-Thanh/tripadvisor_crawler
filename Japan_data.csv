Japan,Universal Studios Japan,My 1st time enjoying usj,"Everything is good to enjoy, attraction superb, show spectacular.. fortunately less people so i can enjoyed the park because no need to queue",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,My favorite place in Osaka,"This is officially my favorite place in Osaka. The theme parks, attractions and rides, the shows, and the food are all excellent! Highly recommended!","Written August 6, 2021"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,No repairs for Harry Potter wand,"One Star to get attention. We bought a Harry Potter interactive wand and shortly after buying it it stopped working. We read online that that Orlando and Hollywood Universal Studios will repair a broken wand no questions asked, so we took it back to the shop. However they refused and claimed once sold they will not accept returns or do repairs. The interactive wand is expensive since the point of it is less of the wand itself and more of paying so that you can interact with the magical surroundings. Needless to say this was disappointing and I don't understand why the Japan location would have a different policy than its US counterparts.","Written June 14, 2021"

Japan is one of the countries of art. The architectural relics from Tokyo to Osaka bring out the Japanese style. The local aspect focuses on the beautiful appearance. The dazzling gold and the differences also bring out the distinctive urban architecture. More regularity and prosperity The other side of Japan. Tokyo and Japan’s unique cuisines are very attractive for unforgettable memories. Personal opinions are provided for reference Starchan",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,値段が高い,too expensive and nothing special。i had to throw in the rubbish my bentou and i had to buy the expensive food of the park. This is crazy!,"Written April 5, 2021"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"smaller than the US counterparts, great experience, and good food.","Love USJ! There's something they do different than other parks. All the staff is very kind and the merchandise is quite unique to this location. Recommend for friends, family, and must ride the dinosaur coaster.","Written February 21, 2021"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great Place!,"We went to USJ without purchasing any tickets beforehand, it took us less than 5 mins to purchase tickets. We went last Oct 2019 (not 2020), it was Halloween season. The theme of the place was halloween inspired. The lights, decorations, even Hello Kitty was dressed in a sppoky outfit, at night zombies will chase you,

Side note: Don't bring outside food because our food got confiscated at the entrance :(",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Once is e ought.,"I buy the annual pass each year and I wonder why. You go 3 times, it becomes cost effective. I never want to go more than that in one year.","Written November 18, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Express Pass Recommended,"We bought our tickets through KKday for easy access via QRCode E-Ticket while we purchased our Express Passes direct from USJ's website as it was cheaper compared to packages sold from agencies. However, do note that the whole web page is in Japanese and would require and account and translation to complete the transaction.

Definitely a whole day or two would be required to complete all the attractions in the park with an express pass. We were in the park from opening till closing and although we purchased the Express 7, we did not get to complete 4-5 main attractions due to the queue.

We queued 90-105min for The Flying Dinosaur hence, it would be best to plan accordingly to fully utilized the time spent. Main attractions to visit would be The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Jurassic Park, Minion Park and Hollywood the Ride! Terminator 2 3-D attraction was presented in Japanese only to our dismay hence, we got bored halfway through it.

Would definitely come back again to experience Super Nintendo World in 2021! :D",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Super full day at Universal Studios Japan osaka,"This was for my sons 10th birthday and my wife is also a pretty big Harry Potter fan. So the The Wizarding World of Harry Potter was the main reason that we went but there was plenty of other things to do and see. The rides we enjoyed were:
Despicable Me Minion Mayhem, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey and Flight of the Hippogriff and Jurassic Park the ride (the last 2 were actual roller coaster rides, the other were 3D/4D rides). All of there were lots of fun but I prefer the actual rides to the 3D/4D rides. Make sure you get some Butterbeer - it tastes awesome. Also another tip is to go early or late for lunch as there can be a bit of a wait (also depending on where you go it can be a little expensive) Over all a fun filled, exhausting day that the whole family enjoyed",

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,They won't let you bring in water.,"Knowing how incredibly annoying japanese people can get when it comes to dumbly applying rules, I read them carefully in both English and Japanese the day before going to avoid any problem.
Alas, they still managed to find something to nitpick about in my bag : my bottle of water, which apparently was oversized (no joke -,-). So they took it and thanks to them I got a heatstroke. I contacted the customer service but they don't care. Great. Never going there again.","Written August 5, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Everyone was very Friendly,"We live in Kansai and were able to visit in July 2020 during the restricted entry for local residents. We went on a weekday and there were no lines or large crowds. Everyone of the USJ staff was very happy and friendly. It was remarkable and added to the fun experience. **TIP** Download the USJ app on Android or iPhone. The map feature is excellent, you can save favorites and there is real-time information about wait times for the attractions. The Harry Potter Journey was incredible. It did make me dizzy and nauseous afterwords however. Overall it was a very fun day and we were able to see/do everything we wanted in about 5 hours because there were no lines or wait times for any of the attractions or restaurants.","Written July 13, 2020"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Loved Every Corner of USJ,"My favorite part of my experience is the Harry Potter ride experience. but i think, every part that i visited i have enjoyed a lot. i got back being a kid again hahaha. Though you have to be hungry walking the entire area. it is worth all your time.","Written June 3, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,USJ is really fantastic!,"There are various zones such as Harry Poter, Minion, Spider-Man, Jaws and Jurassic Park, and there are so many rides available for various age groups. The most interesting ride for me was The Flying dinosaur, but the waiting line was really long, so I was sad. If you buy Express Pass, you don't have to line up, but it's expensive. Therefore, To wait less I recommend waiting in one person line even if you have a party. And I recommend you to go for popular attractions like Harry Potter first. It was so much fun that I wanted to go to osaka every time. If you go to Osaka, please go to Universal Studios:)","Written May 28, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,So much fun,"I went there in the late Morning and i spent the whole day there as its fun. There are different sections for different ages like the harry potter rides , the minion rides etc.","Written May 6, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"In between Hollywood and Orlando, but the lines are INSANE","We’re frequent visitors to the Hollywood and Orlando Universal Studios locations, and I would rank Osaka below Orlando and well above Hollywood.

As is the case with everywhere in Japan, the Osaka universal studios is extremely clean. The rides are solid to great, with the highlights being Flying Dinosaur and the Hollywood Dream ride. As a huge theme park fan, I can say unequivocally that the Flying Dinosaur is one of my favorite rides of all time. The Hollywood Dream ride isn’t a majorly thrilling rollercoaster, though it’s definitely fun and a really smooth ride.

Keep in mind, the lines for most rides are absolutely freaking ridiculous. There was a temporary VR Neon Genesis ride while we were there (it was mediocre, though I guess if you’re a fan of the cartoon then it would be cool), and the wait was almost four hours long.

As such, I HIGHLY suggest getting an Express pass. Be aware that it’s different than the pass at Universal Studios Hollywood, as you’re only able to choose between several bundles of rides whose lines you can cut. That said, it’s absolutely worth it and pretty much required if you want to ride more than a few rides.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Did not get through a lot with our kids in wet weather. Ok visit.,"On a weekday, took almost 5 & 7 year olds, arriving at 11amish. Bought tix at gate (had trouble online) which was quick (5 mins) and left the park at 7pm. Regretted not buying the express passes (for 3/5 rides) as we spent 45 mins + waiting for most rides and zig zagged the park a fair bit to try catch events at the times they were on.
Missed out on a fair bit even though we had a plan.
It also began to rain from around 3pm and never stopped so the fireworks and parade were cancelled with nothing to replace either except for a few actors (maybe 6) dressed in colourful outfits standing in a line waving at visitors. This is completely underwhelming and needs improvement.

The Cool Japan shows/attractions had a decent area and close to park entry but we didn’t visit as we had other priorities for our kids age interest.

Harry Potter land is amazing and looks so magical. Didn’t have timed entry in mid March. A definite highlight even though our kids haven’t yet read or watched any. Magical Nights light show was great. The Wand Studies was a waste of time unless you have it to waste and was definitely a cheesy push to send people through the wand shop which looked amazing but wand prices were bananas at 50 a pop.
Zipped through the castle due lack of time. Missed the ride due to long queue in rain and kids too small for roller coaster.

Kids loved the Water World performance

Sesame st 4D movie was great and the only movie we were able to catch due time/location

Minions and Spider-Man rides were excellent for all of us. Jurassic Park scared our almost 7 more than our younger kid as he hated the steep drop. Be prepared to get wet.

Disappointments:
-Queues were long for non peak time & minimal or no entertainment offered. Some shows/rides had time consuming pre show/ride sections which were just average and need reviewing
-It’s Japan so yes, Japanese is the language used but there is ample opportunity for spoken English or at least subtitles during all shows.
-Not enough characters sighted in park. Only saw about 5/6 of the Sesame St characters in the Hollywood area (I think) and that’s it! For the whole 8 hours we were there.
-Unlike Disneyland, staff do not give Universal Studio stickers out. You have to request them. Almost all have them so it’s crappy you have to ask. It’s also crappy that there are only a small selection. Disneyland nails this! and it helps keep the kids in queues a bit happier when they hand them out.
-Retail merch here was noticeably more expensive than Disney Tokyo a year prior. I expect high prices but I drew the line here as I felt it was a joke.
- a number of rides were closed for maintenance and then more due to the rain.
- many things closed around 5 pm, too many! With the rain and this, I found the park quite boring and looked forward to leaving but decided to swing by Muppet land where we managed to get on 3 rides in one hour. This area is great for under 5s but in saying that our almost 7 enjoyed it too.

In summary: visited La Universal 10yrs ahi and that was great. This time, with kids, it was a good but a number of disappointments for what it cost (time & $) ,too many things closed, not as exciting or magical as Disney.","Written March 4, 2020"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great tour,"If you love theme park, we highly recommend to visit Universal Studios. The crowd is not as important as in Disneyland in Tokyo if even if it was during a weekend in the summer. The park is quite big so one whole day is the minimum, and Harry Potter should be the first attraction to be visited since it is quickly full. People are very helpful and the visitors are very polite (queues are always respected), which makes your day way more enjoyable.

Thé only big problem we went through was when we booked through Tripadvisor that cancelled a few days before our weekend our tickets without explanations, we had to buy in a hurry a few days prior to our weekend.","Written February 29, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Surely this is the happiest place on earth!,"We got the day and a half pass and only just got to see all we wanted during this crowd free virus affected period. I can’t ride because of injuries and can be pretty grumpy but the cheerfulness here is catching! I was waving to everyone before I even knew what I was doing and chatted to lots of lovely people in the well behaved queues. My family had an amazing time at this spotlessly clean, crazy organised fun park! Harry Potter fans will especially love the Wizarding World, the night illuminations this month were breathtaking.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,USJ is so much fun,"I've been to USJ three time with my family already. We just love this place! It's so much fun. Our favourites are Harry Potter, Jaws, Waterworld, Jurassic World, Terminator, Spiderman, and more. Only downside of course are the long lines. Getting fast pass is very expensive especially for a family of four. So we put up with the waiting and can't always get in all the rides that we want to in a single day. That's why we have been here 3 different times!","Written March 19, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,The best theme park ever 🎢🎢🎢,"The rides where great and the Spiderman ride is definitely good for anyone (adult or child ) great area for your kids and the Harry potter ride is a must do though make sure to pay extra for fast tracks on the jaws , Harry potter rides , Spiderman and jurrasic park because the queen's can get very long . The food is amazing serving western and Japanese food and definitely try the matcha ice cream but the best part is the parade but if you want to get to the subway station quicker and go to the gift shop miss out the last bit of the parade as it can get quite claustrophobic in the shop or subway.

This is the best theme park ever and a must do for Osaka","Written March 17, 2020"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,So much FUN !,"Awesome ride especially Harry Potter ride, dinasour ride and Hollywood Dream ride. I went there during Holloween and joined their Holloween party until 12am. So fun and awesomeness is on another level. Also being chased by Zombies is no joke. I screamed and laughed so hard while trying to rescue myself. The memories is unforgettable and it cheers me up whenever I feel down.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Awesome! No regrets with the 1.5 days tix,"After in depth research/reviews, we bought tickets on a Monday for 1.5 days. Voila! we managed to cover everything even though it was absolutely crowded.
And Fyi, 95% of the language either spoken by the staff or ride/show related were all in Japanese. Bits of Harry Potter were in English and oh thank God...”Sing” was in English and it was so much fun. Some staff do understand and speak basic English though I must say all of them were really very polite and looked very happy doing their job so that was very welcoming.
But I must warn you guys about the intro to the Terminator attraction. The lady in red took too long, tried to get the crowd in the mood but it was 100% in Japanese so for us it came across as boring and never ending.
The rest of the attractions were just like any other Universal Studios...amazing. Butter beer was a nice surprise. Toilets were pleasantly clean all day. There were different sized/priced storage lockers upfront which were convenient.
If you’re planning to watch the final show, staff will go all out to keep the walkway/seating in check. You’d have to sit within the road/garden site so head there earlier if you want a good spot. Only the Express pass will get you a seat on the platform.
The final Parade took quite some time to finish but worth the time, it was magical. I found the merchandise quite pricy then again everything in Japan is quite pricy.","Written February 16, 2020"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Royal studio pass,"We five intended to visit Univeral studio Japan on January 2nd. We knew that there would be very crowded so we would like to make sure that we could enjoy our rides without waiting very long.

We bought 5 Royal Studio Pass via Govoyagin website. Firstly we couldn’t book. So we sent an e-mail directly to them. They got back to us and asked for our airplane tickets and hotel confirmation. After that they sent us an e-mail with a link to book the pass. It was pre-paid. And when we checked in at our hotel, our 5 Royal Studio Pass wrist bands were there. Very professional.

These wrist bands gave us the most convenient way to enjoy USJ. We didn’t have to wait at all. There would be some rides that we had to go during the period of time and only one time for fast track such as Harry Potter,Minion etc. The rest we could go as many times as we wanted like a fast track eg. Jaws, Spider man etc.

Turkey legs were delicious here. We had a fun time.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Never too young!!!,My husband and I are in our 50s and we thoroughly enjoyed universal studios. We managed to do most of the rides with no ill effects. Fabulous day out for any age. I would highly recommend the Harry Potter ride,"Written February 12, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Awesome day out,Always a great place to go with the family. Some rides can be a bit of a wait but there is always something to do!,"Written February 12, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,So much fun!,"Having visited a couple other Universal Studios, I was a bit worried that this experience would be same old same old but it was not! We visited during Cool Japan and had so much fun. There are lots of adorable merchandise to browse and buy and the rides are a little more intense as compared to those in the United States. Sure everything is in Japanese but we already expected that. You can read the 'ride sypnosis' on USJ's website before going if it bothers you.

Tip: Get in line for the Attack on Titans 4D ride when the park opens. It's worth the wait and so popular they close the ride after lunch time. It was hands down the best ride in the park.","Written February 10, 2020"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"We went on WED and THURS (JAN 2020), very little crowd (and no Express Pass)","We bought tickets for 2 days (because we knew we will spend long time shopping and applying for tourist refund). 1st day was on 29th JAN 2020, and the next day 30th JAN. We got there at around 8:20 and 8:30 am and on both days we ended up quite close to the entrance when we arrived.

The park opened at 8:45 (eventhough it listed the to open at 9am). Since there was a ""Cool Japan"" event, our first priority was to ride the Attack on titan. Eventhough the queue listed at 45 mins, we got on the ride after about 20-25mins. It was a really cool indoor roller coaster ride with VR. This turned out to be the best decision because throughout the day the line for this were consistently 100-110mins. We went to Minion Meyham next with very little wait (20 mins) but it was really disappointing. Maybe more for kids. Minions Ray sliders was next and it was surprisingly good. Then we immidiately went for Harry potter ride and IT WAS AMAZING!!! This is the best ride I have ridden in awhile! The wait for this was about 45 mins (however we went in after 30 mins.) I noticed the listed wait times are often Over estimated. We did not go on the 2 roller coasters (Dinasour and Hollywood Dream) because we were more excited for the Harry Potter world. The ButterBeer is a MUST! we paid 650yen for it. Also, there is a line in HP world which seemed to lead nowhere....this is actually the line into the wand magic show. We went in and WE WERE PICKED TO GET A MAGIC WAND! WOW! However eventhough we won, the wand is NOT FREE and costs 4900 yen. With the wand you can go around the park and test your magic spells (like opening a locked door, lighting a fire lamp ect.) - gimicky if you ask me.

For lunch we ate at the 3 broomsticks - be warned, it was very expensive although very very delicious. I ordered the Sheperds pie - incredibly good! But the Fish and chips were salty! On the 2nd day we ate at The Dragon's Pearl - disappointing - Dont waste your money here!!! On both days we ate dinner at universal City walk mall (just outside Universal after we have exited the park). we ate pasta at Romaken (just beside matsumoto kiyoshi) - highly recommended and cheaper than eating inside USJ too.

Anyways, other rides we went on were Spiderman (really good), Terminator (just another 3-d show), Jaws( quite boring) and some kids rides (Elmos skateboard - which was surprisingly good, Flying Snoopy and Moopy's ballon). We went to ALmost all the shows, The SHrek 3-D and the Sing on Tour were really good! Water world (in Japanese so we did not understand) and BAckdraft were okay. I also enjoyed Monster's Rock and Roll show, but I have a feeling the japanese audiences did not - maybe because they sang mostly 80s english songs which I enjoyed very much!

But highlight of the trip was the light show at Harry potter world. This show is incredible and Not to be missed! The night parade was just okay - Pale in comparison with Disney's night parade.

The 2nd day we went on the Harry potter ride 3 MORE TIMES!!!! Yeah, we loved it that much! It was really impressive! And each time we did not was wait more than 20 minutes. Towards end of the day at around 6pm , we went on the ride again and had no wait at all because everybody were waiting at outside the castle to watch the light show. We also finished our shopping at around 4pm and at the time, the line for the tourist refund were really short!!! So, my advice is do your shopping early and get the tourist refund done early - as it gets really crowded at night.

We glad we came on wed and thurs. There were not many crowds at all. most rides had only 20-30 mins wait except the flying Dinosaur and hollywood dream and even that they were consistently 55-60 mins max everytime i checked. I saw some people buying express passes and cant help to think they just wasted their money on that day.","Written February 9, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,The staff were so friendly & happy,"If I was rating just the park I would of given a 4 star but due to the staff all being fantastic it’s gone up to a 5

The actual park is not the biggest and several rides are very dated now and need changing eg .... Back draft ride ... I’m 40 and even I don’t remember when that film came out or what’s it was about .... apart from fire lol
Terminator 2 ride was very slow and dragged , jaws classic ride can’t fault it , Spider-Man great , The pterodactyl ride in Jurassic Park was amazing and Harry Potter world didn’t disappoint

The late night parade was good and great effects

We went on Feb on a week day and the Qs were only half hr max so no issues there

Would recommend for a day out lots of fun and the staff were all fantastic",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,USJ trip,"Nice place to be there but there was so many people. If you intend to play, its best to buy the fast lane tickets so that you can enjoy it. I didn't have the time to enter bcos of so many people there & the queue was terrible.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Fun Place For Everyone!,"We visited on New Year's Eve and bought a pass for the day and the party that followed. The park is definitely similar to the US equivalents but a fun place to be and high quality! We went on the Jaws ride and it was fun. Of course it is all in Japanese but that is fine. After all you are in Japan. The Back Draft experience was fun for us but there is a lot of fire so if you have small children it may not be for you. Spiderman was very fun. Terminator 2 was okay but Spiderman is better if you have to make a choice. Sing the musical was okay but more so for kids. The Harry Potter ride was really fun but a lot of motion. My stomach was a little queasy but only for a short time. Great ride overall. Be sure that you understand whether the ride is open or not, We ignored a sign (or missed it) that said it was only a castle walk through and we waited in line a long time only to have no ride. We went later and it was outstanding! It would be nice if they had a fly over ride that had a big screen overview of Japan like California Disney has but alas, there is not one. Nice park and lots of good restaurant choices there as well. Expect Universal prices in the stores, but the restaurants were not overpriced as far as we were concerned. Of course we do not have children.","Written February 7, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Fun Way To Spend New Year's!,"We bought a ticket to the park so we could go during the day for a bit and then we left when they closed the park for an hour and rentered with the party entry ticket. Fun to walk around and see all the decorations for Christmas. The live entertainment was fun to watch from a distance but we did not stand in that area for very long as we wanted to experience the park.
It was cold and crowded, but we were dressed for it. I did buy a Jaws Hat and would have liked to have the royalties on the hats as they sold thousands of them! They do keep your head warm!
It was crowded but we worked through the crowds and got on the rides that we wanted to. The Minions and Harry Potter was where the big crowds were. The fireworks were fun and it was great that the park was open all night! Overall we had a great time. We had my niece who is 27 so 3 adults. Glad we went in during the day and had fun at night! Only giitch was the tight crowd pushing and shoving toward Harry Potter when the fireworks were over. We enjoyed it!",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"The Best of 3 Worlds - East, West and Magic!","It's not just western movie themed. If you're lucky, you might encounter Anime-themed attractions (sadly seasonal). Check their website for anime special rides and plan accordingly. You'll definitely enjoy Harry Potter. In fact, I suggest you book for 2 days, 1 for just Harry Potter and another for the rest of Universal.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Fabulous,"The first thing caught my eyes is the crystal festival. The field of Harry Potter is indeed sensational. But what impression last in my mind is the sense of humour that staffs have - little baby dinosaur in his unique babyseat and it's ""alive"" like his mum .......l mean ""vivid""! Very creative! Highly recommended!",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Osaka USJ - shockingly poor value for money !,"Osaka USJ - shockingly poor value for money !
You will probably regret this.

We regrettably paid for express 4 passes & express 7 had sold out 15 mins into opening time. But It was a complete waste (with a one-day studio pass) of over $500AUD! For 2 anyway.

Let’s face it Japan is very crowded & due to this quite regimented. USJ has ineffective management & poor staff supervision, I saw none.
The ride staff were actually quite rude often (I know right RUDE STAFF at a UNIVERSAL STUDIOS!) but it was far worse than just this, they were slow disengaged & unmotivated, this is totally unacceptable. I saw many groups of mostly young girl staff wandering around the park like they were guests, I mean with 70-120 min wait times for some rides & people queueing 30mins-45mins for a pretzel or churo…THIS IS SHOCKINGLY BAD!

USJ STAFF: YOUR JOB IS TO SERVE THE GUESTS AS FAST & FRIENDLY AS YOU CAN! Or be sacked!

I recommend Westerners to STAY AWAY! You won't like this. There is little value placed on your freedom here, it’s a real circus and not in a good way! park management obviously failing to put any reasonable limits on how many attendees they admit to the park.
It was not a casual fun experience. It was like being marched around in a prison camp!
All the above has a de-valuation effect in my opinion, damaging the historically great entertainment based name of Universal Studios USA

The food in the outlets, which could have saved them, absolutely did not!
We had a burger at Mels Diner early before lunch - why would an attraction making such huge profits skimp on the food – This was nothing like what you might get at a real American diner.

We turned to Alcohol (Extortion like prices) to cover up how we were feeling about how bad this was.

I recommend to Universal Studios America to undertake an assessment here, it’s no good if a foreign operator is wrecking your brand! Maybe bring is a consultant from the Singapore USS.

I’ve been to all the Disney Parks in Japan multiple times & recommend you choose Disneyland & Disneysea Tokyo Bay – its far superior to this atrocious greedy wrecking ball to western values.
There is nothing fun about this claustrophobic regimented experience. UGH!

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Great for families, be prepared to walk and have fun","Went there early December, the lines were supposedly not as long as expected but it was cold.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Amazing entertainment for all ages!,"We regret not spending more than a day in USJ, as there were a lot to discover here that we were not able to. Highly recommended to go for 2 days the least, or buy an express pass so that you do not have to line up and spend a minimum of 1.5 hours in line with the best rides that they have here (Harry Potter, Minions, etc). Prices are just like the western universal studios, but hey, they will milk you out as much as possible, as expected. Money grabbing dudes as they even ask for more money to have the best seat in the parade, which actually you can avoid paying by just being there earlier. We enjoyed wasting our money here, so money well spent. ;-) Kids were ecstatic!",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,number one must visit park,"I am proud to say I am happy I put visiting USJ as the activity for my first day in OSAKA. I bought the tickets online and got an e-ticket form (which ease me from printing and folding papers in my bag). My sister and I arrived in front of the gate by 08.50 using JR Haruka Limitted Express. (you can buy the JR 5 days pass in Klook with a good deal, i'll write about this in another page) Anyways, the queue was long for a low season day. (FRI 10 jan 2020) but we managed to get through the security bag check after 20 minutes. Visitors are not allowed to bring selfie sticks, they were asked to keep them in a locker. Once inside, we directly ran to the WWOHP. Oh yeah make sure you wear comfortable shoes for many walks. The WWOHP is less crowded in the morning and since we did not buy the express pass or Harry potter timed ticket pass (we just have the regular ticket and with great planning it is more than enough). We rushed to queue for the Forbidden Journey ride! Lucky us we only queue for 45 mins! This ride is a must, though we've played this in Hollywood, we play it one more time in Japan. Then after the ride, we took pictures and drink the famous butter beer. Japan offers hot butterbeer during cold seasons and this tastes better!
When the visitors flooded the WWOHP area, we moved to Amityville and ride the one and only Jaws experience in Japan! This is fun even though we had no idea of the Japanese drama. Then we had lunch at Three broomsticks around 11.45 and it's starting to get full, but we found a nice spot outside. Lunch was magical with the Hogwarts Castle view. I got a nice shot from the outdoor area. Then to digest our food, we do the Harry Potter castle walk. Afterwards, we queue for the (must ride) Pterodactyls in the Jurasic world. Then there's the amazing spiderman ride which is suitable for all age. We skipped all of the shows for we've seen a lot of them in the other Universal Studios. Sadly one of the big ride (the one rollercoaster which were pulled backwards) were under maintenance and we cannot ride it.
We did not wait for the parade at night, for we have another itinerary waiting, but by 16.00 we've bought our last souvenirs and say goodbye to USJ.
Skipped minion and all the shows for kids.
We took a lot of pictures and enjoyed more of the vibes there!
The regular tickets works best when you planned everything well.
See you another day USJ!
Meet sanrio characters and other famous characters
Gotta say Japan has a lot of characters posing for pictures. We met all of elmo's friends, minions and gru, and of course Hello kitty and marilyn monroe.
The employees are super nice and kind, they won't hesitate taking pics for you!
Visit Olivander's wand shop in the morning, before the lines are long.

There's a lot of restaurants and cafes in front of the gate. Just outside the train station and before the USJ main gate.
If you use JR pass, stop at Universal City station, once you get off just walk to the left and voila you're there!",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Nice to be here and feeling crazy,"Veryy nice to be here and everyone's dream world .
Feel crazy when met a snoopy, sesame street,driving Spiderman Race and Harry Potter",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Different style of amusement park,"I've visit disneyland and disney sea last with my family..and have a great time there..while universal from my personnal point of view is giving a different taste. Enter this park just loke you've been taken to the hollywood side since so many ride which related with the hollywood movies however the explanation is in japanese..

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Fun and Friendly Staff,"This is second visit to Universal Studios Japan because of 'Harry Potter'. Bought the Universal Express Pass Package which was quite expensive to avoid the approximately 2 hours queuing for several attraction/rides. The restaurants good food, especially the Finnegan Bar & Grill.","Written January 20, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,not great value for money,"As a family with 2 teenagers, we visited USJ. While we got the 15 minute early entry, we were done just after 2pm. There are about 4 main rides and Harry Potter world. There is no much after that. For the price that we paid for the tickets, I did not find this to be good value.","Written January 19, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Incredibly friendly staff!!,"We had a super fun day exploring the park, and found the staff so so friendly, helpful and enthusiastic. We treated ourselves to an express pass which was very expensive but it was nice to skip the queue on a few key rides. Not sure you’d need it In low season though.","Written January 18, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Lots of fun,"Our 11 and 8 year olds picked this cos of Harry Porter and it was worth it. I personally am not a roller coaster fan but by the end of the one day, I must admit it was lots of fun. Plenty of screams and adventures and would advise the purchase of express pass unless you have lots of time to sit in the queues","Written January 17, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Mixed opinions,"Let's start that this park is quite different from the one I visited in Orlando, Florida. There are some rides built only there and some are missing. Especially the ride on the pterodactyl tail.
The local ride, Attack on Titans, unfortunately, was closed and we couldn't do it. There is another huge ride which is closed as well.
First tip: get to the park from Monday to Thursday. Check if no holidays are happening in country. This will save you from overcrowding.
Huge tip: should you plan not to get express pass I highly recommend choosing to go via solo lanes. Way faster, ignores 2 hour waiting time. The only negative is the one cannot sit next to their friends/family. It is possible to ask at the ride if they have solo queues or check on booklets (found on internet or handed out at the entrance). As a result, we manneged to do almost all major rides without waiting ages.
How to get there? There is a designated JR train connected to main train lines of Osaka. In stations there are various signs indicating which station to take. Don't worry to ask staff, very helpful and resourceful. From Nararel hostel it took us 30mins to get there.
The only drawback of the park are prices. Some prices of the place are skyrocketing. The wands start from 4200 yens which is more then a half of ticket. Food is fresh and decent, no complaints here.
Almost forgot, terminator 3d show is my personal sleeper. Even if you don't understand Japanese it is rather easy to follow the action. I have never seen that footage with original actors from the franchise. Well worth for anyone.
In sum, it was a well spent time full of surprises, great March, tears and 3 rides on HP castle. Despite high prices and sometimes overcrowded days, I highly recommend this park for a visit for families, couples or solo travellers",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Very good!!!,Very good. We are planning to go for the second time in this japan trip. Trust me this is worth the money and time!,"Written January 16, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Extremely expensive for not a lot of rides,At $800 (Australian) I expected more rides. We paid for the express pass 4 and in total used 11 rides / shows over 8 hours. A lot of the shows like Jaws and Backdraft were in Japanese so pretty much a waste of time. This was all the rides possible (other than very young kiddie rides) and included the Flying Dinosaur twice. We have kids aged 10 and 12. They loved it but we felt ripped off. The food was outrageously priced - we spent $55 (!) on popcorn which included a plastic minion holder ($45 with popcorn plus one refill an extra $10) one ice cream sundae ($12) looked big enough for two to share but was a small cup inside a large bucket to trick you into thinking it had more in it. All in all left starving and feeling ripped off.,"Written January 16, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Didn’t need Express pass in witner,We didn’t mind waiting for the rides as the queues weren’t too bad. The best rides were the Harry Potter school and the Jurassic park flying roller coaster. Waterworld show was awesome but Backdraft was not worth the wait. Wish we’d seen the little Japanese restaurant near San Fransisco instead of all the cheap fast food options. We left on a high! Such a great day!,
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Christmas at Hogwarts,"Christmas in Tokyo had served up plenty of carols and Christmas cheer, but I’d missed out on a traditional Christmas lunch. I was at KFC that day (yep, it’s a thing; look it up). But it felt super Christmassy at Hogsmeade – cold weather, wreaths, hot butter beer - and a full, traditional Christmas meal, followed by treacle pudding at The Three Broomsticks! Merry Christmas, Harry.","Written January 15, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Christmas Day treat,Went here as a family of 4 for Christmas Day. We Pre bought royal vip fastpass. Very expensive but well worth it. We had timed entry to the top rides and only waited a few minutes to ride when the actual queues were 2 hours long!!! Very festively decorated. We had turkey dinner at the broomsticks all very nice. We had a great Christmas,
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Good fun visit,"Best to go earlier in the morning to avoid the long lines of the rides. The Harry Potter is a must of course to visit. The line was a challenge, for such a quick experience. Overall it was fun to go to USJ","Written January 15, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Adventure,Been here several time already. Always greeted with crowded people. A must place to be also when in Osaka,"Written January 13, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Don't go during Holidays,"We went there on New Year's day & it was not a wise choice.

The park itself is OK - good layout, accessible, good variety of rides and entertainment. But we didn't get to fully appreciate it because of the thick crowd, long queue and limited operation hours.

Go on off-peak, never during Holidays.","Written January 11, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Definitely get an express pass and visit in off oeak,"We were there at 8:30am and the lines were okay for an off peak day. The problem was that unlike Singapore, they bag check everyone. So once the doors opened, it was another 30mins to get in. Unfortunately the Hollywood section was closed which was really disappointing. The lines were insane - even on an off peak day when the park was at 15% capacity lines were still over an hour. We had a fast pass 4 and that was worth it, the rides we used it on had 60-70min lines and we lined up for less than 10mins each time.

There are minimal places to sit down around the park and I got told off quite a few times by staff for sitting on a garden bed edge or on a curb due to the lack of seating. I have an injury so the lack of seating was a real issue for me.

Be aware everything is in Japanese - none of the rides or 3D sections have any English parts. This means terminator, Harry Potter, backdraft, Spider-Man and jaws have NO ENGLISH at all so you have to just enjoy the ride with no idea what’s actually being said.

It was good fun for a day but at close to $200 AUD each for entry and a fast pass, the Singapore one is much better.","Written January 9, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Enjoyable - one of the better amusement parks,"Highly recommend Prebooking express tickets if you can afford. Very expensive and they were sold out anyway when we bought tickets at the gate. So we had to wait in line like all the other commoners.

Unfortunately we went during Christmas/new year so children were on school holidays. The good thing was that the lines were shorter than they were labelled. 40 minute waits were usually 20.

The bad thing was there was no wifi in the park so I couldn’t message my husband. Which meant we had to wait for each other to finish a ride with one of our kids before coming back and going to another ride (one child was too scared to go on roller coasters.. or anything really). So we didn’t get to go on every ride we wanted to.

The main roller coaster in Jurassic Park had a huge 75 minute wait so we decided to sacrifice that one. It looked amazing though. Hanging from the harness in a flying kind of position.

My favourite ride was the Space Fantasy. I think it could be my favourite ride ever actually. Zipping around the universe and taking in the sights of Saturn and other planets was so fun! Something beautiful to look at whilst simultaneously hurtling around and screaming with joy made it very memorable.

Would not recommend going to the 3D/4D shows if you can’t understand Japanese. They don’t have translation and we just stood there wondering how to escape because we had such limited precious time (it wasn’t possible to leave because we were standing in the middle of a large crowd).","Written January 7, 2020"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Enjoyed End of Year 2019 Here, will come back given the chance","Went here on 31 Dec 2019, family trip with 2 small children (8&5).

As any major tourist attraction in high season, it is very crowded. Everything from entrance, rides, restaurants and toilets needs queue.

As a very large park, USJ managed well with the crowds. But unfortunately is very tiring to get from one place to another.

We entered and went directly to Harry Potter ride inside the Hogwarts castle. As a huge fan, almost all of the things in the HP world brings a smile to my face (but butterbeer is overrated to my muggle taste).

Next to Jurassic Park, had lunch which is expensive and tasted average, but no other option. My wife who is an adrenaline junkie loves the Flying Dinosaur. Using single line, we didn’t wait too long for her. While waiting, the kids enjoyed My Friend Dinosaur parade. Then we all went for Jurassic Park the ride and got a little bit wet and cold (winter, duh).

After Jurassic, went to Snoopy area, and queue to flying snoopy, but as the Express pass holder entered and entered the line, the reguler line didn’t move at all. We then gave up for the flying snoopy and went indoor for the snoopy roller coaster, a little queue there. My little boy enjoyed Elmo’s car. Then we went up the carousell but after a 10 mins delay, they announced that it was broken and we were asked to dismount.

Then we went to watch SING theatre, quite entertaining and a good rest as it is sitting down for around 10 mins.

Unfortunately we just found out that on that day, the park closed at 5. We misread the info that the park is open for 26 hours. Indeed it is open till midnight (fireworks show) but after 5PM, you will need another ticket to enjoy the park after hours.

So after finding out that the park is closing, we only got the chance to ride one more which is Minions Race, just a spinning ride.

Overall, the park is very enjoyable eventhough crowded. All of the staff is very friendly and making the guest experience very enjoyable.

Recommended for everyone, and if given the chance I will come back again with my family as we only rode less that 25% of all of the rides.",

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Hot summer day at USJ,Got to get there early before the park open. Japanese are crazy about the amusement park too. So there will be a long line at the entrance. The Harry Potter section does not require special admission so you can go in. But super long line for the line. At least an hour or more. It is very tiring to go during summer time. The weather is hot and th Elaine is long. Be prepared to suffer😂,
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great Family Entertainment,"Great for family with kids, outing with friends or couples ..

All good, except for it’s quite costly.

Good late afternoons and stay till closing at 2130pm. Less people, shorter queues, and enjoy all the rides and games without the fuss",

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Lots of fun rides,"Visited USJ on a Wednesday where the season is marked as 'A' and without the Express pass.

Parked is crowded but we managed to try most of the must try rides. During our visit, the waiting time ranges between 45mins to 95mins each.

Rating from us for the rides we tried:
1) Flying dinosaur
2) Hollywood backdrop (must do the backwards ride)
3) Despicable Me Minion Mayhem
4) Spider-Man 4K3D ride
5) Harry Porter - Flight of Hippogriff","Written December 22, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,It's Universal Studios - but in Japan!,"Very weird coming here as it is SO similar to the one in Hollywood, minus the studio tour of course! But the whole feel of the place, and many of the rides and attractions, are exactly the same. We went because a niece is performing in one of the live shows, but in fact had a good day all round! The shows are brilliant and the rides we went on were also excellent. But Hogwarts as an area was the best part of the day! It just looks and feels as you would imagine it would do.
There are quite a few food options on the park; we had pizza for lunch, which was surprisingly good, and later on popped into the diner for drinks. Neither was ridiculously expensive given that you are in a theme park so are a captive clientele.
Getting to USJ is pretty straightforward on the Osaka subway and local train line, with just a couple of minutes' walk, clearly signposted, when you leave the station.","Written December 22, 2019"

Amazing rides ... great food options ... super clean

Lots of walking ...

The park is magical , the attention to detail is beyond perfection .. the rides are different from
The other universals visited they seem longer and are more enjoyable .
Only negative criticism is that
The introductions to some rides like backdraft and the Minions is tooooo long before the rides start .. it seems like a delaying tactic to make it seem like u started the ride but its still another 10
minutes to the start of the ride and this is AFTER you get into
The ride ... i am not
Not talking about the queues before you start the ride .

But that said i LOVED the park loved the rides and will
Return ...loves the caramel
Popcorn .
Fast passes can be purchased with different options depending on which rides appeal to you ... worth it although very expensive . Most rides have the option of single riders which move very fast and beat the queues.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"A long, fun filled family day.","Purchased entry tickets plus express 4 from Klook for 2A, 2C (8 & 10) as the only day we could attend was a Sunday. Not cheap! Surprisingly, the waits for rides didn't exceed an hour but our express pass certainly helped when we were tired at the end of the day. Arrived 30 mins before opening and left 30 mins before close and we didnt do all the rides.
Kids loved Jaws (did it twice), Harry Potter, Spiderman, Terminator, with most enjoyable and memorable moments going to Jurassic ride (be warned - if you are in the front - you WILL get wet!) We didnt do rollercoasters due to both waits and lack of interest.
A couple of rides/ experiences are lost due to the language such as Backdraft and Minions. Waterworld was action packed and even without speaking Japanese were were able to still enjoy in the pre-show activities thanks to the great actors.
Buying a wand and casting spells, watching stage shows throughout USJ and soaking up the atmosphere all made for a fun family day.
We found although the food looked amazing, didnt really taste that great and we craved a decent meal by the end of the day.","Written December 19, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,A fun day at USJ,"We traveled by train to the Universal Studios from Shin Osaka. It required two changes (from one line to another) but not too difficult to navigate.

It was a Friday on our visit and the park was full of school children in uniform.

We had purchased the tickets online and also the express pass which saved us some time especially for the popular rides.

We took the forbidden ride in Harry Potter, the Jaws boat cruise and the Despicable Minions. These are not the scary rides but all fun and enjoyable.

One disappointing fact is that the movies and explanations were all in Japanese without English subtitles. Given the volume of International tourists I would expect the park to provide English subtitles for the benefit of non Japanese speakers.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Good Code A Day without Express Pass,"We bought our tickets online from Klook for Code A week and the tickets are emailed to us and we just printed the tickets directly. Do not resize the tix. QR code is scanned at entry.
We arrived at 8.30am and park opened at 9.30am. We ran to Harry Potter for our 1st ride. I think it is better to do Flying Dinosaur as 1st ride and then go to Harry Potter for picture taking. You may ride Harry Potter after 7pm with no wait at all. On average, Flying Dino has a 100min wait. Maybe it is due to the fact that it was closed for 1-2 hrs in the late morning. All other rides were a wait of 15min to 30min. Minion is 45min but i think it was due to the silly introduction which I almost drifted off to wonderland. We didnt watch any show since it was in Japanese. In between we had more than 2hrs of rest for lunch and dinner and after 2nd ride of Harry Potter after 7pm, we had more than 2 hrs of free time for shopping! We did sit all rides.
A family of 7 bought the 7 express passes and told us it was truly a waste of money as the wait wasn't long. However you may check if other weeks require express passes.","Written December 17, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great visit for families,"We had an extra day in Osaka and decided to visit Universal studios with our 7 year old. It is highly recommended to buy entrance tickets ahead of time (available here on trip advisor) and show up at least 30min before opening to take advantage of the first 30 min when waiting time is low. We bought the 4 ride express pass at the gate and while it saved us about 30 per ride on a rainy Monday in December I believe this is a must for weekend visitors during peak season. Harry Potter ride and experience was great and very impressive, we also enjoyed the minions and Spider-Man as well as the traditional roller coasters.","Written December 15, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,One of the best theme parks in Asia,"Be sure to arrive early in the park as the lines go very long in the middle of the day. For foreigners it is best to buy the 1.5 day pass so you can explore the park more and take many pictures. Also it is advise to eat first before entering the park because the food is quite expensive inside if you are on the budget. Be sure not to miss the night parade and ride Hollywood dreams, flying dinosaur, and Harry Potter.",

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Though packed but queue is fast moving,"Visited USJ in late November. I was contemplating whether to buy fast pass. However, due to the high cost, i have decided to give up the idea.
Arrived USJ before it opened. Waited outside for almost an hr before we are allowed in. Once in, we proceeded to the popular rides first. To our surprise, though there's queue, we did not wait long to get on the rides. On average, we waited for an hour or less to get on the rides.","Written December 14, 2019"

Some attractions are alright e.g Hollywood wonderland, Harry Potter castle, Amazing Spiderman etc, the rest was ok, no surprised. Food are boring yet expensive and long queue as any Uni Studios e.g. burger, pizza, fried chicken rice etc. If you were first timer visiting Uni studio, you might be having lots of fun, but if you have visited other Uni studio, then Dun expect too high","Written December 12, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great fun,I had a lot of fun here. Although some shows were hard to follow as they were in Japanese (as can be expected) I purchased the express pass which included 4 rides. I went on a Tuesday and probably the only ride that helped having the express was the Flying Dinosaur ride. Most others it only took a max of 15 mins to get through. So it probably wasn’t worth the extra $$.,"Written December 11, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Fun for all the family,"We had 3 kids under 9 youngest being 6mths. All the kids had fun, and there were so many things for them to do. Great rides for the older kids as well as those thrill seeking older ones. We didn't get to go on all the rides partly due to kids, but also due to some wait times, so if you are going best to go mid week (we went on a Monday) or get a fast pass, its basically the same cost as admission but if you only get to do it once, you wont want to be standing around in ques and miss shows etc. But the atmosphere there is buzzing, so you really get into it.","Written December 10, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Time to be a kid again!,"What more can I say...it's a magical place to be! We were fortunate to come when there not too many people.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,A great day out,"We arrived at 9.30am (normal entry opening time) the entry was jam packed and people were everywhere, but the staff were efficient and lovely. I would recommend going to Lawsons' just after getting of the train to grab snacks and lunch as they have a great variety which is fresh and healthy but also at a great price.
We headed straight to Harry Potter and were able to get on the rides there within 30 minutes each. The trip around the studio was fun however, line up/queue times were what we spend the bulk of the day doing. If you can afford it get the express pass available. You could actually spend a couple of days here if you have the time. We all agreed that the best ride was Hollywood Dream the ride, this also goes backwards but had an extended wait time.
All in all a great day.",

A lot of ride is challenging for adult than disneyland. Before you come check the schedule carefully. May be because we don’t come on peak day the park close earlier and there’s no night parade. They only have christmas show not parade which make me feel dissapointed at this point.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Timing is Everything,"Before coming, I had read the reviews about crowds and was expecting the worst. To my surprise, although busy, it wasn’t “out of control”.

We were here on a Thursday in early December - the estimated crowd (google USJ Crowd Calendar) forecast 17,000. Queues for the popular rides were around 1hr though we went as singles which typically meant 10-20min waits.

Harry Potter was the highlight with the rides and “streets” having a very authentic integrated feel.

The Flying Dinosaur was the definite thrill ride, being both long and terrifying.

One negative is that some “rides” are only in Japanese. For Jaws that didn’t really matter, but Backdraft lost a lot of impact. Most major attractions that we visited, the language didn’t matter or they did dual language or sub titles.

You can’t leave and re enter so you have to buy food there (not allowed to bring in?). Food was ok but expensive as you might expect.","Written December 5, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Birthday visit!,"We took my sister for her birthday and it was the best birthday ever! You can get a birthday sticker from any staff member in the shops and when staff see you wearing it, they wish you a happy birthday! All staff, in the street, at rides, at shops and even serving staff in restaurants (they list it as an item on the receipt so when you collect your food, all the staff know).

It rained a bit while we were there which kinda sucked but it wasn't heavy rain so it's didn't stop any rides or shows.

If you want to make sure to get on every ride, you should definitely buy the Universal Express Pass (you can buy tickets online even if you don't live in Japan, you just need a credit card). The queues for most rides are in excess of 120mins at any time of day. Express Pass will have you on the ride in less than 15 minutes.

Best rides to experience: The Flying Dinosaur (roller-coaster), Hollywood Dream (roller-coaster) , Spiderman (4D moving cart on a track) and Harry Potter Forbidden Journey (4D moving chair on a track).

Merchandise is far more expensive than other theme parks in Japan (such as Disney). But it's very good quality in most cases. You can get very cool light up goods for the night time, unique goods exclusive to the park and many fun headbands and hats to show your appreciation for characters.

The food is very yum, we really enjoyed eating at the Three Broomsticks in the Harry Potter area. It was very western cuisine such at pot pies, salads, whole corn on the cob, chicken with mashed potatoes etc. Felt a lot like being a student at Hogwarts for sure! And of course, during winter the hot butterbeer was a delight.","Written December 4, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Good, but you need to pay attention for all","First of all is not as the same as the universal parks in USA, and I got a little beat surprised that there open the doors of the park earlier, also you need to ask for all the information about the schedule of activities, also in weekends you need to reserve a fast pass or when you enter the park go for the fast pass of the attractions you must like.

In my case I also had a problem in the tax free, and the don't help me. In the park all the things were well but after buying a lot of things they don't return you the tax of 10% only 8% also if you buy things for a friend in Japan you can apply for it to tax free, because you can open the bag until you leave Japan.","Written December 2, 2019"

If I hadn't, I am predicting my rating might be higher. It was very similar to the US version we went to, except everything was in Japanese, at times hard to understand (especially for kids).

When we first arrived, we sent straight for the Harry Potter ride. It stopped half way through and we were left hanging for 2-3 ? minutes, luckily we weren't upside down. However, the staff were amazing, and let us ride a second time without having to line up.

The Terminator experience was amazing, I loved how they used a combination of 3D with people actors. Even though it was in Japanese, we could understand what was happening, it was very well articulated.

Food is very expensive! For a budget holiday, eat before you go, go early and then leave. We were there for about 3 hours. A fun family experience.",

Season/Tickets
We visited in November so definitely out of the main season so neither had to wait long in entrence line, nor did we need the extra free tickets to the wizard world people have been writing about - because there weren’t that many crowds.

We also bought the tickets at the main gate but in high season I’d recommend to buy them in advance, the ticket-scan line should be shorter and faster.

Rides
For the main and most popular rides we waited at a maximum of 30minutes (even though the signs said 40-50min). We had the Standard tickets so it was more than descent waiting time knowing how long these lines can be.
If your main purpose is to do the rides or you’re visiting during prime season I’d recommend the Express ticket which allows one to skip the line through the fast track.",

2. Do get your express ticket (I chooses 4 ride) it saves you tons of time queuing.

3. If you are not getting the express ticket, then separate from your group of friends and take the single lane instead.

4. You can bring empty water bottle inside to refill water in the park. No outside food allowed.

5. Organise which ride you want to go first then move from there, instead of running back and forth. It saves your energy.

6. Not enough cash to buy those cute souvenir or dine in restaurant? You can use credit card.

7. There a small Q beside the Harry Potter shop nearby the giant 🌲, you get to visit the experience how Ollivanders in Diagon Alley chooses the wand. Surprise? He will select a random person from the crowd and gave out a wand.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Winter Special is really special!,"I booked a ticket to USJ on Klook (try to book on a weekday if possible) and since it was a Saturday, I expected the long queue, so I was there 10 minutes before it opened up. First mission, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey.

I followed the attraction and ended up riding most of the rides, as I went there solo, so I could use the single rider lane. So the waiting wasn't really that bad for me, except for the Jurassic Park the ride (40 minutes queuing for a less than 1 min ride). Since I went there in November, they have already started their winter special, and boy oh boy, it was really special. Don't miss the Harry Potter Winter Special and the Crystal Night Parade. I suggest go for the Crystal first, then run to Harry Potter. The show for Harry Potter will repeat every 15 minutes for 2 hours. And for the show, the language is in English, so fret not for those non-Japanese speaking tourist.

Food for halal traveller can be tricky, but I found a pizza parlour that serves non-meat pizza and it was delicious.
Overall, don't miss USJ in Autumn. It would be better if I can't understand Japanese.","Written November 17, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great fun day out!,"Super rides and great placemaking with fake streets and sets that look great. Staff were very happy and helpful and additional shows took place across the park for free.

Highly recommend the Harry Potter area, Jaws Ride and Jurassic Park rides.

The only downside was most announcements and video introductions to the rides didn’t have English subtitles (I don’t recommend going into Backdraft because the whole thing is explained in Japanese! Unusual considering it is an American brand)

Otherwise a highly recommended and fun day out, with affordable food options and a good selection of shops. Only big downside was no WiFi, not great for tourists who don’t have access to 4G and get bored in queues!",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Lovely, clean grounds and cute merchandise!
(Skip the Christmas Crystal show)","It was my second trip to USJ this year. The first time around May this year and I thoroughly enjoyed myself even going with 2 very young kids (1.5yo and 3.5yo) My kids were very entertained with Sesame street, Minions, Hello Kitty and the Snoopy rides. If you were wondering if bringing young kids is difficult, it is not. It is a kid friendly place although with very young kids it is still quite a hassle. There are also plenty of food options. I unfortunately did not manage to try the exciting rides so I can't review those. The night parade was especially spectacular! My husband was blown away and decided to purchase the annual pass because of the parade.

HOWEVER, from 14th November 2019, the nightly parade is being done away and in its place is a Christmas Crystal performance which would cost you a further ¥1500+ to watch it. SKIP IT. The performances were rather nice...there were fireworks at the end but I think it would only entertain true Christmas fans. There were no familiar USJ characters participating in the Christmas performances so kids might get bored fast. We thought the usual nightly parades are so much better.","Written November 14, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,USJ Tips for families,"We went there on a weekday in October with two young school aged kids and I thought I’d leave a few tips for others who may be visiting the park while in Osaka. - Ticket purchase: buy them online in advance to save queuing up on the day. - Consider using ‘direct-in’ with QR codes on your phone. If you have small children and have to use only your phone to enter, this isn’t an issue either, just make sure you display each QR for each child at the gate. - If you have a Japanese friend, you can also ask them to help you order tickets through Lawson (Convenient store) and pay in any Lawson Loppi machine rather than ordering from Klook or Voyagin. - If your birthday is a month before or a month after the planned visit day, you can get discount, though to get this discount you have to go into their official web page which is in Japanese so this might not be easy. If you speak Japanese or have a friend who does, this could save you a bit of money. We saved 500 yen per ticket (family members are also entitled to the same discount). - Express Pass: choose the date/day of your visit and you might not need this. We considered spending £700 on the day pass plus Express pass 4 for four of us and in the end we didn’t and it worked out more than ok. (More details as below) - Pick a normal weekday and make sure it isn’t a local holiday etc and check the crowd forecast before booking your tickets - Arrive early because they often open earlier than the official opening time. We arrived at 7.10 for 8.30 opening and the gate actually opened 45 min earlier than expected so we managed to get in before 8am, gaining the valuable 45min to make a head start! When we went, the park was a lot less busy in the morning but as the day went on it was busier and by 1pm it was double the amount of people or more so use your morning time well! - Use your lunch time well, eat early or eat much later as people tend to go to take time away from going to attractions around this time. Strictly speaking no food from outside is allowed, and they do indeed check your bags from time to time, but you can sneak in a couple of rice balls or sausage in your jacket pockets (there is Lawson around the corner) to save you both the money and time to queue up for food at lunch time. - Use the board to check the waiting times for different attractions and be flexible in your plan - Take bottles to fill up water with so that valuable time isn’t spent on queuing at a cafe to get drinks etc - Check out the time for the parade and be at the start of the parade at least 30 min before to get a good spot - this is particularly important for those with small children as they can’t get a good view with too many people in front of them. The leaflet shows the route for the parade. - Harry Potter area: Previously you needed time entry pass to this area but these days it is a free entry area unless it is exceptionally busy. We had no wait time at all to get on Forbidden Journey first thing in the morning by just making a dash to the area (with two young kids too!) and going straight in. - Take disposable water proofs from 100 yen shop so that you don’t get wet when you are on some of the rides! - Don’t miss out the castle light up at Harry Potter area! It was meant to be at 18.55 (for the first showing) but it actually started at 18.30 presumably because there were a lot of people gathering already. This is in front of the castle, in the open. I would recommend you to get there at least 30 min early but if not, note you don’t need to be right at the front of the crowd; most of the entertainment is the light effects on the castle which you can see from quite far back so don’t panic if you don’t manage to get there early to get to the front of the crowd. - Wait time: remember that the wait time sign is often overestimated. This is the times and time we spent queuing at each attractions we went: 7:55am HP Forbidden Journey - no wait time 8.35am Jurassic Park the Ride estimated wait time 25 min but got on the ride in 10min 8.55am Jurassic Park the Ride (kids wanted to go on it again) same again 10min 10am Sing on (show) Got there 15 min early and we got in ok 11.15am Minion Ride - estimated wait time 50 min but it was only 30 min in the end 12.45am Amazing Spider-Man estimated wait time 75 min but got on the ride in 40 min Had Late lunch 14:00 am Went to get a good spot for the parade staring at 14.30 am. Already people taking up their spots and regretted not coming sooner. We spent the rest of the day visiting different areas covering different street shows etc. My final and perhaps one of most important tips that I can give to families with children visiting USJ... Do take your kids to toilet before queuing for each attraction! Despite taking kids to the restroom regularly, we still got ourselves in a situation whereby one of our kids went, mummmm I need to go to the toilet half way through a very long queue with no option of going back!! Luckily the queue moved quickly and she managed to hold on till the end of the ride, but it was pretty stressful!! Oh and have a chat with kids to decide on a memorable location to meet in case you get separated. We decided that beside the dinosaur at the entrance of Jurassic Park area was a good place to remember at the start :) We enjoyed our visit to USJ (though it was VERY tiring lol) and hope you will too!!",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Fun and well maintained park,Overall the park was a pleasant visit. It had a combination of classic and new ride attractions. The roller coasters were the main highlight and were both thrilling and fun. As usual for amusement parks the wait times were hours long so an express pass at a much higher price may be the way to go to make waits less frustrating and exhausting. I would recommend this for all families visiting Osaka.,
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Express pass ain’t worth it,"My friends and I planned to get express pass to go on the rides but apparently you choose which one and what time and can only go once. They had one that was 7 rides express and costs nearly double the entry price. In LA, you can get an express pass and use it unlimited. We chose not to get the express pass and just follow the crowd but we had the plan by going in the single riders line which cut the time but made my friends and I seperate which wasn’t an issue for us. Also it wasn’t overly busy as the lines were pretty good.","Written November 13, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,A fun day!,"We came to USJ on the eve of Halloween and it was very crowded (not sure if it was more than usual). But besides that we had a great time exploring the park and taking various rides.

A highlight (and the main reason) for me to visit USJ was the Harry Potter attraction. It was particularly special at night when the lights were turned on.

What I really liked about USJ was that there were ample benches around if you got tired walking and wanted to rest for abit. What would be nice is if there were more English translation for the attractions.

Tip: if possible, buy your tickets online so you skip the long queue at the ticket booth. It will save you at least half an hour. If you are a tourist and buy enough merchandise to claim back tax, be prepared for a VERY long queue.

At the end of a long day, we were exhausted, hungry and not prepared for the super long queue to claim back tax! (It took at least 45 mins.) This is no fault of USJ though, the staff tried to get through the line as fast as possible but the time taken was simply due to the number of tourists. Just a heads up incase this is useful for anyone.","Written November 12, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Full day of fun,"You would need 2 days to experience everything. Son particularly enjoyed the sesame street stuff and spiderman. The harry porter world was surreal. Highly recommend that one would reserve a time ticket to enter. Went in the morning without much fuss. However, come evening, was refused entry as we did not get the time ticket. The wand was not fully utilized. Till next time, expecto patronum...","Written November 12, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Far too busy - yet they carried on letting people in,"You know you're in for a busy day when it takes 80 minutes just to get in the park entrance. Once inside the crowds just continued and there was very little respite anywhere. The theming inside is one of the best I have seen in a park, with areas to cater for all ages and tastes, and the rides are as good as you would expect from Universal - but there must be a point when they decide that there are too many people in one place, and the day we were there we went well beyond that.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,A must visit,"The place was great, specially the Harry Potter area, the butter beer is a must, the ques are very long tho, but we had the express pass so we were able to zoom right in front, it's worth the extra charge, a lot of attention is in Japanese so we weren't able to understand 70% of the shows, but it was a great experience","Written November 9, 2019"

Bought the express pass. Even though it’s quite costly, it can really save a lot of time for the rides. Harry Potter ride was the most enjoyable ride. The express pass does not allow re-entry so we went to queue for another ride. Waiting time was closed to an hour.

Minion ride was quite good too. Spider-Man ride was so-so. Quite disappointed with the terminator show.

Overall it’s an enjoyable trip, minus the rain.",

Great day out!","Written October 27, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Best day EVER,"Today was my daughters 10th Birthday. I have patiently and methodically planned the days outing as a surprise which has been expensive and at times stressful with language barriers and pre paid tickets being absolutely compulsory.
Last week we attempted to visit Disneyland and it was sold out. Long story but could not risk that happening on my daughters birthday today.
But pre paid tickets and express passes once in Japan and without access to a printer or translator is not that easy.
Be patient. Allow yourself lots of time to read all the reviews and tips on what you need. Don’t pounce on the first ticket sale you come across. Some do not allow an upgrade if you decide to get the express pass - whereas you may have got a package to include that with the ground pass.
EXPRESS PASS IS A MUST. It’s the Business Class of Theme Park experience. Not in a conceited way but after spending biiiiig money on the bullet train and knowing it was going to be a 14hr day it was well worth being able to walk through without a queue. Ohhhhh it was well worth it!
I’m still not entirely sure exactly what I paid for as I tried to get Express into something and it didn’t count and I thought I bought the top level Express but I really only wanted to make sure we got to Harry Potter without a queue. For that you only need an express pass if you are doing the rides. Diagon Alley is open to everyone so if you only want to walk through the castle and not do the simulated ride don’t worry about an Express pass or timed entry. It only takes about 5 mins.
The staff at the park were fantastic. Well organised and friendly. My daughter had a birthday sticker we got at family services and everyone made a fuss when they spotted it.
You do have to push your way through to get photos with characters as many adults line up and as they are dressed up so attract attention and get in front of the children. We got better at that as the day went on.
Harry Potter world is great!! Definitely eat in the Hall!! What a fabulous set up.
Find your way through the shops and see if there is a sorting hat etc. we got a little rushed as it was raining and cramped.
The park is a great size to easily walk around many times in a day.
Good level of rides and attractions for younger and older children.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,fantastic,well the flip side is we went on a weekday and still FACED LONG QUES! this explains the park in one line. the rides were fantastic and thrilling. far better than Disney land in Tokyo! we loved it but only took 1 day pass - if this is how a weekday is then please take 2 day pass else the rides are going to take min 2 hours for the turn and by 7pm the main attractions close. so its hard to fit all the fun parts in 1 day,"Written October 24, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Amazing but Busy,"Great time but extremely crowded. Bought the fast track 4 for an extra £100pp (ouch !) as hate queues. But beware - worked well on H Potter - 20m instead of 1h20m. Big attraction was Flying Dinsaur, BUT... the fast track only was valid from 19.10pm, probably to keep us there all day ... turned away at 18.00 and 19.08 (!!) 15m to ride instead of 1h40m - fair improvement. The other two fast tracks were hardly worth it. Jaws was only 18m wait (single rider) and pretty much free for all entry into the massive Terminator theatre .... You pays your money you takes your choice ...","Written October 23, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Better than Disney in Tokyo!!,"We went to Universal on the last day of our Japan holiday and what a way to finish!! We had pre-booked our entrance tickets but also our fast-pass tickets noting that the fast pass tickets cost more than the park tickets themselves - but for me were totally worth it. Be reminded that if you choose to buy your fast pass tickets on the day, you will pay top wack as the prices fluctuate the closer you get to the date you want to go.....make sense?? Please carefully choose your fast pass ticket bundle - from memory, you can do bundles with 3, 4 or 7 rides. Unknowingly we selected all the top rides which was a bonus as the queue time for some of these rides (like the Flying Dinosaur) ended up being 120 mins!! Like Disney, the park itself was rammed - more so when we went as there was a Halloween special, with lots of people walking round in fancy dress. The rides are awesome. I have 3 boys (aged 13, 10 and 8) where our favorite rides were The Flying Dinosaur, Hollywood - The Ride, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey as well as the motion based 3D rides such as Spider-Man and Despicable Me. There are height restrictions on some of the roller coasters (I think min 132 cm) but my 8 year old was tall enough. We had lunch - quality was pretty good although grossly overpriced however loads of restaurants and outlets to choose from. We got to the park early and stayed for over 12 hours - yes we were knackered by the end of the day but was totally worth it! The park is well connected to the JR network with its own station which takes you back into the centre of Osaka so we had no trouble getting back to our hotel afterwards. For me, Universal was better than Disney in Tokyo, a fantastic place to have lots of fun with the kids!!",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great experience with the VIP pass,"We bought our VIP passes.
Picking up the bracelet from the 16th floor of the viewing tower was no problem. Also finding out the exact opening time of the park for tomorrow went very well (07:00 in our case).
On the day itself we were 25 minutes before this time at the meeting point Studio West entrance.
The queue at VIP was a bit shorter than at the normal entrance.
But ALL entrances were opened at the same time. The VIPs were NOT admitted earlier than the others.
Is the VIP ticket worth it? Yes, because you know the exact opening hours and can plan better how early you want to queue.
But you don't get in earlier than people with normal tickets.
For the Harry Potter world you don't have to get a time ticket in the park so early in the morning (at least not before 09:00 a.m.).
We could complete the main line at Harry Potter 3 times without queuing. It was totally worth it - a great experience!
After 09:00 the park get very full (we visited the park on a monday).","Written October 22, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Awesome tematic park,"The Harry Potter part is unbelievable! really well recreated, you can do magic! But for that you should buy a wand from the park..","Written October 22, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Overpriced, overcrowded and overrated","This place sucks. First of all, it's very overpriced. The cost of general admission is more than Disneyland, and it fails to produce the magic of that park in any way. The cost of everything inside the park is also overpriced. The food is terrible and expensive, as is all the merchandise. A normal t-shirt is 3,600 yen! Even the souvenir coins are 200 yen to make (they are 100 yen everywhere else). It's a cash grab theme park and they try and milk you for every last coin.

Secondly, it's overcrowded. We went on a Tuesday and the more popular rides still had 2 hour waiting times. You can bypass some of this by purchasing express passes, but those are over twice the cost of admission, which puts the cost at $160 per person. No thanks. Disney gives out free fast passes throughout the day; why can't this park do the same? There are queues for everything. Even getting something like ice cream or a drink is a 30 minute wait.

It was a hot day when we visited, and there is a significant lack of shade. In fact, the only real shade is at the entrance. This doesn't make any sense. Or perhaps they want all of us to sweat more so that we buy more expensive drinks?

The Harry Potter ride is good, as is the minions, but the rest is overrated. Speaking of Harry Potter, if you're hoping to purchase a wand, it will set you back 4900 yen. Butterbeer is 1300 yen with a souvenir plastic glass. Stuffed animals are 4000 yen, and any kind of clothing, well, you get the idea.","Written October 21, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Way too crowded,"Lots of interesting rides and a must go, however, unless u have an express pass Most rides are between 2-3 hours.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Q-niversal studios,"Universal studios Japan was the biggest disappointment. Lines as long as the human eye can see... for peanuts and popcorn stands! Expect to queue around 180-220 minutes for some of the bigger rides (Hollywood dream etc). Expect to wait around 4 hours to get into Harry Potter. Don’t even think about going if it’s a rainy day or you begin a game of darts where your eye is the board and the umbrella is the dart. Once we decided that the rides were too long a wait, we thought to pop into a restaurant or coffee shop to have a sit down, but this was not an option either. I’m starting to think maybe I’ve missed something and the fun is in the queuing??? Would recommend going if you’re just starting a new relationship and you want to find out the name of your potential other halves great great grandfathers dog.

Souvenir shops were so busy it was a shoplifters / pick pocketers dream. A sea of people make you feel like you’re travelling during rush hour on London’s central line, if everyone dressed up as minions to go to work.

In the 6 hours we were there, my husband and I managed to go on two rides. The Jurassic Park ride (2 hour queue) and the Spider-Man ride (over 2 hour queue... lost count of the minutes). We’re pretty fit people and in our 20’s but my husband said he felt like his feet were gonna throw up! Is this even possible? Only at Q-niversal!

We were allowed to leave with a stamp to re-enter later so we could eat something outside as it was just far too busy inside. When we returned, we had to queue AGAIN to enter! It was raining and around 5pm at this point so it was certainly not getting any quieter.

Honestly was expecting a super fun day but now that my daydreams lead to flashbacks of queues and crowds I think I’m gonna need to be treated for PTSD.","Written October 21, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Very dated and a bit flat,"My wife and I visited USJ as we had a bit of time on our hands and fancied a bit of fun. It’s quite confusing as to what is open and covered on a standard ticket. The park itself was lacking in rides and many of the attractions we went to were just a bit too dated, just like when they opened in the nineties. It’s very expensive and the atmosphere if you don’t have children is just a bit flat. I know theme parks largely cater to families but if you don’t fall into that category what’s on offer is just a bit stale.","Written October 15, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Fun, but disappointed with some arrangements","I have been to USJ for 3 times, and each time they changed some attractions which makes it very fun to go to. However, was disappointed the last time I was there when I bought express pass to go to Lupin the 3rd, but the show / game was closed and they simply assigned me to any one of the old attractions that they have. I mean this is really not a compensation if you were going to the park for that particular show / game... hope they can have some improvement in the future...","Written October 13, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Worth a visit,We went to USJ on a Monday but the park was full with visitors. Average queueing time was 60-90 minutes. Some visitors really live up to the Helloween theme and they do dressed up. Most of the rides are fantastic. I like the Harry Potter show where the castle was full with lights.,
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,One of the highlights of our trip to Japan,"We took our children (aged 6 and 8) to USJ on a Tuesday in early October and had the most wonderful day. We booked tickets online and arrived at around 11am. There were no lines for entry at that time and we went straight through. I'm glad that we didn't arrive earlier.
We had read that the lines for rides were long, so we weren't surprised that we had to wait a while for some of the attractions.
Overview of some of the rides that we went on:
- Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey: Easily the best ride that we went on.
We lined up for 35 minutes at 11:45am but we managed to ride it another three times without a queue at 6:30 pm!
- Minion Mayhem: We lined up for around 45 minutes. I thought it was pretty average and not worth the wait but the kids enjoyed it.
- Spiderman: Another crazy long wait and they hide the queue around corners. Not worth it if you have young kids.
- Jaws: Exciting little river ride during which the host pretends to shoot her gun at sharks. 6-year-old LOVED it.
-Jurassic Park Ride: Holy Moly. I was expecting a flat river ride with a few 'scary' dinosaurs and a bit of a wave at the end. I was NOT expecting the very steep ascent and rollercoaster drop that preceded that wave. EEEEEK!
- Flight of the Hippogriff: Quick little rollercoaster (long queue). Kids loved it.
- Snoopy ride: Nice for little kids- not worth waiting in a big queue for.
- Elmo Skateboard: Our kids LOVED this one. Queue was never long.
- Elmo(?) Cars: Very slow kiddy 'racing' courses. There is one for 3-5 year olds and another one for older kids. Our 6-year-old loved it.","Written October 11, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Surprisingly disappointed,"I have visited Universal Studios a few times in Orlando and was very much looking forward to my trip to USJ. Firstly we got to the park really early to get our first fast pass. We already purchased our tickets so only had one queue to stand in. The queue was massive (this was supposed to be a less crowded day!). After standing in the queue for an hour just to get in, we rushed to get our first fast pass, we then went to Harry Potter ride. One hour in and all the fast passes were gone! The queue times were 170 minutes for almost all the rides. We decided to go on some of the less popular rides hoping the queues would abate but they did not. After a few hours we wanted to leave and come back later as it was really hot and it was very crowded but were told we could not return (this rule is just stupid!!) we ended giving up and leaving anyway.

I was disappointed that you could not leave the park and come back later.","Written October 11, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Unexpectedly Good... very interesting place,"we did not expect USJ will be this good. the top 3 attractions for us are: Spiderman, Terminator, and Harry Potter ride.
the only complain is, a lot of shows are in Japanese, and they do not have English translation, difficult for foreigner to understand.
Other than that, it was an amazing day in USJ","Written October 11, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Pick the right day to go,"Everything in Japan is crowded, that's just the way Japan is. That is why I did my best to plan my Universal trip so that I could miss as much of the crowd as possible. There are estimated crowd calendars online, so I made sure to line up my visit with a day that was the least crowded (in this case it was a Tuesday in May). I also made sure to buy my ticket online and line up before Universal even opened. It probably saved me from spending a good extra hour in line.

The park was fairly quiet for a good couple hrs after I arrived, and even when it did begin to crowd it was never super overwhelming.

Because I avoided the big crowds, I had a ton of fun. It's just like the Universal park in other parts of the world with a few minor exceptions. They love minions, so minions were everywhere. Wearing cute, furry character headbands are also a big thing over here so be prepared to see quirky headwear in every gift shop. They also celebrate holidays even after the holiday is over. I went at the end of may, and yet everything was still Easter themed. Minor things like this is what makes Universal Osaka unique, and I absolutely adored it.","Written October 11, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,USJ,"Even in mid-Sep 2019, it was still crowded.

Still enjoyed it especially the Halloween activities. No parade or fireworks though.",

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Ridiculous prices for express passes,"Express pass tickets can easily cost 2 to 5 times the price of the regular day ticket (you still have to buy the day ticket!).

Usually you can only use an express pass one time each for a select number of rides (depending on which express pass you get). You also can’t use an express pass until the time printed next to each ride on your express pass ticket has passed. This was not clearly explained at time of purchase and does not consider when you plan to leave.

While the rides were fun and the express passes helped. I’m still not sure if it is worth paying several times more for a heavily capped express pass.","Written October 7, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Harry Potter World,"I really wanted to go to HP World, but online I found it very hard to understand the ticket system. When I went to book tickets they always said, “Harry Potter World timed ticket not included”. Then when you clicked on get timed entry it was the express pass (but a lot of different options depending on days too). I don’t love rides so didn’t need the express pass and didn’t think worth the money, but couldn’t figure out the timed entry ticket part.

In the end I understood the express pass gives 30 minute time slots to different rides, to allow them to have a select number of people and guarantee low wait times. We went on a day that was 18,000 visitors (checked an online website that predicted amount of visitors) and we waited at most 20 minutes for each ride. Obviously the 30,000 visitor days would have more wait times. Overall, Harry Potter World didn’t need an express pass or timed entry and was simple enough. We really liked the feel of it, but also of course a bit silly for adults and it’s more geared towards kids.

Would definitely recommend for Harry Potter fans, but of course much better for people who love rides. The best unexpected part was the Water World show, very cool! Would recommend the shows for adults and kids alike!","Written October 7, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Toddler Friendly,"I booked tickets prior to going to OSAKA which was a great help and relatively cheaper. I have a 3 year old that loves Jaws. So basically, that was the goal of the trip - the jaws ride. But then I also wanted to go to the Harry Potter castle and have some butterbeer. The day turned out great and we had more fun than we expected. Since, we were with a toddler, i didn't have too much expectations on the rides because we could not go on most of them with my son. But despite all that, we still had a great time. And will probably still go there if ever we're in OSAKA.","Written October 6, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Went only for Harry Potter World,We made a day of Universal but my kids are only really interested in Harry Potter - unfortunately there are only 2 rides in this sector and the hippogriff ride was an incredibly short and disappointing ride for the amount of time one had to wait! We had fast passes for the other one thank god and we enjoyed a few butter beers and spent all our money on wands etc. The rest of the place was OK I guess but not really for us and we found it very difficult to find any half edible food - I paid a ridiculous amount of money for 3 revolting cold burgers and chips and had to hustle for a table. all in all the kids enjoyed the experience and now we never have to go again!!,"Written October 6, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great day out in Osaka,"Universal makes a great day out for families, couples or friends. Anyone who has been to the US versions will recognise a lot of the rides and attractions but that's where the similarities end. The park was predominately filled with Japanese people when we were there and the shows are all in Japanese, as are some of the rides. We didn't get a fast pass but were there at 7:15 for an 8:30 opening. As it happened, the park opened 15 mins early so we were one of the first in that weren't on the early access pass (total waste of money as they only got in 15mins ahead of us). We were able to make it to the Harry Potter attractions before the queues formed. Overall, we never waited longer than an hour for any ride and early in the day we got through the queues faster so got on some rides twice.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Fantastic fun, queues were too long.",We had an amazing day here. The absolute highlight was The Harry Potter village and ride which is just outstanding and worth the visit on it’s own. We arrived early and were able to get into the first 2 rides quite quickly (under 30 mins) but for the rest of the day the queues for the main rides at each village became really long (40-60 mins). We waited almost 2 hours to ride the Hollywood!!!! The express pass is too expensive. A suggestion to the park would be to extend the system of virtual queuing that is available in the children’s section to some of the other popular rides to alleviate queue times and allow visitors to spend more time (and money) in other attractions. For other guests I think avoid Saturdays if you can. Still fab though and we all loved it.,"Written October 5, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Way to expensive.,"We spent 2 days here and spent so much time in lines even with an express pass at a disgusting high price, trying to get issues sorted was not easy, food etc was also very expensive.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Best day at universal!,"I was really nervous about whether or not we would need to buy an express pass to go on rides. Ended up not getting one and arrived at the park at midday. Went on Tuesday 1st October and walked straight into the park and straight onto Harry Potter and the forbidden journey. After reading the reviews I was very surprised that there was no line but just a nice walk through the castle to the ride! Around this time most lines were advertising about 30 minutes but we then walked straight onto the Spider-Man ride after that. As the day went on things seemed the get busier between 3pm until about 7:30pm when times for rides went down again. Waited about 30 mins for space fantasy and then 60 minutes single rider line for the flying dinosaur. Ended up being very glad we didn't buy the express passes as only needed them on 2 rides and if we stayed from 8-9pm rather than leaving at 8pm we could have done them then. Harry Potter world is amazing and butter beer is delicious. A great day out!

Only con is the food is more expensive than regular theme parks so be ready for that.","Written October 1, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,It's worth the visit!,"Props to the warm and friendly staff at Universal Studios, Japan for ensuring the safety of the crowd while guiding and entertaining the crowd! 

Before making your way towards the Harry Potter section of Universal, you might want to check out the schedules for the 4D movie or head over to water world first (correct me if I'm wrong but they close earlier than the rest of the theme park?) before spending the rest of the afternoon sipping on butterbeer, getting your wands, having a meal, hop onto the award-winning Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ride. 

While you're there, you won't want to miss out on the parade which is worth the wait!

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Excellent,"Excellent theme park, much enjoyed my time here. Being a theme park, F&B items are going to be a bit more expensive, but it is not outrageous. I spent 3800 JPY on lunch for 2. The rest are all on you, water dispensers are available throughout the park and resting areas are plentiful.

Some tips:
Be there early: We were at the park at 0735 which was 1 hour ahead of the park opening and there were already long queues with hundreds upon hundreds of people waiting. The gates opened earlier than expected at 0810 instead of 0830 however.

Get an express pass: You will need it to avoid the crazy long queues. Queues can be extremely long at popular rides. I was a single rider on The Flying Dinosaur, entered the queue showing 35 minute wait and eventually waited slightly more than an hour. I finished the ride, looked at the queue board. Normal: 120 minutes. Single: 110 minutes. You can figure this yourself.

Consider planning a rushed start where you're moving fast and running and hitting all the big attractions/rides before the crowd comes. Then tuning down into relaxed mode once you've cleared those rides. Refer to above express pass comment. This also works in favour if you already have an express pass because you will need to make choices on what rides do you want to use your express pass on. For example, we did the Harry potter ride using express pass. We had an option of using the express pass for Jaws which was the next area, but we queued for it instead as the queue was ""only"" 30 minutes and saved the pass for Terminator.

Some ride review:
The Harry Potter ride was excellent, but one tip, lean forward and rest on the shoulder rest. I thought I wanna sit back and relax but my view was partially blocked until I leaned forward and my ride became better. It is nevertheless an excellent ride. You will need to stow your baggage in the provided lockers.

Terminator 2: 3D
This is definitely worth your time. 30 minutes of a sit-back-and-enjoy show.

Spiderman 4k
Upon reaching the end of the queue and seeing the ride, I asked myself: ""Is this recycled from Transformers?"" I didn't find this ride enjoyable not because the 3D glasses were constantly being knocked off my face from the movement and I had to hold on to it all the way, but it was really just bland for me. Transformers was much better and I really think this Spiderman is recycled from Transformers but I could be wrong.

I didn't do the Minion ride as our express pass was for a very late timing and my partner was very tired. So we left early. It's a great place to visit nevertheless albeit the expensive express pass.","Written September 29, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,The best day!,"We were almost put off going by all the negative research we read about long queues, expensive food and strategizing, but we ended up having the best day! We went on a Thursday, which I highly recommend doing if you can. The queues to enter started to build up about an hour before opening and as people went in they were literally sprinting to get to the rides. Eventually everyone calmed down when they realised the average wait for a ride was about 30 minutes. We are huge Harry Potter fans and this zone was just magical; we spent four hours there and went on the Forbidden Journey three times over the course of the day as it was just so good! We had a lot of fun casting spells around the zone with the magical versions of the wands. The food was a bit pricey, but the portions and quality were good. It was a great day out, helped enormously by going on a quieter week day I imagine. So go have fun!","Written September 29, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Highlight of my trip. Definitely not to miss!,"With all the hype and people reviewing this place, I made sure to add this to my agenda while visiting Osaka. Even though the entrance ticket and express pass was quite pricey in my opinion I thought it was worth every penny. The studio definitely had a lot to offer and we basically stayed from morning till night (solid 11 hours).

We visited USJ recently, towards the end of September. I can honestly point out that the vibe between daytime and nighttime varies greatly due to the Halloween theme it has provided.

Even though we visited USJ on a Wendesday, the place was filled with people therefore express pass became a necessity item instead of a luxury therefore be sure to purchase the tickets while you book online through Klook (which was what I did). Given the duration we stayed, we had enough time to go on all the rides / performances we wanted to go at least once (except Minion Ride). Personally, the rides I enjoyed greatly was the Flying Dinosaur (av. 120mins wait) and The Harry Potter 4K ride (av. 100mins wait), not to be mistaken with Flight of the Hippogriff. (Both of which I used the express pass to go through).

We were fortunate enough to enjoy a couple rides that were only available during the Halloween season therefore I would recommend checking their official website before hand to see which ones are available on that period. The one I couldn't enjoy was ""Biohazard™: The Extreme."" This experience provides a handful of tickets and can only be picked up by their entrance. I didn't do my homework and ultimately missed this opportunity.

After 18:00 the venue became a lot more interesting. As soon as you hear the announcement that zombies / monsters / creatures will come out as a parade, the atmosphere was spectacular. All of a sudden, the environment became hauntingly entertaining. There were live performances that involved dancing, instrumental, singing and most entertaining of all, general interaction with the public. If you're looking to visit USJ, I highly recommend coming during the Halloween season!

Last but not least, I will share some parade photos only since it is not always available.",

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Best universal studio experience!,"Well, as we do have a Universal Studio in Sentosa (and we had annual pass), which is just a 30-min-drive away from home, we looked forward to something unique in Universal Studio Japan, and they nailed it!

Of course we don't have Harry Potter and Minion rides in Singapore, but the real differentiator is the attention to ""customer experience"" in every single detail. I will not go into details as I don't want to turn this review into a ""design thinking"" analysis. You just need to be there to experience it.

It is highly recommended to get the express pass (although it is rather expensive). They do not have one single express pass for everything. Instead, they have a set of express passes you can choose. It looks complicated at first glance but is actually very easy to understand once you read a bit more. You should study the options a bit and choose the most suitable one according to your plan and interests.

The only thing I think can be better is that, they do not sell tickets and express pass in their website. Instead their website provides the link to authorized 3rd party agency for you to buy tickets online. This additional layer caused me a bit problem: in fact the express pass does not include the one day pass for you to enter the park first. However, the 3rd party agency website doesn't highlight this to me when I purchased the express pass. Even worse, they told me the express pass is ""direct in"" (turned out it means it is ""direct in"" for the ride, not for the park entrance). We had to re-queue at the ticket office to buy the one day pass when we were there.","Written September 27, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Amazing afternoon out!,"(English couple from London) My partner and I are mid-twenties and from London. Having done Disneysea already we were in two minds to go here on a hot afternoon. We bought the Twilight pass at 3pm for 6,000Yen and managed to ride EVERY SINGLE RIDE in 6 hours!! It is ten times more magical than Disney here and you do not need Express Passes so no need to overspend. This was the perfect ending to our holiday. It doesn’t make a difference that everything was in Japanese, the rollercoasters were incredible. We rode in single passengers where possible. There was no queues in Harry Potter at all and we got straight on those rides at 20:30. Bring some snacks and you won’t have to spend a penny here!

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Bigger than expected!,"We spent the whole day here and still couldn’t get through everything. The place was so much bigger than expected!

Like all theme parks, you need to be prepared to wait, otherwise pay extra for the express pass. Here are a few tips:
- plan where you want to go and stick to it!
- get there early for the Harry Potter ride. Hogwarts castle was awesome
- Don’t bother with Curious George
- Get the unlimited drinks pass. That allows you unlimited soft drinks and coffee at 7 different restaurants. I bought just one for the whole family :).
- go there when the weather is cooler because there’s not much shelter outside

The place was super clean and like every else in Japan , everyone was courteous and friendly. So if you and your family are the patient type, you’ll have a great time here.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Fantastic Day Out, Large Rides Busy but Plenty of other things to do","We have visited Universal Studios in Florida many times so it was slightly nostalgic to be visiting an almost identical layout in a foreign country. The newly opened Minions Park Area was brilliant much larger than that in the USA. We were there on what was classed as a quiet day so didnt bother with the express pass which can be very expensive. We managed most of the rides within 5-10 mins using the available single rider queues. Lines for Harry Potter and the larger coasters were in the 60 min range and due to a thunderstorm unfortunately these closed down for a period so we missed out doing these. You can choose to just do the Castle walkthrough for Harry Potter if you dont want to ride the Forbidden Journey. Jurassic Park, Spider Man, Jaws and Minions we all managed twice. I would highly recomment the WaterWorld stunt show too it was great to watch even if you didnt understand Japanese. Lots of dining options including Mels Diner although I would advise booking if you want any of the themed restuarants the queue for the Happiness Cafe was over an hour long at lunchtime. Lots of different merchandise to choose from too. Very easy transportation from the Centre of Osaka we took the Universal City Train to the station and it was literally a 5 min walk into City Walk and then the park. Great Day all round. Once you leave the park you cannot re-enter so I would advise eating beforehand as it can be pricy inside and then head to City Walk on your way home.","Written September 25, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,You don't need the express pass,"Decided last minute to come here as a couple. Bought tickets at the entrance at face value 7400 plus tax (per person). Considered getting the express pass but the dealers online were trying to sell them at 4x face value (roughly 4xx USD per person). Decided not to get them as I found the idea of spending close to 800 USD on going to Universal for 1 day absolutely absurd. I was just at Universal in Orlando and purchased the express pass at face value.

At this particular park, you can ride as a single person and the wait is usually about 20 minutes per ride. My partner and I did this for every ride except Minions which doesn't offer this service. For example, the Harry Potter ride had a huge line and the wait time was 70 plus minutes. We went on the singles line, together, and we were on the ride in 15 minutes. Same thing with Spiderman although the wait time was roughly 40 minutes compared to 70 for the normal line. Most of the other rides were 10 to 20 minutes on the singles line. The two rollercoasters had long lines on both the normal line and the singles line. The lady hates rollercoasters so I never had the chance to ride them.

We arrived at 10am although it took 1 hour to buy a ticket and enter the park. If we arrived at 8am like the other guests, we easily would have been able to do every ride here and watch several of the shows. On September 30th, there were quite a few people as the local schools were closed due to some kind've sports event. So the place was packed.

The express pass is obviously better but if you are with a group of friends / couple, you could still do everything if you use our strategy.

Go to guest services when you arrive and find out which rides you can sign up for. We signed up for the new ride based on resident evil and only waited a few minutes because of this ticket.

Area 51 is easily the most underrated attraction at the park. Line is only 20 to 30 minutes and the actual ""ride"" is close to 30 minutes. May not be suitable for young children.

I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars due to the food situation. 99% of the food is pretty unhealthy and you have to wait in long lines just to get something to eat. I am positive this is done intentionally to force the customer to wait in cue to eat to relieve pressure off of the lines at the main attractions. It took over 20 minutes just to get a hot dog. While universal could hire more people or have more food carts, it is obvious that they have chose to inconvenience the customer for their own benefit. Also if you are Jewish, Muslim, a vegetarian, have celiac disease or some other kind of food allergy, you aren't going to be happy here. Don't expect any Kosher, Halal, vegan, gluten free, etc. at most places. The Universal studios in Florida does a pretty decent job labeling the food in the markets but I didn't see that here. Perhaps I didn't investigate it enough. Would give it 5 stars if they were able to address this but I doubt that will happen. There's nothing worse than spending all this money and then being told you cannot bring outside food into the park, especially if you have legitimate concerns. Perhaps universal can just charge a self serve fee but again I am just dreaming.

Also more bathrooms would be nice. Had to wait in line for that as well...","Written September 30, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Whole day of fun.,Provided whole day of fun for the whole family. It’s a shame that the Express Pass are more expensive than the actual entrance ticket.,"Written September 30, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Excellent,"Excellent theme park, much enjoyed my time here. Being a theme park, F&B items are going to be a bit more expensive, but it is not outrageous. I spent 3800 JPY on lunch for 2. The rest are all on you, water dispensers are available throughout the park and resting areas are plentiful.

Some tips:
Be there early: We were at the park at 0735 which was 1 hour ahead of the park opening and there were already long queues with hundreds upon hundreds of people waiting. The gates opened earlier than expected at 0810 instead of 0830 however.

Get an express pass: You will need it to avoid the crazy long queues. Queues can be extremely long at popular rides. I was a single rider on The Flying Dinosaur, entered the queue showing 35 minute wait and eventually waited slightly more than an hour. I finished the ride, looked at the queue board. Normal: 120 minutes. Single: 110 minutes. You can figure this yourself.

Consider planning a rushed start where you're moving fast and running and hitting all the big attractions/rides before the crowd comes. Then tuning down into relaxed mode once you've cleared those rides. Refer to above express pass comment. This also works in favour if you already have an express pass because you will need to make choices on what rides do you want to use your express pass on. For example, we did the Harry potter ride using express pass. We had an option of using the express pass for Jaws which was the next area, but we queued for it instead as the queue was ""only"" 30 minutes and saved the pass for Terminator.

Some ride review:
The Harry Potter ride was excellent, but one tip, lean forward and rest on the shoulder rest. I thought I wanna sit back and relax but my view was partially blocked until I leaned forward and my ride became better. It is nevertheless an excellent ride. You will need to stow your baggage in the provided lockers.

Terminator 2: 3D
This is definitely worth your time. 30 minutes of a sit-back-and-enjoy show.

Spiderman 4k
Upon reaching the end of the queue and seeing the ride, I asked myself: ""Is this recycled from Transformers?"" I didn't find this ride enjoyable not because the 3D glasses were constantly being knocked off my face from the movement and I had to hold on to it all the way, but it was really just bland for me. Transformers was much better and I really think this Spiderman is recycled from Transformers but I could be wrong.

I didn't do the Minion ride as our express pass was for a very late timing and my partner was very tired. So we left early. It's a great place to visit nevertheless albeit the expensive express pass.","Written September 29, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,The best day!,"We were almost put off going by all the negative research we read about long queues, expensive food and strategizing, but we ended up having the best day! We went on a Thursday, which I highly recommend doing if you can. The queues to enter started to build up about an hour before opening and as people went in they were literally sprinting to get to the rides. Eventually everyone calmed down when they realised the average wait for a ride was about 30 minutes. We are huge Harry Potter fans and this zone was just magical; we spent four hours there and went on the Forbidden Journey three times over the course of the day as it was just so good! We had a lot of fun casting spells around the zone with the magical versions of the wands. The food was a bit pricey, but the portions and quality were good. It was a great day out, helped enormously by going on a quieter week day I imagine. So go have fun!","Written September 29, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Highlight of my trip. Definitely not to miss!,"With all the hype and people reviewing this place, I made sure to add this to my agenda while visiting Osaka. Even though the entrance ticket and express pass was quite pricey in my opinion I thought it was worth every penny. The studio definitely had a lot to offer and we basically stayed from morning till night (solid 11 hours).

We visited USJ recently, towards the end of September. I can honestly point out that the vibe between daytime and nighttime varies greatly due to the Halloween theme it has provided.

Even though we visited USJ on a Wendesday, the place was filled with people therefore express pass became a necessity item instead of a luxury therefore be sure to purchase the tickets while you book online through Klook (which was what I did). Given the duration we stayed, we had enough time to go on all the rides / performances we wanted to go at least once (except Minion Ride). Personally, the rides I enjoyed greatly was the Flying Dinosaur (av. 120mins wait) and The Harry Potter 4K ride (av. 100mins wait), not to be mistaken with Flight of the Hippogriff. (Both of which I used the express pass to go through).

We were fortunate enough to enjoy a couple rides that were only available during the Halloween season therefore I would recommend checking their official website before hand to see which ones are available on that period. The one I couldn't enjoy was ""Biohazard™: The Extreme."" This experience provides a handful of tickets and can only be picked up by their entrance. I didn't do my homework and ultimately missed this opportunity.

After 18:00 the venue became a lot more interesting. As soon as you hear the announcement that zombies / monsters / creatures will come out as a parade, the atmosphere was spectacular. All of a sudden, the environment became hauntingly entertaining. There were live performances that involved dancing, instrumental, singing and most entertaining of all, general interaction with the public. If you're looking to visit USJ, I highly recommend coming during the Halloween season!

Last but not least, I will share some parade photos only since it is not always available.",

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Prepare to queue!,"We visited in early September, midweek and apparently outside of school holidays but still packed especially with local teenagers. Long queues for popular rides especially Harry Potter Forbidden Journey and Jurassic Park Flying Dinosaur. Within half hour of opening the Harry Potter ride had a 2hr wait. Its probably worth considering the Express Pass if you’re particularly keen on these more popular rides (although it then makes it a pretty expensive day).
The Flying Dinosaur ride was closed for unscheduled maintenance, poor communication around if/when it would reopen was frustrating (“come back in 30mins for update” - it was shut for over 2hrs).
There’s limited shade for many of the queues so take hat/fan/sunscreen for hot summer days.
Some of the rides are showing their age (e.g. Jaws, Terminator 3D). All shows are in Japanese only, obviously harder to follow if you don’t speak the language but the action is still entertaining.
Hollywood Dream was good, Jurassic Park The Ride, Space Fantasy and Spider-Man were also worth doing. With hindsight we probably wouldn’t bother with the Flight of the Hippogriff or the Terminator show.
For most rides you can cut wait times considerably by taking the single rider queue. In some cases our wait time was reduced by 30mins or more and sometimes we got on the same ride together anyway.
Waterworld show was much better than Terminator (partly because the latter started >30mins later than scheduled, for no apparent reason).
Plenty of food offerings but what we saw looked pricey and not particularly appetizing, long queues around lunchtime and hard to find a table too. We had a big breakfast before we went then made it through the day with drinks bought from vending machines.",

We did this! Slightly cheaper, We skipped the insane heat, we skipped the crowds. Longest wait times for Minion Mayhem-and that was only 30 minutes. Jaws was a 20 minute wait, The Amazing Spider-Man was 20 minutes and the Jurassic Park ride, my partner walked straight in.
If there is just one person riding, we’d definitely recommend the single rider queue. Come 7.30/8 you can pretty much walk straight on in.
I’m surprised we got so many “popular” rides in, we had a sick time, and the Hogwarts Light show shouldn’t be missed!",

There are so many attractions in so many different parts of the park it is a non stop adventure. They even had a whole section for my 2 year old, then the other for the older kids as well. They have an all you can drink deal in restaurant which allows you to enjoy a cold beverage or a hot coffee at all times of the day while you are there. The shows are top notch, and they have so many the wait times are at a minimum.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Couldn't access Wizarding World,"I flew all the way to Japan to see the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. However, AFTER paying full price tickets and entering the park, there was a sign saying Harry Potter world is full and can only be accessed via a lottery ticket. I queued with hundreds of people and nobody won the HP lottery.
This should have been told to us BEFORE entering the park, ideally at the time of buying the tickets as HP was my only reason for going. Instead, they take customers' money and then forbid them from seeing most of the park. I've honestly never been so disappointed. Terrible problem with overcrowding and even worse way of dealing with it. Staff was rude, and told us literally to ""go away"" when we asked if there was any other way to access HP world that day. (e.g. buying an extra pass).
It's theft tbh as they refused to provide a service I paid a lot for, through no fault of my own.","Written September 3, 2019"

By your round trip train tickets before to avoid long queue.
There are lugguage storages and regular lockers inside the park. Use the one inside is recommended.
If money is not your concern or if you only have limited time to stay inside the park, get priority tickets instead as queuing time can be over 1 hour. But they let elderly and handicapped people to go first without getting priority tickets.
Read the time table of performance to avoid disappointment. They have light parade which you should f miss.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Not my thing. I think it is much too costly for value.,"I went there to hang out with some friends and because it is very famous.
Some 4D movies (we saw ~2 of them) and a water live show were really good;

I bought a basic adult ticket for 9000¥ (10000¥/90€, including transport to get there) which I find it very expensive though: long queueing times, everything (except fairground attractions included in ticket and the toilets) lead to spend more money: not just toys or food but practical things I would have expected to be free, eg. I had to charge my phone (my mistake). For that I had to go to some machines that make you pay, and that were not easy to find. charging it to 40% cost me 600¥ (6€).

But for those who like theme parks like this, a simple tip. Worth going when it’s raining because there are fewer people and queuing time is much shorter.","Written August 29, 2019"

A couple of surprises - Only one park - i have become used to two parks in Orlando. i was able to get to everything i wanted in one day - it helped that i had the Express Pass - though it still limited the use to one per ride (another surprise). Okay - last thought and i know i only speak English - some subtitles would have been greatly appreciated - many times i was watching a film or show that only had Japanese. i believe it would be a lot more fun (and understandable) if i could have had some English.

We visited USJ on a weekend. It was pretty crowded as it was also school holidays I guess. Luckily we pre booked our tickets and got the express pass as well.
Main attractions are Harry Potter, Minions, Spiderman and Jurasic World.
The staff were friendly and always are there to guide you thru the park.
Lots of attractions and shows in different parts of the park
I strongly recommend the express pass, as you will minimum wait for 60-90 minutes in a que for each ride.
To safe time do get the express pass.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Expensive but fun day out,"If you've visited any of the other Universal parks then you know what to expect here. Universal Japan has all the same rides, but you must buy the fast pass if you want to get on the most popular, otherwise expect to queue for up to two hours (which is no fun in 40 degrees). The park does feel very Japanese despite all the US trappings - it's spotlessly clean, the rides/parades/food stalls are staffed by super polite and efficient people and because it's visited by Japanese people in the main, it seems much calmer than most other theme parks we've visited. Try to eat outside of the usual lunch and dinner slots to avoid the crowds and take snacks (although there are numerous places to eat they are far more expensive then anything else we came across in our trip to Japan). It's a great day out and the park seemed to clear by about 6.30pm so consider coming later in the day if you want to get on more rides. The night time parade was our favourite and well worth staying for - check notice boards for timings. One last thing is that wifi is almost non existent, so use the paper map to get around rather than any app you might have heard about and check ride height restrictions in advance if you're travelling with children.","Written August 26, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Must buy the express pass!,We bought our tickets and express pass 7 on klook and enjoyed a day of hassle-free and queue-skipping rides! The express pass allowed us to zip through the 60-130 min queues for the valid attractions! One tip is to use the express pass for Hollywood Dream -The Ride instead of Backdraft as Backdraft accomodates a large number of people in one go! We were able to take most major and popular rides before the night even hit! Get the express pass if you can!,
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Liked it more than I thought I would!,"The interenet gives you access to knowledge like never before and my kid is proof of this! She saw one brochure at a travel show and from there it was Disney this, Unversal that. We'd agreed to go to one of the major theme parks and although we would later stay between the two Disney parks in Tokyo, we had a preference for Universal Studios. This visit may have been for our daughter, but we still had to deal with it and Universal appealed to both of us more.
You'll find Universal Studios towards the Harbour, a few stops down from Osaka station on the Yumesaki line. The stop you want is actualy called Universal City and is not right on the park, but a short walk through numerous resturaunts, bars and hotels. As we arrived, station staff were advising that visitors purchase return tickets immediately to avoid long queues. Do this! You won't regret it.
The park entrance is an open plaza with ticket booth, entry and lockers to the left and the Universal globe and fountain to the right for selfies. Another great tip here is that there are luggage lockers and toilets before the entry and there are also lockers once inside the park. Use the ones inside the park as once you leave the park, there is no re-entry. Seems a bit unfair but it's their park, thier rules. Entry for two adults and one child cost us around AUD$300. That includes standard rides in the regular queue. In hindsight, we shoud have chosen the Priority line tickets, as queues were as long as 90 minutes for some attractions. We also noted that some of those times were overstated, or the number of riders had reduced and the wait-time hadn't been changed. We had entered the park around 2pm on a wet day and it was still really busy. The park itself is broken up into serveral themed areas and you should make yourself aware of these with the park map or before you go. Some of these may just not be of interest, such as the Americana area was not interesting to us. The minions area was smashed with visitors and looong wait times and we nded up wandering to the Jurasic park area and onto the boat ride. Queue time stated 45 mins but it took us about 28 mins and we got to the front of the boat. Way cool! BTW, buy the overpriced 400yen plastic poncho from the vending machine. Those things served us for the whole day and were essential at the front of the boat! This is a fun ride. We did get stuck on one part for about 15 mins and a dinosaur peed in my ear, my daughter's favourite part of the ride, and it was really fun. Just wish I knew where the camera was as the Japanese father next to us popped a dab at the right time and made a very cool photo souvenir! As the lttle one was mostly too little for the really fun rides, we took her to snoopy land and the other kids areas. Just beware that some of these shut down their kids rides at 4pm, leaving you with one grumpy kid. But don't worry, there's plenty of other rides for them that are still going. Even the waterworld attraction shut early. For us, the best part was Harry Potter world. By 4pm, queues are shrinking and so are the crowds so 20 mins or less is the average wait times we found. Do the ride in Hogwarts, no I'm not going to spoil it, but just don't do the Butter Beer beforehand. It tastes alright but that stuf comes back to haunt you! I have to say that HP world make the visit for us. It's well planned and executed and presents realistic worl at twilight.
As we wandered towards the gate, I told the family I was going to do one decent scary coaster ride, with or without them. That was the Flying Dinosaur ride. I got on the car with three quite young Japanese guys I didn't know, we screamed and laughed our guts out, and got off to high-fives and the new found bortherhood of the Flying Dinosaur. Brilliant!!
It's hard to write about leaving as everything now had a dull taste to it. Good thing we had already bouth our return tickets! Now for a 39 min ride home to Kyoto...
Basically, go a little later, buy your return train tickets when you arrive, buy the priority tickets, use the lockers indise the park and have fun. When we tought about it, this was better entertainement value that a day at the Sydney Easter Show.","Written August 24, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Long waits,"While some of the rides were thrilling the waits were simply too long. Up to 75 minutes wait for a ride that was only a few minutes long. Given the summer heat, the waits were almost unbearable.

Also we had purchased express passes for some of the rides but my teenage children could not use the passes as they were above the size limit for those rides. We were not informed of the size limit at the time we purchased the express passes at the counter.

Some of the rides such as Jaws were simply outdated.","Written August 23, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,A wonderful 2-days in USJ!,"This is a detailed review and ideally I would have given a score of 4.5, as there are some issues. Ultimately my journey in USJ was so wonderful at the end that it is a very personal, 5-star rating.

First of all, I strongly recommend the 2-day pass (not express). If you're tight for time during your Japan stay, you can go for the 1-day express. My friend and I did a lot in 1-day without express (8:30-20:00), but it is impossible to do all of it without express. However, the reason I recommend 2-days is because, for me personally, my time in USJ felt like a lifetime. To be able to return for the second day really enhances your experience.

Second, definitely arrive early. I won't guarantee any gimmies if you do, because even at 8:30 there was a 50+ minute wait for the minion ride, which appeared to be the most popular ride during our 2-day visit. Though this is preferable to the 120 minutes wait during the day. Also, try to stay until the end. The park has a different feel at the night-time; looks beautiful; and when you reflect on the 12+ hours that have passed, you really do feel like you're a part of the place.

Third, beware of lunchtime! This is a big complaint that I have in USJ. Waiting for rides is one thing, but you can overcome this with a phone and battery bank, or a nintendo DS/handheld console. Waiting for food is, in my opinion, not acceptable. This is something they definitely need to address. We were there at the beginning of August, so lunchtime isn't just about eating, it's about shelter. You can smuggle in a couple sandwiches in the bottom of a deep bag, but in the end, you'll need a bite to eat at some point, and if you're doing a 8:30-20:00 stay, you're going to need a rest! I can't offer tips here, the diners were jam-packed anytime between 12:00-15:00. I'll I can say is - expect it.

Fourth and finally, do as much as possible! If you do the 2-days, definitely watch some of the parades, the water shows (minions and the stunt Waterworld show). Mix it up a little! The rides are fun, but there's plenty other attractions on offer. Some attractions are intended for kids and family, but the adults will still enjoy those attractions to!

Overall, in my 25-day trip across Japan, the 2 days spent in Osaka's Universal Studios Japan, is one of my favourite memories!","Written August 23, 2019"

If you only have limited time, can buy Universal Express Pass tickets which is super expensive. With this ticket a special queue line will be available.

Access to USJ with JR Osaka Loop Line stops at Nishikujo Station and then go with JR Yumisaki Line about 5 minutes to Universal City Station.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Family Day Out,"We spent the whole day at the park (12 hours) with our 2 daughters, had a great time, enjoying the rides at the different worlds and especially Harry Potter world. Language was not an issue for non Japanese speakers, however the queues for the rides were very long and therefore if you can afford the Express Passes they are worth it but very expensive.

Transport to the park was easy and we got to the park within 20 minutes form the center of Osaka. My biggest grip was there were very few bins around the park and you had to queue for everything from water at the vending machines to food at both restaurants and popup counters. Also there were very few places to get anything other than beer if you wanted an alcoholic drink.","Written August 14, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Good experience,"Been to Universal studio in the Month of Aug, it was raining and climate was pleasant.
Expect your bag to be frisked at the entrance due security reasons and you are not supposed to carry outside food. However there are plenty of staff and all carrying broad broad smile. Within no time you will find yourself inside the park.
It will be highly recommended to go for fast track pass unless you are willing to be in queue for minimum of 30+ plus minutes for many of the rides. I been there on weekend and expect the same on weekends and public holidays.
Rides are great but many of the shows that you get to see are purely in Japanese language.
Food is no big deal and there are plenty of joints. For those seeking veg food only veg pizza is available in certain joints.
Stay in the park till the end and your visit is incomplete till you witness bright, colourfull wonderful, Parade towards the park closing hours.","Written August 8, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Amazing day but 2 rude staff spoilt the experience,"Family group of 7 - 6 adults and an 11 year old. A truly amazing experience despite the language barrier. We enjoyed the shows where very little English is spoken - but that’s ok - we’re in Japan after all. However, two members of staff on the Hollywood Dream ride had the potential to ruin the whole day. Two separate incidents too. Four of us decided to do the singles line to speed things up. My 11yo daughter was fine with this and is a chilled kid. We decided that she’d go in the middle so an adult could be waiting for her. As she placed her bag in the locker at the side she was told she couldn’t and then directed to a full locker. Confused as she couldn’t see where to put her bag - she was shouted at. She then was instructed to put the bag where she was originally going to. She then got told to take something off her head. As she wasn’t wearing anything except a braid that is part of her hair (plaited in and tied back) she again was confused. She was shouted at again by this staff member- she left the ride quite upset.

Same ride - I was asked by a number of staff to remove a bandana prior to the ride. Having been on a previous one I was expecting this. I stated I would remove it at the bag locker and at least 3 staff members smiled and accepted this. I lost all my hair following treatment- it’s not a fashion statement- my hair has grown back super curly and is at a stage where it’s in between. I’m self conscious of this - but I also accept their rules. One staff member would not accept that I would take it off when I put the bag and other belongings that were still in my hand in the locker. He demanded I take it off there and then. I was still in the queue. I was so upset I completed the ride choking back tears.

We be tried to contact the park directly but as I’m not able to felt that it would be part of my review. Such a shame as other members of staff were amazing - server in Harry Potter world for example.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Pleasantly surprise but as expected not the cheapest,"Wasn't even on the 'maybe' list of things to do in Japan but so glad we went! Despite teaming with visitors the hospitality second to none! Haven't been to any similar but thought the attention to detail was second to none and as an adult there were a couple fantastic rides. We forked out for the express pass so not 100% sure whether standing in hour long cues would have rated such a positive review so def look at those if you can. If you are willing, the singles' cues are a great option for cutting time in the line if you are willing to go separately...HEAPS of movie trinkets to buy and loved my minion burger lol",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Just Superb !,"We went there as a family in golden week. It was very very crowded as expected but they somehow seem to have managed huge crowds superbly. We purchased express pass (which is very different from express pass in Disney).
The queues for small kids rides was much less so we were able to attend lot of rides there. The big rides had lot of queues (more than 2 hours) so unless you have express it gets tough.
This park is much more open than Disney so you don't feel that crowded. The eating options were also many here.","Written August 17, 2019"

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Mesmerizing,"The temple and the tori gates are amazing. While you have to deal with the crowds (based on the time of day you visit) which can take the charm away from this place, if you are patient and let the large groups pass you, you can enjoy it even more. Last part of the walk is a bit steep but nothing major. Must see and worth the visit","Written November 3, 2021"
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,One of my Favorites!,"The Fushimi Inari Shrine was probably my favorite one in Kyoto. It is a bit out of the way compared to some of the others, but well worth it. I rented bikes in Kyoto and there was a nice trail leading to the area. This shrine was so much fun to explore and it was massive. You can literally spend a half day here wandering the shrine and hiking. Of course, the highlight is the thousand Torri Gates. You can get incredible photos here. This shrine tends to get crowded even early in the day. I can't imagine what it is like during the height of tourist season.","Written September 17, 2021"
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Favorite part of our trip!,"This was by far my favorite attraction during the whole trip. Well as far as temples are concerned. Be prepared for a nice hike as it’s 12,00 steps to the top of Mt. Anari that whole place is just so stunning though.",
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,My favorite place in the whole of Kyoto,I love mountain hiking and this is the perfect place we go up in the mountain and see the beautiful Tory gates in the middle of the forest there are a lot of tourist but when you climb in above the mountain you will find yourself alone and you will be able to feel the holiness of the place,"Written September 1, 2021"
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Mesmerizing experience,"One of my favorites in Japan trip is this temple with hundreds of Inaris all along the hill taking you uptop. There are multiple stops along the way so you can plan where to stop and return instead of going all the way.

The walk up is not difficult and there are plenty of stopping points to take in the views and surroundings. We went very early just before 07:00hrs to avoid the crowds, which worked a treat. As you go to leave the shrine keep to the right and you pass a school and come to a lovely cafe on the side of a pond. We had breakfast here which was lovely.","Written August 14, 2021"

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,13 May 2017 visit Fushimi-Inari Temple in Japan,"""Fushimi Inari Taisha (伏見稲荷大社) is the head shrine of Inari, located in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, Japan. The shrine sits at the base of a mountain also named Inari which is 233 metres above sea level, and includes trails up the mountain to many smaller shrines which span 4 kilometers and takes approximately 2 hours to walk up.

Since early Japan, Inari was seen as the patron of business, and merchants and manufacturers have traditionally worshipped Inari. Each of the torii at Fushimi Inari Taisha is donated by a Japanese business. First and foremost, though, Inari is the god of rice.

This popular shrine is said to have as many as 32,000 sub-shrines (bunsha (分社)) throughout Japan."" ⛩⛩⛩","Written August 6, 2021"

Be prepared for a 2-3 hr excursion just for the hike through all the toriis - climb the stairs & hike through over a thousand vermilion torii shrine gates to the summit of sacred Mt Inari. Descend back to the Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine. We took frequent rest breaks while hiking upward. There are quite a few shops (for drinks, food, souvenirs, ice cream, etc), vending machines but maybe only 2 restroom areas along the hike. Best to get to the shrine & start the climb as early in the morning as possible...you’ll get wonderful photos before the crowds come. Majority of people wore masks for COVID precautions.",

we went away and had a quiet lunch off the bust streets.
then back we went.
muscled our way through the culinary gauntlet.
mad chaos is how it felt.
i had no idea when i choose to come here how busy it would be.
i'd seen pics of the colourful tori and wanted to see them.
we got carried along and entered the rows of tori, senbon and walked a bit and my husband said no more.
i managed to step out and snap a few pics with out folks in them.
and then we left.
the temple sits at the base of the inari mountain and there are numerous trails and small shrines that can be explored over a couple of hours.
there are 1000 tori, each one donated by a japanese business.

Foxes were seen as Inari's messengers and there are statues of them everywhere! Behind the Shrine you will find the tens of thousands of famous Torii gates. All donated by private individuals and companies whose names and dates are written on the Torii gate they have donated.

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Thousands of Torii Gates,"We came here on the afternoon of our first day in Kyoto and found this to be the most fascinating shrine that we visited during our two weeks in Japan. Dedicated to the Shinto God of Rice, Inari, the shrine features thousands of densely packed torii gates that provide a covered path up the mountainside. As we had limited time and it takes from 2-to-3 hours for a round-trip to the summit, we decided to hike for about 45 minutes and then return.

A stream of tourists joined us for the climb, many hindering our pace by posing for photos, which required us to stop and wait. Some of the gates, which are vermilion with black at the bottom, proved to be in bad condition with chunks of wood missing. In a few places, a pole had been removed for restoration. Small restaurants and souvenir stands appeared occasionally outside the pathway, along with viewpoints. Signs unexpectedly warned about the danger of monkeys and boars, but we never saw any animals except a domestic cat sitting on a tree stump.

Back at ground level, a wave of tourists poured toward us to begin the ascent. Many of them seemed to be with tour groups. None stopped to look at the shrine's main hall and Romon Gate here. They also ignored the statues of foxes, which reflect the belief that the animal is an Inari messenger.

The shrine is always open and no admission is charged. I think early morning would be a far better time to come than the afternoon when the area has a huge tourist volume. We got here via the Keihan Main Line, which has a Fushimi-Inari station., and then walked for about four minutes to reach the shrine.","Written September 28, 2020"

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Entering to a Magical World through Torii Gates,"We visited Fushimi Inari Shrine in the afternoon and the grand entrance from Senbon Torii was like entering a magical world. We enjoyed hiking through the thousands of bright red torii gates. There were many fox statues along the path, which regarded as the messengers and guardian spirits of the Inari Shrines. The whole pathway is torii-covered along the loop to the top of the mountain and it took around 2 hours to reach the summit. It was a truly mesmerizing experience. The path went through passing restaurants, viewpoints, and smaller shrines along the way to the top of the hill. We could get some brilliant images of torii gates without other people in them. The view of the sunset at the top of the hill made an everlasting memory and this was one of the amazing journeys we encountered in Kyoto.","Written June 22, 2020"

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Bring your climbing shoes,"Even with the crowds, and yes there probably will be crowds, at least at the base of the shrine, the Fushimi Inari experience is quite magical. What makes the Japanese shrines so interesting is the active participation that still goes on today, and that you can be a part of it after learning the proper protocol. The gates did not disappoint. And while I thought there were only several rows of them, turns out there’s a whole mountain of them! And what a climb it was. It definitely was a hike up a mountain, but truly worth it once we reached the summit. Just bring a bottle of water, take your time, wear comfortable shoes for walking up steps, and you can do it! Definitely worth summiting if you have the chance. But if you don’t feel like hiking, there are plenty of gates to walk through at the base of the shrine. Just know the higher you go, the less people there are to take in the magic of the mountain.",
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Get past the crowds!,"To get the best experience here, I'd highly suggest hiking up to the summit and back. You'll escape the insane crowds at the base, and find yourself having a very peaceful walk through this beautiful shrine.

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Exhausting and beautiful,"Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine is a must do for visitors to Kyoto to walk upward ever upward via the winding path through hundreds of Tori gates is an amazing experience, stopping along the way to take in the prayer stations some with dozens if not hundreds of small tori placed as votive offerings.
We arrived late in the afternoon and had to almost sprint up the hill as the evening darkness closed in on us, but then the lights come on giving the pathway a surreal air as the light casts its shadows through the Tori Gates.

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,A wonderful place to visit but go early and prepared for a good walk,"The Fushimin Inari-Taisha Shrine lived up to expectations but as one of the more famous sights in Japan we thought we should try to avoid the crowds by going early so we got an early train from Kyoto and aimed to get there around 7am. If you decide to visit I would strongly recommend you do the same because it was worth the early start.

The start of the complex is only a short walk from the rail station and begins with the large and very obvious shrines of Fushimi Inari-taisha. The temptation was to stop here and start exploring but the goal was to walk up the hill on the 4km path through a seemingly endless procession of bright red vermilion Tori gates so we headed to the left of the large shrine at the entrance and began our ascent up to and through the gates.

It is a beautiful place and a wonder through a camera viewfinder but finding a stretch without a stranger in the frame was only possible because we went early and the difference when we were making our way down was amazing. The people who set off only an hour or so after us had almost no chance to see it as we had and as it appears in the travel guides and by mid morning it had become a tunnel of people.

The shrine was originally dedicated by the Hata family in the 8th Century and the bright vermilion tori have been erected and dedicated by individuals and communities over a long period. As you begin to walk through them look back and you will see the black painted dedications on the side facing up the slopes of Inari-san.

There are plenty of small shrines and four or five larger shrines along the route often with stone foxes that people have occasionally adorned with small bright neck scarves and others are thronged with a multitude of miniature foxes arranged in ranks and offering great photographic opportunities. The fox is thought to be a messenger to the god and where you see one apparently carrying a key this is symbolic of the key to a rice granary.

The track itself comes to form a loop so staying on what looks like the main route will eventually lead you back to a spot you recall from the journey up. We only encountered one real side track and it was fortunately very short. On the other hand what isn't so obvious is the top!

There is a large shrine of clustered stone monuments at the summit and shortly beyond it you will find you are consistently descending. We first thought we had simply passed over a ridge on the way up and carried on a little way passing a few people who had clearly done the same thing and had turned to make their way back up, something we did a few minutes later.

Our visit to the larger shrine near the entrance waited until the end and by then it had already attracted crowds but we were in no doubt that to appreciate not only the long tori enclosed track up the hillside but something of the peaceful atmosphere and the freshness of the early morning here made our early start a really good decision.

If you do the same though it would be worthwhile taking both a bottle of water and some kind of light snack to eat along the way. There are very few places to eat once you start and a couple more that sell drinks and ice cream but when we visited we found these didn't open until 9 or even 10am. With more people on the ascent by then these were also quickly getting busy as we were on our way back to town. The complex itself is free to explore and there are no restrictions on photography beyond the usual courtesies if you want to include someone you don't know in your shot.

To sum up this is a free site very worth visiting for it's history and beauty, easily reached from Kyoto and one that definitely merits an early start. There are few opportunities for food and drink along the way so it would be a good idea to pack a little something along with some water and you are basically climbing a hill so if you have mobility problems it might not be very accessible much beyond the start.
I hope this is helpful to you on your visit and very much hope you enjoy it as much as we did.","Written April 23, 2020"

When you have reached the end of the 1st section of gates, there is a non-descript dirt trail veering off semi-steeply to your right - it leads to a small shrine and lovely bamboo grove 3 minutes away - worth a visit.

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Magical place,"Tranquil and peaceful place with magical lighting at night.

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Don’t let rain stop you!,"We went on a day that it was raining and took an umbrella each. It was well worth it!! It was not overcrowded so plenty of opportunities for photos without other tourists in the background. It takes about 2.5 - 3 hours to get to the top of mt. Inari and back with a quick stop for a drink and souvenir shops. The train station is practically across the road and most people are heading there so follow the crowd and you’ll find it. Stop number 6 on the trail has an awesome view and a pit stop cafe/drinks/icecream. This is where most people stop and go back down and I wouldn’t have regretted turning back at this point but we pushed on to the top, which included lots of stairs, and at the very top there was not a designated good view spot, but a large collection of shrines. There was a small building that I don’t know if it opens to the public or not as it wasn’t open.
The trail of tori gates and shrines really left you in awe and the forest was a refreshing contrast from the cityscape.
My legs were jelly once we started descending (from the top) and I’d consider myself to be of average/above average level of fitness, which is why I think stop 6 on the trail is a good spot to turn back if I did it again",
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Great shrine in south-east part of Kyoto,"We were there in the evening (about one hour before sunset, so the place definitely was not overcrowded. Orange/almost red Tori gates are absolutely unforgettable views. The whole shrine area is rather big. Tori gates lead to thetop of the hill, where there are a few platforms allowing for great views on Kyoto, other surrounding hills and even Osaka. Additionally, everywhere are everywhere stone fox statues, as the shrine is devoted to deity of foxes, which are the messengers observing people. Very nice place, with some quiet, contemplative places, especially when not overcrowded. Absolutely ""must see"" in Kyoto.",

Apart from the rows of Torii gate, there are also other shrines in the complex. The highlight of the shrine is the rows of torii gates though. Along the main path, there are around 1000 gates, all coloured in bright Vermilion colours. Some of the gates have inscriptions, that people have carved in. The current structures date from the late 15th century. We were there late in the evening and dark and gives a different perspective and colours. You can hike up to the top of the mountain but it takes 2 hours to get there. Naturally, we could not do so. There are also many monkeys around and they can be quite nasty.

It was still crowded enough with locals and quite a lot of tourists despite all the virus hype, so I can’t imagine how much busier it is during normal tourist season! It is better to visit early in the morning. In one part of the shrine, there are small local stores, one of which sold boiled eggs- a must try!

Officially the place is open till 5 pm. But in fact, it is safely accessible any time, so I recommend to come AFTER 5 pm.

Firstly, the place has a great lighting around all the temples 24/7 so you will see them well even when it’s dark - I added the pics here.

Secondly, it is not crowded at all in the evening, so you can enjoy your privacy on the nature side.

Thirdly, you will still be able to make it to all the suggested walks.

Have fun!",

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Thousands of Torris,"The Fushimi Inari Taisha is the head shrine of Inari, the god of rice, sake and prosperity and patron of business, merchants and manufacturers. The shrine is at the base of Mount Inari and includes many smaller sub shrines.
At the shrine’s entrance we saw the Romon (tower) Gate, which is the main gate, and was built in 1589 thanks to donations from the samurai warlord and ruler of Japan, Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
We noticed stone statues around the main shrine that appeared to be unusual looking dogs. There were dozens of these in various poses. We learned that they were foxes. Foxes or kitsune in Japanese are regarded as the messengers of the gods. Some of the stone foxes even had keys in their mouths. Those were the keys to the rice granaries which they were protecting.

The main attraction at this stop are the thousands of torii shrine gates. There are more than 11,000 of them. Each of the famous torii shrine gates has been donated by an individual or a Japanese business in the hope of receiving good luck and fortune. The name of the donor is inscribed in black ink on the back of each gate. The cost of donating the torii starts around $400,000 JPY ($4,000 USD) for a small sized gate and increases to over 1,000,000 JPY ($10,000 USD) for a large gate.

Most tourists get stuck at the entrance taking their selfies but the crowds are wild here and you cannot get a photo of you without 10 other people walking in it. But if you continue on the walking trail and dont turn back to the entrance at the first trail (which is about a 10 minute loop) but continue up the mountain, they still have the orange wood structures the whole way up and there were times where we didnt see anyone else for 5 whole minutes!

Located directly outside the Inari train station (JR line, 2 stops from Kyoto). We got there early around 7.30am there was maybe 2 other groups ahead of us. Best time to get some unrestricted photos of the Tori gates. Now be warned it is alot of stairs so be prepared for a workout. We were up and down in 1.5hrs and we weren't rushing, stopping alot for photos. Once at the bottom again there was a small food market setting up. We stayed here for breakfast and walked the market. Souvenirs are available from here too. Overall, loved it. Great morning activity. Go early, the hikes pretty and peaceful","Written February 13, 2020"
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Mysterious and Magical,"We arrived at Fushimi Inari around 6pm, so it's not yet that dark, but not really light as well... a twilight of sorts and it was magical (check the photo). I recommend visiting at around this time as there's not much crowd, plus the view is so, shall we say ""instagram-worthy"". You can actually feel that this a holy place. Japan has many beautiful temples, and we've visited quite a few, but this is probably one of the best we've seen.",

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,"Crown jewel of Kyoto attractions, the beauty just goes on and on","My absolute favorite attraction in Kyoto, and maybe all of Japan. When you enter Fushimi Inari, you are greeted with the tori gates with a big orange building with shinto foxes on both sides. This is the iconic picture of it, and one might be forgiven for thinking this is where it ends.

However the beauty of Fushimi Inari lies beyond the entrance, and moving past it to the other temples on the long set of stairs. Neither me or my wife are hikers, but we absolutely loved going up Fushmi Inari as we kept being greeted by ever more imposing thousands of tori gates. There are multiple temples along the way to the summit, which in itself are beautiful and worth stopping and paying homage. You will keep seeing the beautiful fox statues all across the hike too. Unfortunately our feet were too sore from all the walking in Kyoto, Osaka that we stopped a little bit short of the summit and never reached Mt. Inari.

At the base and even along the hike, there are food stalls selling local food items. We didn’t grab a bite, but if you’re adventurous it could be worth a try. With it’s free price label, I’d rank it Kyoto’s must-visit attraction and one of the “shouldn’t miss” places",
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Missed it,"As we walked out from Fushimi Inari Station, we followed the crowds and took some pics of the big lovely temple in front of the station, with its majestic torri gate.
Then, we walked along a small street with many quaint Japanese houses and came across a food section where many varieties of food were sold.
After enjoying some food and resting, we walked on. We failed to find the entrance to the orange torri gates and Shrine. We tried asking some locals but were not successful with the directions given.
In the end, we gave up because we visited Arashiyama Bamboo Forest that morning and our legs were so tired.
We immediately regretted not persevering as we entered the JR train to return to Kyoto, but it was too late. Beats us how we could've failed to find it when so many others mention its proximity to the station.
Anyway, we told ourselves, this would be a good reason to come back to Kyoto again, to visit Fushimi Inari Shrine! But we must be fully prepared with really clear directions on how to reach it.","Written February 5, 2020"

In fact the vermillion torri gate is the icon of Japan. On the way, there are many fox statues across the shrine grounds. We climbed up to Mt Inari which is 233m above sea level. It was just another 15 minute walk before reaching the peak, but we abandoned it as it was getting dark and there were not many visitors going up. So we decided to descend and walk back to Keihan Inari Station. It’s a good walk with fresh air and some beautiful scenery along the way.

Take some water with you as you can buy water and other soft drinks near the top cost a bit more money because you’re quite limited on what you can buy at that stage.

You could even buy a shrine mini replica which the sellers will put the date that you came with your name I believe as well but I can’t say about the name as I am going by when I bought it 10 years ago but they are still selling the same articles.

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,A temple like no other,"It's said that this is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Japan, and I can believe it: we were there on a cold day in December and the place was absolutely swarming. I hardly dare contemplate what it must be like in the high season.

However, don't let that put you off. The temple complex covers the whole mountainside, and as you go up the mountain, the crowds fall away. The vast bulk of visitors only visit the lower part of the complex and of those who go further, most stop at the saddle where there is a great view of Kyoto, and a small restaurant. If you climb to the top (about a 15 minute walk from the saddle) and then take the loop path that leads you back to the saddle, you can enjoy an uncrowded walk along the forest path, dotted with those iconic orange Torii gates.

Got the JR line from Kyoto centre and the entrance was just over the road. At night this place no doubt has a very different feel, all lit up by lanterns. The crowds had almost vanished and just a handful of people were making the walk up and down the hill through the gates. We went to the very top (lots of steps, some effort required) and I felt it was well worth it. Heard monkeys in the forest, saw plenty of joru spiders on their webs, and met a bunch of friendly feral cats.

The place itself is really nice and as majestic as the photos seen. What we discovered was, the higher you go, the thinner the crowds get. Most of the visitors are at the start of the gates. They stop to take photos and such. There are many sections and the further one goes, the lesser people and plenty of photo opportunities (without having strangers in your photo).",

Along the way you’ll see stands of tall bamboo, and many smaller shines at regular intervals. There’s birds, insects, plants, and frogs along the path to keep you engaged. There’s also a woodworking workshop with a small waterfall.

The road trail turns sharply and narrows up the steepest part to the summit. If you’re lucky the lady at the shrine at this point will give the kids an ice lolly! BEST!

There’s no real view from the summit, but you start your descent down the path everyone else comes up (so you get to see everything they do). Enjoy the little shops on the way down (buy a unique tenugui cloth as a momento - and to mop the sweat from your brow!). And there is a gorgeous view of Kyoto 15 mins down the path.

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Where is good Shrine near Tokyo.,"Hello Guys. I lived in Tokyo about 40 years.

I just recommend around Tokyo Shrine.

Actually Maiji Jingu and Ysukuni jinnja are not Real Japanese God.

Meiji jingu enshrined is about 100 years ago Meiji Emperor.
And Yasukuni Jinja is killed in war.
But I recommended Meiji Jingu if you want get feel ""What is Shrine"" coz good atmosphere. Good sightseeing place.

You should go to ISE JINGU if you wanna see Real Japanese God.
This is real Japanese God of God in there.
Their history is about 2000 years

But Very far from Tokyo.
I recommend go to HIE JINJA at Akasaka Tokyo.
This shrine is very historical. About 800 years

Each Japanese shrine has meaning.
Example
Shrine A : Good for health.
Shrine B : Good for study.
Shrine C : Aviation God.
etc

You should find meaning before chosen go to Japanese Shrine .

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,A world so full of nature you'd swear you were in Tokyo,"東京を代表する神社の一つ。伊勢神宮のように鬱蒼とした森に囲まれ、晴れた日には燦燦と降り注ぐ木漏れ日が気持ちいい。これが人工の森だとは思わせない程に、自然環境のサイクルに委ねられ、人の手は最小限しか入っていない。神社の参拝をしなくても、散歩コースとしてピッタリなスポットだと思う。
山手線を挟んですぐ東側が原宿の商店街であるため、神社の境内の東側はやや人の喧騒が感じられる。しかし社殿に進むにつれてその喧騒は薄れ、本当に都内なのかと思うくらいに自然の音で満たされる。休日や年末年始は多くの人が訪れるため、明治神宮の静寂な雰囲気を味わうには平日の早朝がお勧めだ。
社殿をはじめ、鳥居などの様々な建物は、質素であり典型的な神社の建築構造であるが、それゆえに過度な主張をすることなく神社という聖域に見事に溶け込んでいるように見える。東京を代表するスポットではあるが、あまり固くなりすぎず肩の力を抜きゆったりと境内を歩いてみるといいかもしれない。

The Meiji Shrine is one of the most famous shrines in Tokyo. Like Ise Jingu, it is surrounded by a dense forest, and on a sunny day, you'll feel the brilliant sunlight filtering through the trees. You'll be surprised to learn that this is a man-made forest. There is minimal human care in the forest, and everything is left to the cycle of the natural environment. Even if you don't visit the shrine, it is a perfect spot for a walk.
As the east side of the shrine is the shopping district of Harajuku, you will feel a bit of the hustle and bustle of people as you walk along the east side of the shrine grounds. However, the hustle and bustle fades away as you proceed to the shrine building in the center of the grounds. You will feel so filled with the sounds of nature that you will wonder if you are really in Tokyo. Since many people visit the shrine on holidays and during the year-end and New Year holidays, early mornings on weekdays are recommended to enjoy the quiet atmosphere of Meiji Shrine.
The shrine main hall, torii gates, and various other buildings are simple and typical of the architectural structure of a shrine, but because of this, they seem to blend in perfectly with the sanctuary of the shrine without being overly assertive. Although it is one of the most popular spots in Tokyo, it would be a good idea to walk around the shrine grounds in a relaxed manner without being too rigid.","Written January 2, 2021"

During this period, Japan became a modern state. The Shrine is surrounded by Yoyogi Park which was partially constructed for the 1964 Olympics.
It's a short walk from the Harajuku station and you'll see the massive wooden torii gates.
Many events take place at Meiji Shrine throughout the year. If you happen to be there at the beginning of the year, there is a ceremony dedicated to sumo wrestling which takes place during the first week of January. You will see the sumo wrestlers receiving purification. You can probably see it on TV but if you are there at the time, you may see the Yokozuna up close.

The buildings and grounds are really special...as is the massive collection of sake barrels that you pass on your way in...some of them are works of art!

I was privileged enough to see a marriage ceremony going on too...it was lovely.

I don't think anyone should go to Tokyo and not visit here!

We took a stroll through the lovely man-made forest until we reached the shrine. It was quite a humbling place to be, and I appreciated that there were signs in English explaining how to show respect and perform rituals correctly (for example, the hand washing). We also paid the 1000 yen per person to visit the inner garden, which includes a stroll around a lake. We did not see flowers because of the season.
However, when we were leaving around 10:00, a steady stream of tourists was making their way through the park. I think our experience would have been very different if we arrived with them.

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Hands down - best experience in Tokyo,"I really loved this shrine - not joking when I say that it's the best experience I had in Tokyo. The shrine is in the city, but between its location on the hill and the long walk up the path to get there, by the time you get to the shrine it's almost as though you've been transported farther away from the rest of civilization than you really are.

This is definitely, definitely worth a visit. I'd highly advise going early to avoid the crowds and really get a chance to experience that walk and the shrine at its most serene.","Written October 20, 2019"
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Quite moved,"I find it to be the case at many shrines and temples in Asia that they are not really set up for tourists--they are often crowded with people, but there's very little translation of what you are seeing. This shrine is no exception. However, there is a seriousness and a reverence here that many shrines I have visited lack, and I think part of that is that to get here, you must walk through the most peaceful, wild gardens. You feel calm but invigorated by the time you arrive at the shrine. There were many tourists there--the World Cup was on--but they all seemed to behave a little better than you might expect. It was lovely. There's this couple of trees tied together by ropes representing eternity of marriage and of family. I stood under it and was quite moved as I looked up into the branches that have sort of woven themselves together over the years. I looked around, and I was surrounded by people, but I felt like I was experiencing a moment alone. It was awesome. There was a wedding that day--a really lovely thing to see.","Written October 19, 2019"

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Wonder Off from the Crowds,"After spending several days squeezing into subway trains, strolling along the neon lit alleys of Shinjuku and fighting through the hordes of Shibuya Crossing, visiting Meiji Temple was a welcome repast. At my daughter’s urging to see something cultural, we decided to visit Meiji Temple.

From the Tokyo Station, Google offered several recommended transit routes. I decided to take what appeared to be the most direct route to the temple. After exiting the subway station in a residential neighborhood, we followed a path by a horse stable and what looked like an isolated dead-end street. There was nothing that appeared to be a tourist site or a temple. We had visited Asakusa Temple the day before and fought through thousands of tourists to visit one of the most commercialized religious sites in the world. There was nothing that appeared to resemble a similarly popular tourist site. We followed an elderly woman through a path into a park located at the end of the block and discovered one of the most serene places I’ve been. Beyond a small guard shack there was what appeared to be an archway one would expect at a temple. Believing that we were on the right path we proceeded through a beautiful tree lined pathway with open fields and few other travelers. Although we had not yet come across a temple, out of curiosity we continued on. Finally, we came across some fellow visitors heading in the opposite direction who confirmed that we were on the right path to the temple. I felt that we were on a pilgrimage.

We finally came across the Temple and now scores of visitors. We realized that we had entered the Temple from the back though a less traveled route and now were amongst throngs of tourists. The Temple is a traditional large courtyard with a shrine where devotees could make offerings. This is a working religious center where there are several buildings dedicated to Shinto religious practitioners. There isn’t much to see at the temple itself but wander through the park surrounding the temple and the trip is well worth the journey. If you arrived at the Temple from the Harajuku/Shibuya entrance, do not get discouraged by the crowds, exit through the back of the Temple and explore the park away from the throngs of tourists, literally bus loads and bus loads of tourists. However, if you want to spend a day away from the concrete, multi story shopping complexes and crowds of people, the park is a lovely way to spend the day.

There is a very modern visitors center with a café, rest rooms, and a full service restaurant. We stopped at the café and had a snack. The food served at the café was surprising very good and very inexpensive. They offer a full range of Japanese food from soba to curry rice and pizza.

Get away from the crowds and explore the park grounds. Serene and beautiful.",

It actually worked out nice. Bring bug spray as this time of year its humid and the mosquitos are out, even in the middle of the day!
The temple itself is beautiful, especially the large wooden arches at each entrance. It was a nice change to see the natural wood and not the brightly painted orange arches that are so popular at every shrine in Japan.

Take a few moments to enjoy the 39 foot high main gate or Torii--it is made from 1,500 year old Hinoki Cypress trees. We also enjoyed the barrels of both sake and burgundy that had been donated to the shrine--great for a picture. From what I understand, the trees that are now part of the 170 acre complex were donated by people from all throughout Japan. Check out my photos for more details.",
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Mediocre...,"This shrine is right in the middle of the city but located in a forest-like garden full of tall trees.

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Oasis in the middle of Tokyo,"We’d seen a lot of shrines by the time we visited. Pleasant as the Torri gates and buildings were, they’re not as impressive as Nikko for example, however the park and overall setting is a lovely recess from the hustle of the city. I’m not a Buddhist so can’t comment on the shrine from a religious perspective.",
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Fresh air in the city,"It was good 10-15 minutes walk from the subway. The shrine is surrounded by the forested park, it was really refreshing to explore around the park in the midst of the bustling city life.

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,170 acre forested shrine near Harajuku Metro Station.,"We took the Ginza Line from our 'b' Shimbashi Tokyo Hotel with 1 transfer to the Harajuku Metro Station. Crossing the bridge, we noted the 1964 Yoyogi National Gymnasium (1964 Olympics) then made our way to the 1st torigi arch marking the south entrance to this 1926 shrine. It opened to a wide pedestrian lane through the quiet 100 year old forest for 1 km, passing the odd Burgundy/Sake Barrel displays, then winding to the 2nd Grand Torigi Arch (40'H x 56' W utilizing 1500 year old cypress trees from Taiwan) to the 3rd torigi arch fronting the 2 story Main Gate to the Meiji Shrine Compound.
Arriving at 10 AM, we joined other tourists, locals, and 3 guided tour groups enjoying this serene natural atmosphere in the middle of Tokyo. We used the clean restrooms on the return to the metro.",

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Hot Day in Tokyo,"We were somewhat overwhelmed by the heat so were unable to enjoy this visit as fully as we would have liked. The group guide explained a lot of the various meaning and customs along the route including the purification process needed to enter the shrine itself. Most of our group did not go inside the shrine, but you were able to observe believers that entered the shrine for their blessing. Huge shade trees were present throughout the short walk leading back to the shrine.","Written August 5, 2019"
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Peace when everything else keeps moving.,"We found the city of Tokyo to be an even moving hustle of people and business, especially after the fun and madness of Shibuya crossing. Walking through the massive Tori Gate into Yoyogi park surrounding the shrine was a gentle slide into a green calm. Tourists thinned out as we got closer to the temple and we passed small side gardens, now closed, that we wish we'd be around earlier to explore them. A second enormous Tori gate announces your arrival to the Meiji Shrine and you are entered into the grounds of the shrine itself. We saw a lot of shrines over this trip and you get a little ""shrined out"" however the majesty of Meiji remained with us and cemented itself as our favorite. We performed the ritual washing of the hands (some wash their mouth out as well) as an act of respect before proceeding into the shrine proper. One inside, it opens itself to you and shows the grandeur of it's size. Stop on the edge and wait for a few minutes, take it all in, feel the timber that surrounds you and see the construction while the sweet smell of cedar wood and incense. A spiritual moment? Maybe... but for me, I really enjoy traditional timber construction and craftsmanship, along with the tactile sensations you get from them. What can I say, it's my bag! From there, move into the main courtyard and up to the actual shrine and burial place of Empower Meiji, the 122nd Emperor of Japan and the man who modernized the nation.
I feel the shrine really is a cultural must-see for Tokyo visitors. There are information boards all around describing the emperor and his rule. The shrine itself is a beautiful thing to behold and like us, you will want to buy one or the prayer boards (500 yen), write a prayer on it and place it on the hanger for the priests to present and offer the next day. You can also purchase any number of small charms for whatever luck you want. This is a fun think and it gives you some unique souvenirs. They may be a little pricey but if funds go to the upkeep and maintenance, I’m cool with that. Toilets abound through the park and pathways and there is a large cafe/restraint complex with souvenir shop. Good shop for traditional quality items over tacky fun ones.
Getting there is easy, either by walking up from Shibuya like we did or getting off at Harjuku, right on the park entrance. Come early or late as it appears the park gets busy in the main part of the day. If you are in Tokyo for some cultural satisfaction, this really is a must.",
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Breathing tradition,"A corner of great peace and serenity in a modern and fast metropolis.
The Meiji shrine It is mainly a beautiful Oasy of peace and tranquility especially during the days of the week when it is not crowded with tourists. A beautiful forest surrounds the sanctuary erected in honor of the emperor of the Meiji dynasty.

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Must do in Tokyo,"This place is stunning! We went on a weekday morning and it wasn’t too crowded. The walk to the shrine is shaded and peaceful.

We were lucky to observe a ceremony going on inside, very moving. This is undoubtedly a highlight of our visit to Tokyo.",

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,The serenity of Japan in the middle of Tokyo,"This is a wonderful Shrine and Gardens in central Tokyo near Shibuya Station. We came through the other entrance and worked out way through the Gardens and Shrine. Keep in mind no outside food or drink is allowed in and a guard is at the gates to be sure of that. But there is a place you can get a snack and drink once inside. There a number of water fonts throughout the gardens. They are there to express respect and not specifically religious beliefs as I understand it. Approach the font and rinse your left hand in the water, then your right hand, then cup the water in your hand and rinse your mouth, then rinse your left hand again. Use normal hygiene so as not to contaminate the water, the dipper or the water you rinse in your mouth. It may sound complicated but watch a few locals do it before you jump in and it's a great picture moment while you are there. Continue walking through the gardens and get to the temple in the center. There you can pay your respects by dropping a coin in the slot and praying or remembering loved ones. Again, watch the locals to see how to do it properly. Weave your way past the wine casks. You can read about why they are there. Around the same area there is a private garden you can pay a few dollars to walk through if you are so inclined. When you get to the other end of the gardens you are dropped off in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Shibuya where you can eat and do some high end shopping.","Written July 27, 2019"

The pair of sacred Camphor trees in the forecourt are gorgeous. One was planted in memory of the Emperor who died in 1912, the other for the Empress who passed in 1920. They are two trees tended to look like one, a beautiful sentiment.

They do charge you 500 yen for admission in the gardens, but this was a lovely walk at one of the most beautiful gardens I have ever seen with different blossoms at each season of the year.

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,a must-see on any visit to Tokyo,"my 18 y/o daughter and i spend a couple of hours here, and the grounds and shrine itself, along with the cafe area, were all lovely and peaceful. We even got to see a wedding procession while we were there. Please don't miss this lovely area.

I would recommend that tourists keep in mind that this should be a place for quiet conversations only, and to be respectful in your photo taking etc.","Written June 15, 2019"
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,"Nice Range of Sights, Not just Temples",We were there on a Sunday and saw four wedding processions. It was interesting- certainly busy with weddings. There are a range of buildings with the main temple being quite simple. There are nice walking paths in the gardens also and it is quite peaceful. It is a bit of a walk but you can also visit the hip young shopping area where you can see the weird and wonderful colourful Japanese youth.,
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Go early for less of a crowd,"We were here right around 10 AM and it wasn't too crowded. We started our morning very early at the nearby park and spent a lot of time strolling around and watching the adorable dogs play in the dog park. After killing some time, we headed to Meiji Jingu and as I said, it wasn't too crowded around 10 AM. I'm sure it gets more crowded the later it gets. It's set in a very pretty area with a lot of trees surrounding it. Even though you're right in the middle of a city, it has a magic about it that feels quite secluded and almost like you're in the mountains.","Written June 13, 2019"
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Favorite place in Tokyo,"Walking through the Torii gate at the entrance to the park removes you from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. There is quite a long walk to the shrine itself but it is through a forest of greenery. It makes your visit much more enjoyable than Senso-ji which is too crowded to enjoy (in my opinion). There is a lovely smaller garden called the Inner Garden that is also quite beautiful. An admission is charged for that part of the garden but not the main shrine area.

We ate a light lunch at the cafe by the entrance. It was a great place with delicious food and fun people watching.

Would definitely recommend this oasis in the middle of Tokyo.","Written June 11, 2019"

Japan,Yokohama Minato Mirai 21,"Many things here were once the first in the world... Tower, wheel, escalator.","Yokohama unlike Tokyo has a pronounced city center - Minato Mirai 21. ""Minato Mirai"" means ""harbor of the future"". So if you are already here, consider the future has already come. The futuristic area was created on the site of the former shipyard of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the railway station. The mayor of Yokohama, Ichio Asukata put forward this idea back in 1965. The path is not close to the idea to implementation. Construction began only in 1983 and is still in progress. The main landmark of the area and Yokohama's whole is called... Landmark Tower. I'm catching on. Tautology. Once the first tall building in Japan was built in 1993. The Landmark Tower has been ranked number 2 since 2012. Tokyo towers don't count. These are structures, not buildings.The Landmark Tower has an observatory on its 69th floor called the Sky Garden. The climb to the once fastest Elevator in the world will take 45 seconds. That's what the guidebooks say. It took us 38 seconds. Upstairs there is a bar, a gift shop and the best views of Yokohama. Shopping center Landmark Plaza waits for you downstairs.Queen's Towers, the neighbours of Landmark Tower, have many floors also. Several showrooms of car companies are scattered around the area. Chief of them is Nissan. As you know, its headquarters are here in Yokohama. Other entertainment is nearby. This is Cosmo world Park with a giant Ferris wheel, which used to be the largest in the world. There is no entrance fee to the Park, some attractions cost 300-800 yen each. The most romantic attraction of Minato Mirai is right there. This is training ship Nippon Maru (translated as ""Japanese ship"") set out in dry dock in 1984 and converted into a Museum. Yokohama port Museum is nearby. Admission: 400 yen for either museum, 600 yen for both. If the Museum itch has not passed, you can visit an unusual Museum, which you will not find, for example, in Europe. Cup Noodles Museum is located here on the island 100 meters from the Ferris Wheel. Here you can prepare your own ramen, make your own design packaging for noodles, etc. Each time paying an extra fee in addition to the entrance ticket of 500 yen.",

There are a few museums in the area, nice to walk along the waterfront that is very neat and tidy , it has been well done. The huge wheel is there to see with the time on it at the top , very handy. When you get to the harbour the views are great and there is a nice floating restaurant there called Pier 21.
From there look back to the city and view some very impressive buildings.
This is a modern area but also with old history, take note of two big water pumps that were brought from London England in the 1890s to pump water when the docks were being built , read the history there.

Japan,Yokohama Minato Mirai 21,Lots to see and do here!,"Built on the old Mitsubishi shipyard (a couple of the yard's drydocks are preserved) and a railyard, this is now the central business district of Yokohama with a huge office building (the Landmark Tower), convention center (Pacifico Yokohama), museums, shopping centers, amusement park, hotels, restaurants, etc. It is a well laid (planned actually) complex that balances all of these disparate parts beautifully (from functional and aesthetic viewpoints). We have been here many times over the past 20 years and always have enjoyed the energy of the place, not the mention the views, etc.

The Intercontinental is certainly the hotel of choice with its spectacular views of the harbor beyond, but the Pan Pacific is also very nice and is more closely connected to the shopping areas and the big office tower - we've stayed at both several times. If you can't find a restaurant (or two or three) to your liking, then you must be doing something wrong. When not eating and sleeping, there is always something to do - although we often enjoy simply walking around and looking at the activity in the harbor or watching the people enjoying themselves.","Written November 19, 2017"

1. Landmark Tower - beautiful view of Minato Mirai and it's surroundings
2. Cosmo World Ferris Wheel - you wont miss it and it looks beautiful at night.
3. Yamashita Park - A beautiful place for a nice stroll to enjoy the sea breeze/view, next to Yokohama Chinatown and Motomachi Shopping Street. (Motomachi-Chukagai Station)
4. Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse - unique shops and restaurants. Again, looks beautiful at night.
5. Yokohama Port Osanbashi - Take a 20 mins walk from Minato Mirai Station here for a nice stroll and amazing view of Minato Mirai 21. Highly recommended!
6. Loads of shopping malls - Queen's Square, The Landmark Plaza, The World Porters Mall, etc
7. Cup Noodles Museum (for kids)
8. Yokohama Chinatown - for Chinese food. (Motomachi-Chukagai Station)

Japan,Yokohama Minato Mirai 21,Relaxing place in the midst of business district!,"It was a relaxing place walking along the waterfront! Coming from Tokyo, you will find yourself some breather in this place in Yokohama. You could find a place of solace, reading a book or just sit down with a beer enjoying the sea breeze with your loved ones! While I was there, I could see many young families, especially, bring along their children in strollers and dogs there. This place looks like an area for family outings. I went there in the daytime, perhaps you could find couples more in the night time. I believe the night scenery would be even more fantastic and provides a romantic place for couples there.

Japan,Yokohama Minato Mirai 21,A must visit in Yokohama!,"Yokohama is a great example of two sides of a city, conveniently demarcated by the train that passes through. On one side, you have a sprawling concrete jungle filled, and on the other, a pleasant bay side area. Minato-mirai is located on the bay side and does not typically represent one building or one park but is identified by a conglomerate of these. You can have your fill of shopping delights, while with just a walk away is an amusement park for that extra fun. But what really strikes you is how each attraction in the area compliments the other! If you need to take a load off, just head to the pier (Osanbashi or Yamashita) and just sit back and relax.

I found the Yokohama Museum of Art great for its sculptures. For ship lovers the Nippon Maru tall ship built in 1930 and decommissioned in 1984 is worth a tour. The Nippon Maru Memorial Park is actually not a park as one would expect lawns and trees, it's more concrete than nature, joggers use it.
Shoppers can go to the Landmark Tower or the opposite Queen's Square or even to the more affordable World Porters on Shinko island, a 15-minute walk.

The promenade is beautifully landscaped and scattered with statues and momentos of its maritime heritage. It is also excellent for day activities for kids as it has attractions and ferris wheel similar like in Osaka. If weather does not cooperate, you could spend several hours (and thousand dollars) shopping and eating and cinema at Collet Mare Shopping Malls. If you still have energy and credit limit in your card, head to the Aeon mall about 1 km from the station. For the Captain Haddock's fans, you must visit inside the Nipppon Maru.

Japan,Yokohama Minato Mirai 21,Flawless area in Yokohama,"Minatomirai is without a doubt one of the nicest places in Yokohama. The business district is quiet, clean and modern. There's really nothing to complain about. Besides, it offers many possibilities for shopping and dining.

Some notable buildings in Minatomirai are: the Landmark Tower, Queenstower A/B/C, MarkIs, World Porters, the Red Brick Warehouse, the Cup Noodles Museum and of course the iconic Cosmo Clock 21 which used to be the biggest Ferris wheel in the world. At night, every quarter of an hour an animated light show lights up the Ferris wheel for 5 minutes. The 10 remaining minutes are lit up green with a white pointer, imitating a huge green clock. There's also a beautiful harbor which is visited by many couples at night. I recommend going there at night to see the beauty of Minatomirai. Furthermore, a smaller but authentic entertainment district, Noge, is right around the corner near the JR Sakuragicho station. There are countless small bars (izakayas) and restaurants. It's the perfect place for grabbing a few drinks after work with your colleagues. Also worth visiting is the Chinatown near Motomachi station which is around 5 minutes by subway from Minatomirai station.

It's been a pleasure working here; even after 3 months of work I couldn't stop taking pictures of Minatomirai on my way home.",

The closest train stations are on the aptly named Minato Mirai line although you can also walk to closer parts from Yokohama or Sakaragicho stations. Note it is long walk in the station from central Yokohama Station to the Minato Mirai line however, so if you have JR pass already, it is probably just as well to stick with the JR stations.

In this area you can get to such landmarks as the Yokohama Landmark Tower (the tallest building in Japan when it opened) and the large Ferris Wheel in front of the Cosmo Amusement Park. You can also see the Yokohama Bay Bridge from this area. There is lots of shopping including the Red Brick Warehouses. We came here to visit the Cup Noodles Museum.

The tall ship Nippon Maru is anchored here but every single day we were available to take the tour, the box office was closed. Even on sunny days. So it was a disappointment not to be able to tour this majestic tall ship, especially when one has to walk right by it every time one is out!

The moving walkways between the New Otani Inn and the Landmark Hotel (where a good deal of the shopping and restaurants are located) are a real step-saver.

Shops I liked in the area include the Hard Rock Cafe, Starbucks, the grocery store and convenience store. If I were a little more adventurous in the dining category, I would have had a good time exploring the many Asian restaurants on the basement floor. We did enjoy Kissho on the 5th floor of the Landmark for shabu shabu, although it was a bit pricey for the value.

Overall, if you're a shopper, this is the place for you. If you're not, then it's just another pretty Asian mall area.","Written July 12, 2016"

If you are in Tokyo, I would highly recommend you visit Yokohama - either a day trip or spend a couple of days here. It is just 35-45mins by train from Tokyo (Shimbashi to Yokohama).

The view (both day time and night time) of the Yokohama port is simply stunning! Spent a couple of hours just walking along side the port and taking in the beautiful view. Interesting places to visit around this area are - Landmark Tower Sky Garden (great view of Yokohama from the top), Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse, Osanbashi Pier (stunning view!), shopping malls, Hard Rock Cafe Yokohama, Cup Noodles museum and many more! One can easily spend a day here, which is what we did.

With that being said, to get to various locations, you'll need to walk and get used to walking long distances as there is no public transportation that will take you there or to Osanbashi. So, have good shoes/socks before going to this location. And if you haven't walked long distances in awhile, get in the habit of doing so, if you plan to visit this location.

But definitely check out the Cosmo Clock 21 Ferris Wheel, the Landmark tower, Osanbashi, Yokohama Bay Bridge and more!",

It's a nice place to just walk or to jog, if the wind is not too strong.
It's even better if you rent a Bay Bike, it takes you to other interesting Yokohama area faster and cheaper, such as China Town or Yamashita Park. But registration is needed beforehand, that's a little time consuming. It's 150 yen per 30 minutes, you can drop them off at any Bay Bike spots. All the bicycles are with motors, it is really convenient.

The view from the sky scrapers makes you feel like you're in Singapore, not in Japan.

Starbucks with the book store, Tsutaya, is a recommendable place to have a break. Have a cup of coffee and read something you like, as long as you treat the books right they are all free to read at your seat!",

Access by train is easy since Minato Mirai Station is right in Queen's Square (basement level). We took a day trip from Shibuya with a valued Yokohama-MM Pass.
Much of the Minato Mirai 21 area where the Landmark Tower stands are reclaimed land. We skipped the Sky Garden of the Landmark Tower (highest observation deck in Japan, miss the thrilling 360° panoramic view..) but zoomed into ground level instead. There are many Cafes and souvenir shops and we are happy with just window-shopping. The many shopping and entertainment facilities gathered here include the Yokohama Museum of Art, the Mitsubishi Minatomirai Industrial Museum where you can learn about the universe and energy, and Warner Cinemas Minato Mirai multiplex movie theaters. The Cosmo World amusement park has the world's largest Ferris wheel but also functions as a clock. There is also the famous Cup Noodles Museum, shopping at World Porter (our favourite!!), Landmark Plaza, Queen's Square. A little beyond, by foot, will be the Red Brick Warehouse and where one can stroll along the waterfront and the promenade at Yamashit Park.

We loved this place which can be best seen and experience by just walking about.! Cannot help making reference to Kobe HabourLand.
It is also fun and awesome place to spend one’s evening here; evening is the best time to see MM21 and its wonderful lights (esp the beautifully lighted up giant ferries wheel). It sure feels very romantic strolling along the promenade, simply spectacular!
There are many simply too many things to do in Minato Minai and one cannot but just lament that we did not have enough time to take it all in. !! Come appreciate for yourself.",

A contrast to Odaiba, which does the wide open spaces thing well, but connected only by the Yurikamome. I wasn't able to stick around for sunset (weather was changing quickly), but will have to take a night time stroll on a future visit.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,"More than just the ""Cars"" that are the ""Stars""!","Arriving in Nagoya mid-morning by train from Matsumoto, I thought I would abandon my luggage in a locker at Nagoya Station and head to the Toyota Museum before checking-in to my hotel for a 2-night stay. A short hop (1-stop) on a local Meitetsu train to the nearby Sako Station and a few minutes walk down the street brings you to the main entrance. Just entering the attraction, it immediately earned 5-stars for me when I discovered that the normal Y500 entrance fee is waived for Seniors (over 65's) like myself. Audio guides are available if required for Y200, but for me the informative leaflet in English was sufficient to find my way around.
I was blissfully unaware of the Textile Machinery Pavilion and Toyota's history of spinning and weaving prior to visiting and found this part of the exhibit surprisingly interesting. Like most people, I had been drawn to the Museum by the ""Cars"" and the Automotive Pavilion contained a reasonable cross-section of models across the decades since Toyota's first passenger car (Model AA) was produced in 1936.
As well as the cars, I particularly enjoyed the Production Line Reconstructions associated with the Model AA and the exhibit where robotic arms assemble a modern car chassis (.... press the button, stand back and video the balletic performance!).
Before you leave, make sure you take in a performance of a Toyota robot playing the violin in the South Lobby (see leaflet for times). It's not only the ""Cars"" that are the ""Stars""!",

I knew some about this topic, but this section blew me away. The car section does the same for the Toyota car company.

We went to Nagoya just to go to this museum and to the SCMaglev museum, but really underestimated the time it would take to see both, and never made it to the SCMaglev. For someone on the geeky side, like me, this museum is a whole day event. They also have a nice cafeteria, where we had lunch.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Surprised by how good it is,"One of my travelling companions wanted to visit this museum as her first car was a Toyota. As the Toyota museum is part of the sight seeing bus we made it our last stop before heading to the hotel.

We arrived before 3pm but was surprised by how much there was to see and learn. There is the Weaving/Loom Pavilion which tells you about the original founder of Toyota Loom, Sakichi Toyoda. There were really good videos (in English) detailing Sakichi-san's passion and the original of the looming machines that are still in use today. This section was large. It took us more than 1 hour to finish this hall.

We then moved onto Toyota Automobile which tells of Sakichi-san's son, Kiichiro Toyoda's passion and how he started researching and building cars in Japan. We ran out of time, but I estimate we could have stayed for another hour in this area.

Next is the future of inventions. There is a TechnoLand for children. We didn't have time to go in. But through the hall we saw that it was very interesting for primary and junior high school students.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Brilliant experience for all the family,"Aside from the Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium, we had most fun visiting the Toyota Museum. The cost of entry was very reasonable, 500 Yen for adults and 200 Yen for children. And our children who are aged 7 and 8 had a fantastic time here.

The entire place is fully air-conditioned, fully of history, and includes various halls and rooms displaying the different aspects of the history of the Toyoda family and Toyota. There is even an area just for kids.

The first hall we visited was an absolutely huge one full of machinery including those used for spinning and weaving and grading cotton. The machinery is pretty amazing and many of them were running for display and included jacquard weaving machines.

The next massive area was full of car machinery, robotic assembly lines and heavy machinery used to manufacture different car parts including those to weld together the different main parts such as body panels, roof etc. In addition, there was a wonderful display of old Toyota and some modern Lexus cars.

In one area of this hall was an area for kids where they could make a toy car from parts.

Finally, there is a nice gift shop, cafe with decent food, and a robot that plays the violin.

For anyone that has an interest in history or cars or machinery and manufacturing, I would absolutely recommend visiting this museum. It really is interesting and pretty unique.",
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Lots to do and learn,"Paid a minimal entrance fees and the children could learn basic science and road safety in the technology section. This section is educational and children could have hands on experience on activities that educate on wind resistance, among many other concepts.
For adults, it’s interesting to learn that Toyota started off as a garment weaving factory before moving on to manufacture automobiles in the industrial era.
The museum preserves machinery from yester years and there are staff at certain stations to give informative in Japanese. There are English tours available at certain time of the day. The showcase of different Toyotas from different era is highly educational and brings back memories.

Overall this museum is a highlight is Nagoya and highly recommend to visit if in Nagoya.",

We had assumed it would be mainly a car museum with lots of Toyota models. If that's what you are after, you might be disappointed. In fact it was so much better than we had assumed. We had no idea that the Toyota company started with cotton spinning/weaving. Half of this museum is dedicated to the development of technology for that part of the industry, and the other half of the museum is dedicated to the technology development for their automotive industry. Everything is interactive, with so many of the machines operating at the press of a button, or demonstrated by very knowledgeable staff (in English for us). We were given sample wash-cloths from one of the weaving machines and a sample engine part from the forging demonstration. In the automotive section we watched full-sized automotive manufacturing robots demonstrating how they put a vehicle together, weld and paint it, and a full-size model of the inner workings of a car demonstrated how a car works, complete with English commentary and lights indicated each component as it was spoken about. The whole museum was just incredibly well set up and very informative.
As a bonus all our kids got to construct a miniature pull-back model of the Model A Toyota for no extra cost, as well as a stamped key ring and molded plastic key ring, which were designed to demonstrate industrial processes.
There is a kids play area that you book into a time slot for (no additional cost) and a cafe.","Written January 11, 2019"

You can actually see the looms run, cotton convert into thread, history of toyota, see how forgings are made, see how robots work to weld a car, paint a car... an overview of the assembly process in olden days. Though our trip was for only 1.5 hrs, i felt minimum 4 hrs r required for covering the entire museum. If u want a guide u can be one of the 1st 20 customers. It opens at 9:30am. But even without a guide you can understand most of it. English or japanese you'll not hv a problem. The demonstrators r very courteous which is typical of the Japanese culture. There's also a museum shop where you can buy some artefacts related to Toyota like scaled versions of actual cars. One'll also get to know the entire history of Toyota. Fascinating and rivetting.

It is interesting to see the evolution of textile and automobile production from manual equipments to high-tech automatic robotic technology. Scientific principles and historical facts are very clearly explained and there are ample English signs around the museum. There are many interactive exhibits, such as the 600-ton metal press which can be controlled by visitors. (Very fun and fascinating.) Don't miss the robot violinist, who plays 2 musical pieces every 2 hours. In my opinion, the robot violinist is impressive and plays like a real violinist, but the violin sounds squeaky due to insufficient rosin on the bow.","Written May 20, 2018"

As for the automotive area, it is more enjoyable (in my opinion) as there are many automated demonstrations including the assembling sessions. It is more relax as we can see the demo repeatedly by pressing a button.
There are also some guides to explain the vehicles' specialties.

The souvenir shop is also worth to stop by to buy some limited edition goods.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Comprehensive overview of Toyoda family and their business dynasty,"This museum provides a comprehensive overview of the Toyoda family and the Toyota conglomerate. We found the textiles section a bit boring, but the automotive section was fascinating.

The first half of the museum was about the textiles background of the Toyota company was well as the history of the founder of the company. There was a big showroom on looms, but we weren't too interested in that.

The second half of the museum was dedicated to the Toyota automotive company and that was much more up our alley. We saw a robot play a couple of songs on the violin, which was astounding in its level of detail and perfection (we saw the 2:40pm performance - check the guide as there are only a couple a day). We saw footage other other robots performing, although those robots were retired and just on display. We went on the 3:15pm free English speaking tour and we were lucky enough to have a private tour as we were the only attendees. Our guide took us on a 45 minute tour of the automotive section. We liked that there were staff posted at each main exhibit and our guide would ask them to demonstrate their exhibit for us. Some staff opened the doors of vintage cars to show us their interiors. Others did live demos of on shaping machines. We wouldn't have known to ask them for a demonstration if the guide hadn't been with us. We were shown how automated car production is these days with the use of robots. The robots that put together the cars were awesome. There was also a large exhibition hall containing different types of Toyota cars from vintage cars to the latest models. We were particularly impressed with the electric and hydrogen powered vehicles and are keen to own one ourselves one day.

There was also techno land, an interactive section of the museum mainly for kids (and big kids) where you could go on rides like a car ride where the object of the ride is to leave a safe space between you and the cartoon vehicle in front and a wind tunnel where you can experience what it's like to be in winds of 15 miles a second. We spent 30min in that section.",
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Very informative!,"If you are interested in cars and engines, this attraction is for you!

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Toyota as textile Company,,"Written March 22, 2018"
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Best place to visit in Nagoya,"To be honest, Nagoya is more of a transportation hub than a tourist spot. The Nagoya castle is only so so, and the famous Nagoya wings are not that special either.

Toyota Commemorative Museum in Nagoya is surprisingly a great place to visit and definitely the top attraction in Nagoya. To set the expectation right, this is not like Geneva car show or one of those full blown automotive museum in Europe. But it does have its unique charm and definitely worth a visit if you are in Nagoya area.

Location:
======
It's about 10 to 15 minutes by bus or taxi to the museum from Nagoya station. I'd recommend a taxi for a party of 4 since the fare would be about the same as that of taking a bus.

Admission:
=======
Ticket admission is relatively cheap and seniors can enter for free. Note that senior discount in Japan is usually limited to local residents of that particular region, not to mention foreigners. So, it is unusual for foreign seniors to have this type of discount.

Museum:
=======
Museum is separated into two section, the textile and the automotive section. (Toyota started off as a textile company). Even if you are not into textile , the display of many full scale textile machines are very impressive. Even if you want to skip this section, try to stop by one or two of the demo stations to watch the huge machines in action.

The automotive section mostly focused on how Toyota started and how it turned in to the automotive giant. Most exhibits are in Japanese with some English. I'd highly recommend the free English guided tour. (See below).

Even if you don't like cars, you can easily spend 1 - 2 hours in the automotive section. There are demos of many full size manufacturing machines to explain different phase in the automobile production. There are some very modern manufacturing robots too. Since the focus is more on the toyota automotive technology as well as its manufacturing, don't expect a full display of all Toyota models even though the display floor is huge. Unlike car shows, for most of the cars displayed, visitors are not allowed to sit inside.

Children friendliness:
================
Throughout the museum, there are numerous children friendly display for kids to interact with. However, live demos are explained only in Japanese. But overall, kids can still have a good time fiddling with the different exhibits.
Don't miss out do it yourself model car assembling station for kids. They give you a kit for model cars for the children to assemble. It's a lot of fun.

There is also a violin recital played by a Toyota robot. Unfortunately, that performance was a bit disappointing , maybe I was expecting too much. It was nevertheless an engineering marvel.

English guided tour:
===============
You'll need to check the time of the English guided tour as well as sign up for it when you enter the museum. They will give you a receipt for the guided tour. Some reviewers complained that the tour guide's English was hard to understand, but that's not my case. The guide we had was excellent and we had no problem understanding her English. I highly recommend joining the guided tour , it helped me understand many of the main exhibits in a quick concise way. Tour lasted about 30-45 minutes.

Recommendations:
==============
- Remember that seniors get free admission
- Take a taxi from Nagoya Station if you are a party of 4
- Sign up for English guided tour at the entrance (where they collect your ticket)
- Model Car kit for children.
- There is a cafe but I'd have a meal before coming here.
- I would allocate at least 2-3 hours for the museum, (or more if you are a car enthusiast)","Written March 12, 2018"

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,A Gem in the Heart of Nagoya,"I can't say enough great things about the exhibits and live demonstrations in this museum. Easy to get to by a quick bus ride, you can spend the better part of a day here. There are two main sections (textiles and cars) and both are equally as interesting. (We spent too much time on the textile side and almost forgot about the car side!) The live demonstrations of the machinery on both sections of the museum bring to life processes of history.

As an engineer, I completely appreciated how things were presented with plenty of information for someone with a technical background. However even for children and people unfamiliar with the technology, there are many fun things to see and enjoy.

Even if stopping in Nagoya for a short stay - this is one definite stop to consider.","Written March 5, 2018"

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Impressive interactive exhibits,"I decided to go here based on a review that raved about a part of the museum that we didn't even get to visit! Still enjoyed it! The first section of the museum is about textiles that were made by the Toyoda company before they got into the car business. The sheer quantity of machinery they have here is astounding. I'd recommend trying to spend under an hour in the first part so you don't get so burned out that you don't appreciate the rest. Honestly, you could spend a full 8 hour day in this museum. The second part of the museum is automobiles, of course. There are a ton of interactive exhibits that explain how a car works. Throughout the museum (both textile + cars) there are staff members giving demonstrations and explanations in both Japanese and English -- maybe not everyday, but we went on a weekend. The final segment of the museum is an area probably designed for kids but anyone can enter. However, this is a ticketed attraction that has reservations for entrance times. We didn't realize that until very late in the day, and couldn't get into that section for another 2 hours because it was all full. Ask about how to reserve a time for it when you get your tickets.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Unexpected fun,I went thinking would just be a mock factory you walk through. I was very wrong. They had a huge area on textiles with ancient looms and advancing up to current methods of making cloth. The car area walked you through the history of every part of the car.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,An Interactive Automotive Museum With Many Surprises,"I consider the Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology in Nagoya a must-see for not just gear-heads (like myself and my brother who visited with me) but also for families with children who will be interested by the myriad interactive displays. But the tour starts where inventor and industrialist Toyoda started; with textile loom technology and development. In the entry lobby to the textile museum stands the massive circular loom invented by Toyoda at the beginning of the 20th century. This intriguing 1906 machine is still operable and is demonstrated by a docent on a regular schedule.

Many of the machines and processes of both textile and automotive technology are actuated by your press of a button or operated and explained in both Japanese and English by one of the many museum docents. In the auto section the kid in me enjoyed simultaneously pressing two large buttons (just as a press operator must do) to actuate the 600-ton sheet-metal press on display.

The signage is in Japanese and English and the docents, who are assigned to particular displays, have enough English to explain their display. There is a cafe in the museum where we had an inexpensive light lunch. The museum's admission charge is a very reasonable 500 Yen for adults (currently about $4.50US). Children are at a reduced rate but my brother and I as Seniors (65+) received free admission.","Written October 10, 2017"

It is really the story of the 20th century, told through the lens of a Japanese entrepreneur, and also gives a glimpse he future of cars. It was well worth the visit for those interested in cars, science, engineering and technology, and also for those who are really not so interested in those topics, who also will learn something. The site is well laid out and easy to follow. They have a restaurant (did not try) outside the admission area, and a nice cafe which I did eat at.

Throughout both sections were clear, live demonstrations of spinning cotton, from spinning wheels to modern equipment. I was amazed at how many working pieces of equipment were there. Numerous times, the staff would start a demo when I approached their area. The auto section has many displays with moving parts showing how auto systems work (e.g. steering, brakes, transmission, etc.), and the manufacturing process. I don't have young kids, but there was an interactive section for kids that looked very engaging.

I would highly recommend this museum.",

We went to see the car museum in mind, but were fascinated by the Toyota looms and spinning machines that were the foundation of the company. It was a lovely learning experience to see how machines take raw cotton and turn it into yarn, thread, and then fabric. Many of the machines are operational and show you the entire process.

The car museum is cool too. In expected Japanese fashion, the museum get into the small details of the inside of a car and how it is made.

There're a lot of exhibitions and demonstration. We didn't join the guided English tours, but it's not difficult to understand. It's actually like a science museum, but focusing on weaving and car related (Toyota was started up as a weaving factory).
Besides exhibition, there is a game center which games are also related to car science. For sure kids will have fun there, don't miss it if you've kids. Even I and my wife enjoyed the games there.

Looms are weaving machines. We were so happy to see this because we had no idea we would find such huge display of looms, the history and the time line of the Toyoda Looms Works who later became Toyota Motor Corporation. You can observe the many different types of looms from the antique and very simple models to the very huge more modern types. The entrance fee is very affordable and it is a very popular place to visit. I recommend going early. After seeing the looms area which by the way is very big, we moved on to the car display warehouse or show room. Again we were amazed to learn the history of how Toyoda became Toyota and the whole line of cars that were produced in the early years. This is an amazing place to visit and it will not let you down.

It allows an interesting view of Toyota and the tour can be as quick or long as you want; three hours will cover most of the facility and they have a few activities for small kids. The context can be a bit technical but they managed to offer exhibitions that are also fun to watch, with robots and parts of the production line that go in motion at the touch of a button. Easy to access; although subway stations aren't as close and a 15 min walk is necessary. The museum is open until later most days; and taxis are available. A small souvenir store offers toys; small models of the Toyota cars and some clothing; sizes are limited to small - medium.

Most of it is self explanatory but we also had a guide with good English to help us although it was hard to hear clearly. It was fascinating to see cars being assembled with a mixture of people and robots. In the museum we saw some of the latest models and future innovations as well as some parts of the company's past history. A very glossy high tech display that was well worth the visit.,"Written May 14, 2017"
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Superb museum,Great displays about the history and the manufacturing process of Toyota...a little too much is dedicated to the looms but the automotive section would impress even those not interested in cars...good few hours spent here!,

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,"NIcely spent few hours, but dedicated mostly to looms, not cars","NIcely spent few hours. But if you are a car enthusiast and expect tons and tons of Toyota cars, please be aware that cars and car industry is roughly just a one third of the whole museum. The rest is dedicated to circular looms and this kind of machines, which made Toyota successfull and recognised worldwide.

Despite the ""Direction & Public Transportation"" information at the official pages, I do recommend you to go to ""Sako"" station instead. If you come from Nagoya station direction, the exit and museum direction will be towards your direction. Just go downstairs in the train station and walk towards east. Cross the street to your right side and continue walking east. You will arrive in 5-10 minutes, tops.

In April, the entrance fee was 500JPY for an adult, students have 200/300JPY discount. You can also buy annual ticket and several others, but most of you will stick with the 500JPY basic. The tickets can be purchased at the vending machine, which is also in English (I remember seeing there also Korean language, one kind of Chinese and maybe also others, but do not catch me there). The ticket machine is really easy, nothing complicated like Japanese subway ticket machines.
You get English leaflet and the staff also speaks somehow English, so they are able to explain basic stuff to you as well,

The museum has also restaurant, few vending machines with soft drinks and several toilets. Cannot comment on the restaurant, as I have not used it's service.

If you are looking for an easy spent 2-3 hours, this is the place to be.",

Everyone would great us and try to speak english ( no matter their level they tried). We felt so welcome. The staff always warned us before they showed us loud machinery in case our baby would be scared.
This is perfect for car fans, engineering geeks, and we'll everyone. The first half is all about the cloth industry( Toyato started with making fabrics). Then the second half is about cars. On weekends and holidays there are special crafts for kids!","Written May 6, 2017"

Well thought out and so much to hold your interest I'd like me you are a technical buff. The crime de resistance was pressing the button and watching the car being put together, all this for only JPYen500, £3.50, you simply cannot go wrong. You will need 2-3hrs to fully appreciate the place. Also make sure you watch the robot play the violin 👍, this happens hourly at .40.",

The entrance of the museum was a huge weaving machine, developed and engineered by the Mr.Toyoda's previous business, textile manufacturing. The first section was dedicated to this. As walking along the suggested route. I saw many demonstrations from making cotton seeds into threads then to fabric. This part was well organized and well explained by the staffs as well as the displays The car manufacturing part was less impressive to me, perhaps due to my limited knowledge and interest in mechanics.

The exhibits for the textile and automotive production are very detailed, the descriptions and models are great, and the museum is expansive enough (physically and information-wise) that you could spend an entire day if you wanted to.

The only negative is the small collection of antique Toyotas. Only a couple are displayed, which doesn't do Toyota's history (e.g. Celica lineage, the FJs, Supras, MR2s, and unique one-offs such as the Toyota Classic)","Written April 9, 2017"

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Really enjoyable museum to visit,"This museum looks deceptively small from the outside, but there is an amazing amount packed into this museum dedicated to the industrial and technological achievements of the Toyota name.

It seems every effort has been made to make your visit to the museum a memorable one, and it is wonderful - English tours are available, staff stationed at special sections of the museum to demonstrate the workings of devices and buttons for you to press as you walk along and see the huge contributions the Toyota company, especially father and son, Sakichi Toyoda and Kiichiro Toyoda respectively has done not only for Japan but for the world.

This museum was a truly wonderful and educational way to spend an afternoon in Nagoya- I found the staff to be very nice in the museum- they would try their best to explain demonstrations in English, or approach us and help demonstrate particularly inventions that require explanation to fully understand its concept and purpose.

There is a cafe and a souvenir shop after the museum ends, but also a few of Toyota's robots on display, one of which will demonstrate its ability to play the violin every so often (performance times are listed) just outside the souvenir shop. For children (and big children like me), there is a centre called 'technoland' where intelligence games can be enjoyed.","Written March 24, 2017"

The automotive manufacturing section is also outstanding.

The museum Guide Book is probably the best written, most informative museum guide book ever written -- 324 pages!

My suggestion is to spend a few hours in the museum, buy the guide book, read it and then return a day or so later to further learn about what was most interesting.

If you like industrial history, I suggest a solo visit -- because you are unlikely to be able to visit with someone who wants to spend time at the same exhibits you will enjoy.","Written February 10, 2017"

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Authentic if you are into Museums!,"Went here on a Sunday afternoon and was very impressed with what was available to see. I am by nature a museum geek and this one was high up on the list for most interesting.

In short, the museum is broke up into 4 main parts:
1) Loomworks
2) Automotive
3) Metal works
4) Technology

I spent a small time in loomworks and a majority in automotive (I work in automotive). In both portions of museum, what amazed me most was the amount of hands on, active exhibitions they had. For the loomworks, there must have been 50 or more loom machines that various workers were operating when people came up.

For the automotive, they had the same type of on hands exhibitions. Specifically, they took you through the different mfg processes of building a car. Forging, Casting, Machining, Pressing, Welding, Painting, Assembly. All of it was super hands on and authentic to real processes.

Cost was so cheap (500 yen + 200 yen optional rental for audio set). The Toyota companies sponsor the museum which makes it so cheap the public.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Disneyland for engineers,"I am an engineer and have probably never seen a better museum. It's a combination of that TV show ""how things work"" and an automotive fantasy camp. Sure you get high quality videos of the whole line in many different languages. But only here do you get to see the entire production of cars from raw steel to die casting engine blocks, forging and stamping steel, panel assembly, painting, and final assembly -in person. Even better, you get to run the actual equipment from the 80s (push the button and 30' tall gigantic machinery runs). To top off the experience they have a metal working demonstration where they actually perform the forging etc in small scale and kids can take home a sample. There's ask a kids techno zone where they can drive a car, experience a wind tunnel, and more. Almost everything is in English. For the serious engineer who loves the Smithsonian museums I'd recommend this as a day trip from Tokyo. There's also a hands in area I wish I could have seen - they have sample engines and impact wrenches!",
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,"As a mechanical engineering student, this was heaven.","I had an amazing 4 hours going through this museum. 4 hours wasn't even enough to take a look at everything individually. I wish I had a bit more time to go through everything. The explanations are written well in both Japanese and English. But most of the demonstrations are done in Japanese unless you take the English tour in the afternoon. Nonetheless, I love this place and I would love to go again.","Written August 18, 2016"
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,An Underestimated Visit,"Actually, we'd never stopped by in Nagoya if one of my friends didn't stay there. We were on our way back to Tokyo so there we were, in Nagoya.

My friend didn't even know that this museum is existed, so that was the first time for him as well after been staying in Japan for 6 months.

It was only one station away from Nagoya station, and we didn't have to walk far to reach it.

When we entered, we were exposed to textile museum, different type of cotton, the different of cotton vs others, etc. Frankly speaking, I was not excited to see it. But hey, we're far away from home and put an effort to stop in Nagoya, a-not-so-popular city for Indonesians.

But then it started to change when we were about to reach the next exhibition, then.. We can see the integrated showcases, different type of machines, how the showcase technically explaining the mechanism of a car, and not to mention.. The showcase of retro cars, first generation of the brand lines i.e. 1970 Celica GT, first generation of Camry.. Wow!!

On the background, we could see the showcase on how a car was produced. Our daughter was pretty much excited as well for the kids activities, she can build a toy car from a scratch and got a helpful hand from a granpa (haha) for construct that toy car. At the end, she can bring that toy car for her. She was also allowed to make a keycahin and choose the color. Very interactive.

My husband, spent the most of his time looking at the machines one by one 😄😄 we delayed our departure to Tokyo almost for 4hrs.

By the end of the tour, you can listened to Toyota robot playing a biola by itself. Incredible. You will not regret to visit this museum.","Written August 11, 2016"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Great excursion to the summit of Mt. Moiwa!,"Great excursion involving various forms of transportation to get to the summit of Mt. Moiwa (531m). First you need to take the subway to Susukino subway station (Station N08 on the Namboku Subway Line), then interchange with the Sapporo Streetcar (tram) at street level (Streetcar stop SC23). Take the tram to Ropeway Iriguchi (Streetcar stop SC10); 11-stops anticlockwise or 13-stops in a clockwise direction. Close by the Ropeway tram stop, there is a bus stop with turning circle for the Ropeway shuttle bus; a green 4WD, hi-wheelbase minibus, which takes 5-mins to negotiate the climb up the hill to the Moiwa Base Station.
The 1st leg from Base Station to Mid Station is by Ropeway; the gondola can accommodate up to 66 passengers for the 5-min journey and gondolas depart every 15-mins. At Mid Station you transfer to the Mo-risu Cars which transport you to the Summit Station in 2-mins. The Mo-risu consist of a pair of mini cable cars in tandem; each can hold 30 passengers (60 in total) and also depart every 15-mins.
When I travelled on a January Monday morning, traffic was surprisingly light and blessed with good visibility the views of snow-covered Sapporo from the summit were spectacular. Great excursion, enjoyed the transportation and a special shout-out to Mt. Moiwa Ropeway for giving a discount to Senior Citizens like myself!",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Weather and views were fabulous,"Visited with family

Pros
1) There was a free shuttle from the tram station. As usual, the shuttle driver was helpful especially we had a baby in tow.
2) Went there right after breakfast, which was just right for a family with baby. But it would have been more perfect night time with the city lights view.
3) Weather was nice. Coming from a tropical country, the almost winter weather was nice and cooling.
4) They had several snack shops and a restaurant, so food is not really a problem.
5) Some of my family members opted to hike going up Mt. Moiwa but most of us took the cable car which had amazing views. Mt Moiwa is perfect for hikers!
6) The place was picturesque.
7) There is also a souvenir shop, toilet is not a problem.

To get to Mount Moiwa from the city , take the tram and then the shuttle bus to the base of the ropeway, which goes about two-thirds of the way to the summit.

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,"Mount Moiwa, Wonderful During Winter","I visited Mount Moiwa on 5 February 2020. It was my first time being there on my winter budget trip in Hokkaido, Japan.

Transportation
It is really convenient to reach many places in Hokkaido if you stay near big stations like Sapporo or Odori. I stayed near Sapporo station (I will write about the accommodation in a separate review). I took a walk from the station to Odori station and then Susukino station via underpass including a shopping tunnel called Pole Town to avoid the cold air. The distance between Sapporo and Susukino station is 1.6 km. The duration will depend on the walking speed.

After reaching Susukino station, I took exit with the sign ""Street Car"" then took the tram to reach the closest station to Mount Moiwa, Iriguchi rope way station. It took about 20 minutes to get the rope way station and I paid JPY200 per adult. Child fare was JPY100 per child.

The Street Car line is actually a closed-double-loops (inner and outer), before taking the tram, please make sure that the loop line will stop at Iriguchi rope way station.

From Iriguchi rope way station there are two alternatives to reach Mount Moiwa lower terminal: by walking for about 10 to 15 minutes or by taking the free shuttle bus. I took the free shuttle bus which departed every 15 minutes from 10:45 a.m. since the opening hours of Mount Moiwa is 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. during winter.

At the lower terminal I bought a two-way-ticket for rope way and cable car to reach the highest point of Mount Moiwa. The fare was JPY1,700 per adult for a return trip. Child fare was JPY850 per child. The transfer between rope way and cable car in the middle terminal was very convenient. The duration of both rope way and cable car was about 30 minutes one way including the transfer.

Activities
During winter, the highest point of Mount Moiwa becomes a snow playground which provides scenic views of surrounding mountains and the Sapporo city. When I got there I saw many families with young children playing snow and some people visited and prayed at the small shrine there. There were two favorite spots at Mount Moiwa which attracted many visitors to take pictures at: ""The Fortune Bell"" and ""Love Padlock"". There were also some shops and cafe at the terminal to keep visitors warm from the cold air outside.

Time To Visit
To enjoy the snow playground especially with young children, it is better to visit there at morning or afternoon. To enjoy the Sapporo city view, it is better to visit there at sunset or evening.",

Tip: There are express bus covered by JR pass to and from Sapporo station.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Nice view,Read about this place and decided to try it since it was not too far from our hotel. Took street car then free shuttle bus to the ropeway station. Paid ¥1700 per person for return trip for ropeway and mini cable car. The weather was cold and windy. But the view was fantastic. The cable car was very steady. Feel safe when riding it. From the top we can see the city view. Nice experience and we reached there around 5pm and already dark. Lucky me!,

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Breathtaking,"Japan is surrounded by mountains and we chose to visit Mount Moiwa. It is easy to get to by tram. From the tram station it is a bit of a walk uphill to the entrance. We went in the late afternoon in hope to catch the day and night scene from the top. We were not disappointed. The cable car ride up offers a magnificent view of the mountain side and the city of Hokkaido. You can get off at the first station and walk the remaining distance to the top but we decided to go all the way up. The view of Sapporo at the top was breathtaking. The mountain is only 539mtrs high but the view and experience at the top was absolutely breathtaking for me. On the way up I saw a cemetery at the side of the mountain, a peaceful and beautiful final resting place for sure.","Written December 30, 2019"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Didn't have a good view when I was there (2nd week Dec 2019),"They have a live cam installed at the top of the hill where you can preview the scenery on a TV screen at reception floor, before you purchase the tickets.

It was night time on our first visit there. We were hoping to see the magnificent view but unfortunately, there was heavy snow fall. The receptionist pointed at the TV screen and told us there is no view at that time (from the TV screen it was pitch black).

He was polite enough to apologize to us, although it was the weather and no one could have done anything about it.

We left and visited again a few days later. This time in the afternoon. The weather was fairly good, but still not clear enough. Went up all the same but didn't have a good view of the city.

There isn't much to do there at the top, really. If you're going just for the view, I suppose 30 minutes would be more than enough.

Make sure the sky is 110% clear on your visit, or you'll be disappointed.",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Check the weather before heading to Mt Moiwa!,"The views are astounding, yes... but provided you can see them.

We were in Sapporo for a period of 5 days, but unfortunately when I checked their weather app, it seemed that there was dense fog almost everyday while we were there. Nevertheless we made a trip up - we did see the day view and catch a bit of the sunset, but while we were waiting for the night view, dense fog suddenly hit us. I see the warning alert on the weather app about this dense fog and it looked like it's going to stay, so we cut short our stay at Mt Moiwa and made our way down.

There are quite a lot of visitors who didn't know about the fog (they can't see the fog from below) until they went to the ropeway ticket counter and almost bought the tickets, and that's when they saw the ""real time TV"" that nothing can be seen even if they head up the mountain.

By the way, you can get nice sunset views and photos on the other side of the observation deck (where there wasn't that many tourists). And yes, it is extremely cold. Come prepared with your windproof shell and windproof gloves.",

Anyways, the staff told us we can ride midway for a lower price. Since riding all the way to the top will cost more and also no view because of the fog.

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Day visit to the mountain near Sapporo,"Drove up to the mountain - mid point, before walking up the remaining 200 m. It is 660 Yen for the toll.
It was extremely difficult to find the entrance, maybe I was searching for the wrong place. Only found the toll highway leading up to the mid-point on my third attempt, leaving little time to enjoy the view.

Decided to walk up the remaining distance as it was supposed to be 200 m. It was exhausting for my family, as we are not the outdoor type. But the locals were moving up the same path relatively fast and with ease.

Walked down from the summit using the 500 m (less physical demanding) as we were quite tired and it was dangerous to use the shorter route.

There were signs to discourage using of the paths at night, in view of safety.
It was not too crowded during the visit at just before noon.
Would consider the night visit in the next visit.","Written June 25, 2019"

The cafe was closed when we were there at around 9 pm. Coming down took longer as there was a queue of people waiting for the cable cars.
The view of worth the effort to go. The guide inside the cable cars only spoke in Japanese so we didn’t know what she was saying.
I reckon we took around 2 hrs in all going up and coming down, even if we didn’t linger longer than 20 mins at the top due to all the waiting time taken.",

I was there during the Golden Week holidays in Japan and it was loaded with tourists. Loaded like the lines to go in at 7 PM for the night view were running at least an hour waiting.

I left Sapporo -Odori area by the mini-tram around 430 PM. Get off at Ropeway Iriguchi station. You can pay in the tram with your IC/Passmo card. There is a shuttle bus to take you to the rope way station. If you can walk, it's a 15 min quick walk. Skip the bus. You have to wait some.

There will be two cable cars to take you up to the top. One takes you to the base, the next one takes you to the top.

I got there at 530 pm, saw the sun set which was by about 630-645 pm and I started to head back at 7 pm. By this time the rush was MANIC to see the night view.
The sunset is amazing on the other side of the same viewing platform with no people to push you around or cameras in your face.

At 7 pm, on the way down in a not so crowded cable car you will see a pretty fantastic view of Sapporo un-hindered by the crowds. And to me this is worth it than standing in lines to first go up and then stand in unending lines to then come down...do the smart thing ;)

Getting the tram from Sapporo, there's a complementary shuttle service to the rope-way a 50m walk from the stop which I would highly recommend taking advantage of in winter. In summer I assume the walk to the ropeway (10-15mins) would be a nice stroll, however in winter the ice can cause some problems while hiking up to the entrance.

After purchasing our tickets, we entered the gondola and proceeded up the mountain. I was on the look out for any wild animals in the snow below (I didn't see any), but still took the time to appreciate the spectacular views as we went up the mountain.

When we reached the top it was quite clear we were amongst the first to reach the summit as the snow was untouched. We quickly went about changing that, throwing snowballs and making snow angels in the powder. From there we wandered around, went to the 'lovers tower' (though none of us were coupled up) and walked around the small shrine-like structure. You can also do walks from the top, however our group was not equipped for it.

It was quite cloudy when we went up, so we didn't get the views from the top. When you purchase your tickets below there is a current visibility rating so we knew this would be the case. It was still worth the time to go up to the top, and the views available on the gondola ride were a great consolation.

The restaurant/kiosk opens around 1pm, however if you want a warm drink there is a vending machine inside. You can also pack your own food and eat in the rest area below the restaurant which offers floor to ceiling views out into the snow.

Before leaving I bought a few cute souvenirs from the gift shop, then it was back out into the city. We spent roughly two hours up the top taking photos and horsing around.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Beautiful view of Saporro!!,I went there on a winter and and everything was so white and pristine... Beautiful place! You go up and down Mt Moiwa in a cable car.

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Best view of Sapporo,Great view of Sapporo. We gladly paid to use the ropeway and the rail car to go to the top of the mountain. The star projection in the little movie theater at the top of the mountain is not really interesting for people who don't understand Japanese.,
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,The Bell of Happiness!,"With a big family in tow, it was quite a struggle to go up to Mt. Moiwa. There were several transfers before reaching the place but it was worth it! It might not be as high up as the mountains we went up to in Switzerland with cable cars, but Mt. Moiwa has its own charm. Before going up, there was a monitor where you can see the conditions at the top, for you to decide if you wanted to go with not so clear views because of winter weather. It was cloudy when we reached there but hey, we didn’t travel all the way there just to be deterred by a few clouds. And so up we went, and reached the top, and rang the bell of happiness!",

We rode the tramp for the first time, The driver was so polite and kind to us. After the tramp we took the free shuttle bus to the cable station. There are 2 rides to the top.
The view was breathtaking, not only on top but also on the way.
On our way down they have a wide open for children to enjoy snow. If you have children take the time to go there.",

We left OSJ around 4.30pm, timing it such that we would get to Mt.Moiwa when it was dark. We read that the night views, because of the city lights were beautiful.
The ride on the ropeway and cable car was orderly and packed but offered lovely views of the city. It was extremely cold in the open areas and there is a Cafe at midpoint whe you could enjoy hot drinks, snacks and the view.

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Things to do at night,"Free shuttle bus from the streetbus (tram) station Ropeway Iriguchi. Also a good opportunity to try other local restaurants in the neighborhood away from the usual tourist areas like Sapporo train station, Odori or Susukino.

Mount Moiwa is a very popular tourist spot, even among the Japanese domestic tourists. Nonetheless, all the queues are only 10~15 minutes and always in order.

There is a restaurant on the mountain called Jewel but it closes at around 9pm, last order is 8 or 830pm. Price for two legs round trip to the middle and top of the mountain, total ride less than 8min, costs about Jpy 1700.

I wouldn't say the Sapporo nightview is absolutely breathtaking but it is still a nice thing to do at night.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Visit Mt Moiwa for a gorgeous night view of Sapporo,"We visited Mt Moiwa on our first night in Sapporo. We decided to go there at night so we could view the bright city lights. We visited on an autumn night and it was pretty chilly so if you're doing the same thing,be sure to dress warmly. We took as many photos as we can, rang the bell (which was all lit up at night) then went back down to buy some stuff at the souvenir shop.

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Sapporo Under Your Nose,"Mt. Moiwa boasts the best spot to view the city of Sapporo, and it did draw lots of people even on a rainy, humid August night. As you might have already learned, you need to take two different gondolas to get to the top. As the gondola sent us upward, the nightly cityscape slowly and elegantly came into view, despite the annoyingly unstoppable rain. Reaching the top, well, the expected sense of excitement did not kick in. I guess it's again because of the rain. We didn't stay long as there was no shelter or awning where we could temporarily shun the raindrops. Maybe we should have come during the day time? Some afterthought after all this? The small windfall of riding on the city tram, which was very different from riding the metro. (To get to Mt. Moiwa, you either have to hop on a tram (streetcar), or hire a taxi.)",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Peak is for lovers,"Mt Moiwa can be reached by a cable car. It is one of highest mountains in the Sapporo area.The peak has a bell, which lovers can ring to ensure eternal love, and also attach a padlock to the railing. The view from Mt Moiwa is gratifying. The peak is over 500 metres (1640 feet) above sea level. You can dine at Jewels Restaurant at the peak, make a reservation, it is often booked out. Tram is probably the best way to get to the base of the mountain.is b y tram (streetcar).","Written October 3, 2018"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Honestly.....,"Don't really know what the fuss is about...to get there u need to get into a street tram, then get on a shuttle bus, then pay to get on a ropeway (which is basically a cable car) to the middle level, then a transfer to a smaller cable car to get to the summit.

You do get a nice view of Sapporo and if you can aim to be there around sunset to catch the sunset and the night lights of Sapporo.

It does get pretty cold up there so bring a sweater

the whole experience will cost around 2100 yen each...including the tram ride...so it's not cheap..","Written September 30, 2018"

These are one of the best shots I got.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,How to Get There (Using Tram),"Easy way to get there is to take the tram (streetcar). There’s only one tram line and it makes a loop through the city. The Ropeway Iriguchi tram stop where you want to get off is about half way around the loop if you get on where most tourists do: on the street above the Susukino subway stop. So you can’t get on the wrong tram or go the wrong way. Riding the tram is a fun & cheap way to get a tour of the City’s various neighborhoods. The trams run on parallel tracks in opposite directions: some go clockwise around the loop and others go counter-clockwise. At Susukino, there are two separate tram stations, one for each direction, around the corner from each other. The tram stations have a video display that shows the whole loop and where each tram is on the loop in real time, so you can see where the oncoming tram is. If it’s too far away, you can cross the street to get the tram going the other direction. Check how many people are getting on – locals use the tram for commuting so, for example, in the afternoon the trams going counter-clockwise are much more crowded than the ones going clockwise from the Susukino station. Like buses, you get on in the middle of the tram and exit out the front door, paying at the farebox as you leave. Fare is a flat ¥200 for adults no matter how far you go. It’s best if you have an IC commuter card so you can pay by touch instead of fumbling for coins. At the Ropeway Iriguchi station, the free shuttle bus is diagonally across the intersection. You can’t miss it because there’s an obvious bus turnout there and anyway half the passengers on the tram will be walking there. Most people ride the bus even though the Ropeway is only a few blocks away, because it is steeply uphill. Getting on the cable car, go to the back of the car since as the car travels up the mountain the views of the city are in the back. Up front, all you see are trees. Once at the top, my tip is to buy the roasted potato cheese stick. Looks like a roasted popsicle made of mashed potato. It’s one of those simple hot snacks that are unbelievably good. So good I had to buy a second one.","Written September 1, 2018"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Great views and good hiking,"We hiked up this mountain, using directions provided from an internet search. The hike up took us slightly more than an hour on a well-marked and we'll-travelled trail, past many Buddhist statues and local residents also hiking. The trail was slightly muddy due to recent rain. At the top there is a building with viewing platform and lounges as well as a snack bar and gift shop. A Buddhist shrine is also at the top. Since rain started while we were there, we took the incline/cable car down. All of Sapporo can be seen from the top. Although we were there during daylight, it is supposed to be one of the best views in Japan at night.","Written August 22, 2018"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Great Morning Hike,"So you can take the cable car if you want to, but I went with a group of people hiking up the trail. The trail is super well maintained and should be doable for all ages as long as you're physically fit enough to hike uphill. The top is a very beautiful view. I went in the morning, but the night view is famous. If hiking isn't your thing, there is a cable car that goes straight up to the top.

Try to time it where you're not there at the same time as a tour group/bus, though.",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Great View of Sapporo,"I brought my two sons and my daughter-in-law to Sapporo for a few days in July and we planned on going to Mt. Moiwa on July 14th. However, the rainy weather forced us to cancel those plans because the cloud cover was very bad on that day and the weather forced us to go underground for that day.

The weather was great on July 18th and we made to Mt. Moiwa at 10:30 in the morning. We were in the first car up the hill, and the view was real nice. You don't realize how big Sapproro is until you see it fro the top of Mt. Moiwa. The city just unfolds below you and you can see it just spread out before you. Just a great view.

The ropeway and cogged cable car ride are really cool. On the way down on the ropeway, I was able to sit in the front and got some really cool videos of the descent to the main station. A really good trip with some really good views of the city.","Written July 20, 2018"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Go after dark,"To avoid too many people we went to the top before sun set. Unfortunately, the weather was not with us and it was windy and raining. The shuttle bus from the tram station is relatively small so it will not be able to cope with large input of guests. The day view from the mountain was ok. A restaurant is present but was closed during our visit in the afternoon. There was not many seats so after seeing all the views from different angle we decided to retreat from the top to go somewhere warmer.

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,"Nice view, convenient access from Sapporo","The reason why you should go to the top of Mt. Moiwa is that there is not really any reason why you should not. Not every city has a ropeway up a hill from which you can get a great view, but Sapporo does. So why not go up there and enjoy the view?

It is very convenient to get to the top and not too expensive either. You can take the shuttle bus from the tram station, but it is really only a short walk. The ropeway and cable car is a nice ride. There is friendly staff in uniform everywhere who bow and show you where to go.

Up at the top you get a reasonably impressive view of the city and the surrounding mountains. There is even a vending machine where you can get a hot coffee to warm up your hands if they are freezing from taking all the photos. You can buy souvenirs with the cute Mt. Moiwa mascot at the middle station, but they seem overpriced.",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Highlight of our Japan trip,"I always wanted to visit Sapporo, Hokkaido for their cute food and beer even though I dont drink. Some people say that they have good parks.
So I prepared for parks itinerary while in Sapporo. But when I touched down Sapporo last week, I read review that Mt. Moiwa is one of best three night views in Hokkaido.

I used google to give direction to go to Mt. Moiwa, suggested as follow: From Nishi Juitchome subway, we needed to go out from subway station and found for tram to go to Chuotoshokan-Mae stop and walked to ropeway station for 15 mins (The walking road was nice but it was uphill). BUT it was wrong.
One stop before Chuotoshokan-Mae, there was Ropeway Iriguchi (which I saw it but I thought it was for another ropeway, -my bad) and from that stop we only needed to cross the street to find FREE shuttle bus to go up to Mt. Moiwa ropeway station. We found that correct route and way after we went back walking down to tramp stop station (this time to ropeway Iriguchi) and saw that free shuttle bus stop.
Actually it has been written by some bloggers but since I didn't prepare for Mt. Moiwa, I did miss it.
I felt sorry for my mom to experience uphill walking in windy and cold.

Ok, so from Mt. Moiwa ropeway, we bought ropeway ticket return Yen 1.100. Once you were in ropeway you need to go to left side so you can see beautiful Sapporo night city view from above. The ropeway stop at Midway station and we countinued by bus to go to observatory of Mt. Moiwa. The view from ropeway was beautiful but the view from the observatory was breathtaking and sooo windy and cold. We even couldn't dare to stay longer for taking pictures. It is indeed one of one of best three night views in Hokkaido.

Our time in Sapporo, Hokkaido was so limited and now I'm so looking forward to have chance to go back to Hokkaido.
The park was nice and I can imagine myself in future at that park for cherry blossom.",

I'm super impressed being someone in the hospitality industry. Thumbs upx3,"Written April 23, 2018"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Mt Moiwa,"This place is a must see regardless of crowd. We went there in early October. Do bring warm clothes because it is cold and windy up there. We took the street car (tram) from Susukino to Ropeway Iriguchi station (170 yen). From there there is a free shuttle bus that goes to the lower ropeway station, or you can walk the way (not very far). Then you take the Ropeway to the top (1700 yen roundtrip with mini cable car). This is the one I would suggest especially if you intend to go at night, so you don't have to walk down. It opens from 10:30am to 10 pm and from 12pm to 10pm (winter). You can find all the details in English on their website. The view over Sapporo is amazing... and if you go around sunset, even better...which we did. It was really windy and cold but we loved the view and felt it was all worth it.
They have signs on their walking path to be aware of bears!!! hence the ropeway! They also have a restaurant and some souvenir shops.

Check their website for maintenance time when service is suspended!",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Lovely night views,"Wasnt that easy to find the route up considering its one of the main tourist attractions. There were no signage of directions from the nearest streetcar stop (Denshajigyosho-Mae). However, once you've braved the 15 minutes trek to the ropeway building, it's a nice ride up to the summit. We went at 7 pm, so we missed the day time crowd and the after dinner crowd.
The night views are very nice on a clear night. In mid April, there's still some snow from midway up.
There's a bell you can ring at the summit... For fun 😄
1.5 hours is more than sufficient for this attraction.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Incredible and highly recommended!,"We visited here at night right after the sunset (I wish we could have seen the sunset). It was an incredible experience. Riding the ski lift to the top of the mountain, you could see all of Sapporo with all the buildings and lights. There is so much life in Sapporo! The first ski lift was about 4-5 minutes and then you take another short ride to the very top.

You have to pay for the lifts and it is about $6 USD per person for the round trip tickets... well worth the price.

Once we got to the very top of the mountain you walk up the stairs to the top floor where you can walk outside and view the whole city. It was incredibly cold when we went and it was also snowing, which was really nice... though the visibility was low. Even with low visibility, it was still an incredible experience. I would like to return for sunrise and sunset one day, if possible.

They also have a general store and restaurant inside the building. It is a really nice place and certainly something you should do if you visit Sapporo!",

The beginners slope is not as well arranged for learners as other ski fields I’ve been to, so not really the best place to start for our novices. Getting a private ski instructor who spoke English was a struggle, though successful and very expensive, and reading most kanji signage was not English tourist friendly either. No snowboards are permitted. We were there on a Monday, and no catering was available, other than vending machine drinks. Then on her last run of the day, the 10 year old novice fell over, yet again, but this time resulting in a spiral fracture of one of her tibias. I never saw the ski patrol folks anywhere other than sitting in their office. I skied her down the slope to the first aid post where little was done. Only found out it was a fracture two days later after our return flight, in an Australian hospital!","Written April 2, 2018"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Great Place for Night Views,"I heard of this place through here and I just had to check it out. I went close to 9 pm this past Wednesday night, hoping there would be a smaller crowd. We made it before the last free shuttle and we were rewarded with spectacular views! I recommend a good jacket for this time of year even though it’s not snowing as much because the winds up at the top made it pretty chilly! To get there from Susukino, we took the streetcar to the free shuttle (12 stops), took the shuttle (5 minutes), then took the cable car to the top. It’s definit worth checking out at night!","Written April 1, 2018"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Amazing View,"You can access the peak of Mt. Moiwa by riding the ropeway and then transferring to the cable car. The ropeway that departs from Moiwa Sanroku Station travels 1,200 meters in five minutes. The ride includes the stunning view of Ishikari Bay in the distance past the cityscape, providing clear, unobstructed views of Sapporo. Next, transfer to the cable car called Mo-risu Car, which brings you to the peak after traveling through the forest. Be sure to check out the views from both the ropeway and cable car.

The place had an amount of tourists and locals.

You can purchase locks at their gift shop for 1000yen. But I recommend you to get locks from your own country or at the 100 yen shop. If you get your own locks, bring your own markers as they only provide markers for people who buy their locks.

You couldn't stay out long but ringing the bell gave a nice photo opportunity . Cable car was cramped ,but if you were by the window you had a good view. Free shuttle bus and tram ride to the foot of the mountain worked well. Food very disappointing , the restaurant was full and the little counter served hot drinks, a poor range of snacks and no where inside to sit. The few seats there were taken up with people ignoring the view sat on phones. A missed opportunity maybe on the middle section for a better cafe, we would have stayed longer. Fireworks ... Well we had seen a poster and thought there would be fireworks, no mention on line , no other posters , no signs when we arrived so we walked around and headed back down, only to see fireworks from the cable car ,very disappointing, should have been better advertised!","Written February 10, 2018"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Pretty nice views of Sapporo albeit a little expensive,"Those going during winter may want to keep a lookout for the shuttle to the ropeway base station near the streetcar stop instead of walking because it can get really cold trekking up the hill.

The views are good up there if you go on a clear day (during winter). We also saw locals ski down from the mid-level station and trek down from the top which is interesting.

Why I feel the fee charged is expensive is because there aren't much facilities and this place is rather small so you wouldn't spend much time there and will leave probably after a few pictures.","Written February 5, 2018"

The mountains all around Sapporo are beautiful, but the coolest thing was seeing Ishikari Bay spread out below to the west. The map of Hokkaido felt like it had come to life in front of us. The ropeway ride was really fun--we could see a man walking his dog in the snow below us--and I wish we had more time to stay up at the top. We will have to go again for the famous night view. We took the streetcar and walked to the Ropeway, arriving a minute after the free shuttle bus. It is a pleasant uphill walk if you don't want to wait for the bus.","Written January 7, 2018"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,A view out.,"There's the ropeway to a midway station, then a cable car up. You can get tickets to just the midway station, but you can't really see much from there, and there's no dedicated viewing platform. Pay the extra amount to go all the way to the top, and you will be rewarded with a panoramic view over the city. Great to see it and the lights at night. Beware of slippery frost on the ground of the viewing area in cold weather though, and bring warm clothing. It was about 2 degrees C outside when we were there.
Also, despite the brochure saying the ropeway cars and cable cars have been designed to give you a great view of the surrounds as you ascend/descend, realistically, you will be packed in with over 20 other people (closer to 30), and unless you're right on the edges, you won't see much.","Written November 4, 2017"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Better than Mt Hakodate,"Sapporo Mount Moiwa

This tourist destination is recommended. You may go up the peak either in the day or at night. I think the night view is even better than that of Mt Hakodate. According to the brochure, during the “Nightscape Summit 2015 in Kobe”, Sapporo Mt Moiwa was chosen along with Nagasaki and Kobe as one of the three most beautiful nightscapes of Japan.

To take the tram (streetcar) and alight at Ropeway Iriguchi station. Walk along the main road with Mt. Moiwa signboard to the shuttle bus pick up point on the left. The free shuttle bus will ferry you to the ropeway station. If you are a senior above 65 years, there is a discounted ticket available. The ropeway climbs from the base of the mountain to the transfer station. From here, you will be transferred to an unique twin cable cars to the peak.

The observatory at the peak offer you spectacular view of Sapporo city. The view is especially beautiful after sunset. Mount Moiwa offers five mountain trails too. The shortest is 2.4 km and you may hike in casual clothing. You may wish to venture into it.","Written September 16, 2017"

Moiwa early morning from the Jiekaibyoin Mae Course Parking Lot for a moderate hike that took about one hour to complete. Once done, I emerged at the observatory on a beautiful sunny day with 360 degree views of the entire area that stretched for miles. Since I went early, there were few people and it was quiet, which made for a good time of reflection and calm. On the way down, I decided to take the Ropeway cable car down to Sanroku and a short walk to the tram line. Overall best views you will find (and if you take the cable car, it is an inexpensive ride with the most calming background music ever).",

If I do this again I would recommend taking the cable car to the middle section (return), and just walk the last little bit up and down yourself as that part is very short.

I took a street tram to the Mt Moiwa shuttle bus stop and then took the free shuttle up to the building. I thought that the tickets for the ropeway and cable car were a bit pricey.

At the middle stop, there's a souvenir shop with some cool stuff. There's a lock fence at the summit, like the one in Paris. You can buy the locks and markers for it here.

I went during the week so the summit was not crowded. There were mostly older people. I also saw a lot of people in hiking gear so I think it's possible to hike there.

Now you can buy a one way ticket for 900yen but I don't know how you would get back down. I think there is a hiking/walking path but I am not sure. Once you reach the top of the ropeway you then have to take a cable car which takes uou to the top of the mountain. From the top it's a great view of the city with all of the lights twinkling from the city.

Even though the views from the top were super foggy (really couldn't see anything), the views of the city as we ascended the mountain were clear and really nice. Even going outside was cold but rather pleasant. Other than the view though, there is not much to do here apart from the shop.

We went during the afternoon, so we didn't get to see the bright lights of the Sapporo landscape, which is rated as top 3 in all of Japan. We recommend a total of 1.5 hours for this trip. You may have dinner there, but the food is average. They are selling the view, which you may see at the observatory deck.

If you want to save some money and enjoy some hiking, may I suggest getting a one way ticket up to the top and walk your way down, it takes around 30 minutes at a leisurely pace and soaking in the landscape.

Ring the bell, just remember to cover your ears. With my height, my head was right next to the bell, which leaves ringing for some time.","Written May 20, 2017"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,May better going there at night,"I'm going there at noon during the cloudy day, so nothing much to see. I suggest to go there at night so you can see the view better, but it depends on the weather.","Written May 17, 2017"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Surprisingly good,Was expecting it to be a bit underwhelming but well worth the trip. Straight up and down in 45 mins from the Base station. DON'T GO EARLY. The first car up is at 10.30 am.,"Written May 15, 2017"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Minimal views at the top on a foggy day,"We came here on a cold day, got to the desk to buy tickets and was so sad when we were told that the views up the top were very foggy and we wouldn't be able to see anything. They have live cam (which it turns out is pretty accurate). We had taken the tram and then the mini bus to get to the rope way thing, so we decided what the hell. We were going up anyway.

Even though the views from the top were super foggy (really couldn't see anything), the views of the city as we ascended the mountain were clear and really nice. Even going outside was cold but rather pleasant. Other than the view though, there is not much to do here apart from the shop.

I guess my tip is that the live cam is really accurate. The view was pretty much exactly as the camera portrayed it. But you will probably get lovely city views on the way up to the mountain anyway.","Written May 15, 2017"

Still we preserved. Then another 20 mins to the first tram. Then when we reached the top, the horror descended upon us as the snake of people waiting to get down was like more than an hour long. Didn't help as we were hungry. So while the view is fantastic, the whole experience didn't go down well at all. The whole trip took 2.5 hours which probably would be just over an hour. Be warned.",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Great hike to do on a clear day,"Definitely recommend this hike while in Sapporo. Took us about an hour to go up; slow and steady with no stops. The same going back down. The views at the top were fabulous. Could see the Sea of Japan from the top, and heaps of snow capped peaks in the distance.

The trailhead isn't from the ropeway! You need to get off the tram at stop 14. Walk towards the mountain. At the trailhead, there is some public toilets as well as a large three headed Buddha statue. See that and you'll know you've arrived.

We had a few snow patches to cross in early May, but nothing too serious. There is a place at the trailhead to wash your boots when you have finished (stiff brushes provided), which was great. There are also a few walking poles there, that you can use, then put back when you are finished, if you didn't bring your own.

We packed a picnic lunch for the top, which was great.","Written May 3, 2017"

The next night we drive to the ropeway station and go up through Sanroku.

The view is really amazing. We didnt stay there long as it was really cold. But i think it worths the money and the time we spent.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Stunning views,"Worth the trip for the views alone. The beginning of the ropeway is easy to get to from the centre of the city via the Ropeway Iriguchi streetcar stop and the ropeway itself runs every 15 minutes. You get a short talk pointing out famous landmarks on the way up (Japanese only unfortunately) and there are amenities and a restaurant at the top.

Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that 1700 yen seemed a bit steep given how short the journey is.","Written March 18, 2017"

Very easy access taking the city's only street car and then the free shuttle bus to the cable car station. As roads can be quite icy, it is highly recommended to take the shuttle bus during the winter than to walk up to the station.

The view from taking the cable car up was great, could see the snow covered roofs of the city buildings. There's a shop at the midstation before taking the morris car to the top. The night view was stunning on a clear night, full view of the city down below.

For those who want to enjoy the view longer and in comfort, there is a fancy restaurant there too.",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,See the whole of Sapporo,"Mt Moiwa (Moiwayama) is right inside Sapporo with two lifts, hiking trails, skiing, and neat views of the whole city.

How to get there: from the central city, take a streetcar to the Ropeway station. You can walk about 600m to the entrance - turn left when you see the sign for ropeway parking- or take a free shuttle about 50m from the streetcar. The entrance is labeled and looks like an office building. When we went, the path was icy, and some of it is uphill; not safe for elderly or very young children.

How to tickets: Go to the fourth floor via elevator or stairs to the right. You will be deposited in a ticket line. The workers speak English, and you can use a credit card. The cost for round trip tickets on both the doorway and mini cable car was ¥1700 per adult. There were coupons in the Sapporo guide we were given at the airport; alas, we did not know and did. It bring them.

How to get to the top: the rope way and mini cable cars leave every 15 minutes. The first trip takes about 5 minutes, get a view facing down to watch the city unfurl beneath you! Then, you can buy items at the shop, leave for hiking (we did not try it on a February night), or go up the mini cable car. The second trip is just about 2 minutes. Go out the Rooftop observation deck.

What to do: Get your picture ringing the bell on top of Sapporo. Look at the pictures indicating key sites in the city and natural landmarks. You can eat at a restaurant at the top (we didn't) and head back down.

If you can't get to ant Moiwa and still want to see the city, you can go to observation decks in JR tower near Sapporo station or the clock tower in Odari park. Neither is nearly as high, though.","Written February 6, 2017"

You may purchase a one day pass (Dosanko Pass 310Y) for the streetcar if you are travelling during weekend or holidays for unlimited ride for a day. From Ropeway Irigiuchi, the free shuttle bus to the Mt. Moiwa Ropeway is within walking distance. The free shuttle bus was pretty efficient that we took no time to wait for it during our trip to and fro. Once you reached there, you may take lift up to the ticket counter and we found discount coupon at HIS website prior to our trip.So we get 500 yen of discount and free kairo (hot pack) for roundway trip (1200 yen). On the day we went, the weather was pretty good and sun was shinning brightly but it still cold. Once you reached the top, you can see the whole view of Sapporo. Do take note there is also bell of Happiness and padlock for lovers. Remember to check whether the ropeway is operating or not during the day of your visit to avoid any disappointment. If you wish to see the night view during winter, it is best to go during 16.00 to capture both day and night and also sunset view. You will never want to miss the view here if you have come to Hokkaido. It is one of the best attractions here other than Mt. Hakodate.","Written February 3, 2017"

Do bring a jacket as it gets chilly and there are some strong winds. If you have no time to go out of the city and just want a feel of snow, there's quite a bit of snow on the mountains. I saw parents bringing their kids out to take photos and play around in the snow.
Check out the panoramic views! You can even attach a padlock lock to the railings and ring the bell. It is supposed to bring lovers good luck and happiness. Drinks and food in winter are a little scarce. I remember having to crowd around a counter as the restaurant was closed.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,"Sapporo from ""far above"" :)","Saw this city from three different heights: one on top of the JR Tower above Sapporo Station, one on top of Mt. Moere at Moerenuma Park to the north of the city, and one on top of this mountain to the south of the city; but if you want an ""absolute panoramic"" view of the city, the big deck on top of this mountain is where you come although the location of the mountain being in the southwest of the city means you'll have to look ""north & east"" to see most of the city (there are really just mountains to the west & there's nothing much to the south either, but be sure to look to the southwest for some ""interesting shapes"" on the slopes & at the foot of some mountains there). And yes, besides taking in the phenomenal views, there are things to see & do on the top deck such as the bell (I guess for love or peace), the love locks & the love sign (for great photo-ops), and in the building right below which has a cafe and a movie room where you can watch a nice short movie (just about 15 minutes, but it's ""3-D"") about the history of the Sapporo area from the prehistoric time (when the area was kind of like a sea) to the present. Also, be sure to step outside the building and check out the little lovely shrine building (like hexagonal-shaped) on the west side beside the big satellite tower.

You could take both cable cars (the first one from the bottom station to the mid station and the second one from the mid station to the top station) costing a total of like Y1,800 or you can save a few hundred yens by doing the stretch from the mid station to the top and vice-versa ""on foot"" (I only did that part on foot on my way down which took only about 10 minutes and saved me like Y300, but I wished then that I had walked up as well from the mid station after finding out how easy the paved path was with a gentle slope to the top; would have saved Y600 instead of just Y300).

I took the tram (or streetcar) from Nishiyonchome Station (just like two blocks south of Odori Park in downtown) to Ropeway Iriguchi Station where there's a shuttle bus (free of charge) just across the street from that station, and a short 5-minute ride on it will bring you to the bottom station for the cable car which takes you to the mid station where I suggest just to walk up on the easy path (as mentioned above although the way up that I didn't do by taking the second cable car instead might take a bit more than 10 minutes).",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,A great place for Sapporo night view,"We walked from Sapporo Station to Streetcar Station_Nishi yon chome (Stop nr. SC01) near Odori Park. The ride from SC01 to Ropeway iriguchi (Stop nr. SC10) took about 30 minutes . After getting off the streetcar, we crossed the road to the left, walked about 1 minute and found the Mt. Moiwa Shuttle Bus Stop. The free shuttle operated at regular intervals between the Shuttle Bus Stop and the Mt. Moiwa Ropeway Station. Timetable was displayed at the station.
At Mt. Moiwa Ropeway Station, we bought return tickets to/from the summit which we had to change to ""Morris Car""(mini cable car) half way. It was completely dark when we reached the summit and the panorama night view of Sapporo was so stunning. It's definitely worth to visit Mt. Moiwa at night.

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Need a good weather,"On our last day in Sapporo, we went to Mt Moiwa. Unfortunately, it was rainy and did not get much view of the area. From the photo gallery, we saw what we missed out on. There was some 3D sessions on Sapporo which was quite good, just that they were all in Japanese.","Written September 14, 2016"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Nice view,We went to Mt. Moiwa for the night view of Sapporo. It was quite nice but was very crowded (I think it was a public holiday at the time). I believe there is a free shuttle from downtown Sapporo that takes you to the cable car station at the bottom of the mountain. We travelled by car to the mid-mountain station which cost 600 yen for a family sized car. Then it's another 600 yen per person to ride the cable car to the top.,"Written August 30, 2016"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,One of the highlights of my trip in Hokkaido,"I personally like the whole concept of reaching the mountain top observatory with a cable car. The view from the top was just unbelievably stunning. As we reached the top at around 8PM, the lights that decorate Sapporo just looked fantastic. Practically everyone in the cable car couldn't stop saying how beautiful the view was when it starts ascending to the top. Keep in mind that you need to wait for 20-30 minutes to purchase the ticket(s) to get to the top (or 2nd station). I definitely recommend going all the way to the top, which will cost you 1.700Yen (round trip). Going to the second station will cost you 1.100Yen (round trip). Trust me, the view that you get worth every waiting minute.",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Top of the Mountain...... But Terrible Customer Services.,It was a typical top of the mountain view. We drove up instead of paying Ropeway which is a cable car to the top. It is much cheaper. The toll cost was 600 Yens as compared to 1560 yens per person. But we still need to pay again before they take you up by tram to the top of the mountain. We ended up picking up some local souvenirs. the cashier does not speak english and she made sure you know as well!...so don't ask any questions... We picked up some stuff by mistakes but she gave us a dirty look... Not impressed at all. But this is Japan... I recommend a night viewing instead...,"Written August 4, 2016"

It takes around one hour for us to arrive the shuttle bus station but the shuttle bus comes frequently like every 10-15mins and convenient to go to cable car station. It takes two cable cars to reach the top and if you try to only take one cable car to the half way. You can't see the whole view only part of it because the view will be blocked by the cable car station. Remember to buy the souvenir first before taking the second cable car to the top of its close to 9pm. The night view is quite amazing if the weather is good. It totally deserves your time to go to take a look. It has been selected to one of the new top three best night view cities.","Written July 26, 2016"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Panaromic view of Sapporo city and surrounding mountain range,"A must go place in Sapporo. Evening time is the best time to go on a sunny day. As the sun shone on the city during sunset, the view was spectacular on evening sunshine reflection.
Since we rented a car we decided to drive up and paid a toll of 660 yen instead of 1700 yen per person using ropeway which is really expensive. Unfortunately we can't drive all the way up to the top. From the car park, we can either hike up which is free and a bit of exercise or take less than a minute mini cable car up at 600 yen per person return trip. If it's a nice weather I would suggest hike up as it wasn't that high.
It was quite cold and windy up there. Prepare jacket even on a summer day. We stayed until sunset is over but left before totally dark because it was too cold.","Written July 13, 2016"

There is also a shop selling foodstuff and souvenir items in the middle part while waiting your cable car ride to the top.,"Written June 30, 2016"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Mt Moiwa Good Tourist Place,Mt Moiwa is located right within Sapporo. Easily accessible by electric street tram at a very reasonable price you can get on or get off along the main Susukino street. A 2 stage cable car takes visitors right to the summit. Clear excellent view of Sapporo city skyline. Very pleasant and enjoyable cable car ride. They provide free shuttle bus services from the street car stop. The street car drivers even provide visitors with discount coupons. DO NOT TAKE A LOCAL TOUR TO VISIT MT MOIWA. Very easy expensive and lots of spoken Japanese. If you find your way via the underground pedestrian walk or by subway to Susukino you can take the charming street car right to Mt Moiwa all for a fraction of the price of a local tour. Besides you can take your dinner at Susukino and enjoy the very charming circle street car ride. Highly recommended,"Written June 29, 2016"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,What a view,"We went just as the sun was setting on a clear night so the view was fantastic. The stars were out and we spent quite a while despite the windy chill. It can get quite crowded. And if you don't understand Japanese, skip the planetarium show.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Crowded cable car on a cold windy night,"We drove up the Mount Moiwa sightseeing road. We had to pay a toll for driving up this scenic road. However, we didn't realize this sightseeing road only brings us half way up, where we have to park our car & take a cable car that cost ¥600 per person to get to the top for viewing the city night view.

We were going up when the sun was setting. The attendant at the cable car station packed us like sardines into the cable car when going up. It was uncomfortable during the short ride. Long queues also formed when coming down but the cable car station increased the frequency of the cable car to cope with the crowd.

It was very windy & cold when we were up there. it may look spectacular to some but as for us, having been to scenic lookouts in quite a few cities & countries, many of them which are free, this seems costly & not so convenient.","Written June 27, 2016"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Excellent night view.. cold too,"Although the cable car rides up were nothing to shout about (not cheap either), the night views were worthwhile.

There is a shuttle bus from this place to the ropeway station and refer my photos for time table and location. However, ropeway station is less than 1km by walk but good to use the free shuttle if you are lazy to walk on a hilly road. Round ticket is 1700 and must go to the upper most station because nothing to see in the middle station. Cable car service is available untile around 9 pm. The view is simply amazing.",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,A must visit!!,"I visited 北海道神宮, Hokkaidō Jingū first and went back to Maruyamakoen Station to take bus 10 or 11 (210Yen) to Mt. Moiwa, around 15-20 mins bus ride. It doesn't stop directly in front of mt.moiwa, you have to walk up the hill for 5mins? If u don't know where to alight, u can approach the driver and ask him to inform you when you reach your destination or u can use google maps.
Or from Susukino, take Sapporo's only streetcar line to ""Ropeway Iriguchi"" station (25 minutes, 170 yen, frequent departures). From there, a free shuttle bus operates to the lower ropeway station (5 minutes, departs every 20 minutes).
Alternatively, the Mount Moiwa Ropeway can be reached in a five minute walk from the Ropeway Iriguchi streetcar stop.

From the Ropeway Mountain Base Station to the Mountainside Station in a cable car, takes roughly five minutes, plenty of time to take in the scenery all around you.
Once you arrive at the Mountainside Station, you can take a break at the gift shop and change here to the ""Morris Car,"" it carries passengers to the Summit Station in less than two minutes.
Once at the top, the Summit Station's rooftop observatory offers a 360-degree view, including the city of Sapporo and the aforementioned nearby mountains. There's also a French restaurant at the Summit Station and it allows every party to enjoy a window seat and the wonderful view of they city.

You can also write any commemoration message on the padlock and leave it on the third floor of the summit observatory. So bring one along with you or u can get one at the Star Hall!

This park is enormous, best way to see everything without taking forever is to hire a bike. It's around 500Yen for 3-4 hours. There are designated bike paths in the park, however you can take the bike in certain areas where there is lot of foot traffic. There are lot of bike stops where you can park and have a walk through different attractions.

Great place to go to escape the city for a few hours, especially on a lovely sunny day, whether your a couple or a family, there's something to do for everyone. When we went, there wasn't too many flowers blooming. This place must be exploding with people during cherry blossom season....

Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Great family day out destination,"We spent the day out here and it was one of our best days of the trip. We hired bikes at the entrance near the station and rode right around the park. There was plenty of choice of bikes ranging from kids 18in right up to full adult sizes and most (if not all) had baskets to place a bag in on the front, there were even some tandem bikes. The grounds are lovely, beautiful floral areas, a lovely coastal road to ride along and some incredible playgrounds around the grounds. There is a small free zoo and also some paid activities like go karts and mini golf. There are drink vending machines scattered around the park so if you get thirsty out on your ride you don't have to head back to a restaurant/cafe to refresh. It's worth taking the time to head out here with your family, it's a wonderful day out.","Written December 2, 2018"
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Disappointing...there was no vast cosmos field. Nov 2018...,I used my unlimited bus/train/ JR one day pass to access Uminonakamichi PArk. I was there 915am. The park opened at 930am. I was travelling solo and was interested in the flower gardens. The park was so vast and I can't ride a bike so I started walking to the left side. I reached the rose garden but roses were not in bloom. There was a small group of pink cosmos. The rows of yellow ginko trees were amazing. Fountains and lots of areas for bike riders. I passed by a small zoo. Good educational fun for children. Lots of nice views but they were just too far apart if one is not on bike.There was a food area near the mini golf. I took an udon lunch there. There were lots of areas for famiy fun and activities. I left the PArk at 1pm.,"Written December 2, 2018"
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Must see for families!,"I loved every minute of this park!

When you arrive, there are many different gates or places to choose from to start your day. Each gate has a place to rent bicycles and they even have helmets for the little ones. We started at the West Gate which was opposite of where we were heading so we biked the entirety of the park. We rented bikes for my eight year old and myself (with a seat attached for my four year old). The trails for the biking were safe along with parking. Each bike came with a lock so that you can keep track of your rental and not worry about someone taking yours (which I don't believe would happen).

here is a small zoo inside. I would skip it if you are looking to feed the animals. All of them lie down the majority of the time and don't really interact with the crowd. Definitely visit the park areas. One has two bouncy clouds! Each one has different age groups but no adults are allowed to bounce. Loads of slides, sand/water to build sand castles and things to do to keep your little busy and have them burn energy. They did have go carts and a maze but those you had to pay extra to do. We may do them when we go back! We arrived around 12 p.m. and didn't depart until maybe 4 or 4:30 p.m. Definitely will return! Will also try to the aquarium!","Written November 9, 2018"

Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Great park ..one of the best in Japan,"This is a amazing park. We took JR to Kashi from Hakata Station.
From Kashi there is special train from platform 4 to park.

After getting down you can hit the park or aquarium. We decided to go to park first as marine world closes art 9:30.

You can buy ticket with and without swimming pool. If you change your mind after getting inside park you just need to pay the difference.

Balance bike and bike with peddles can be rented just near the main gate. Park is too big. There are buses but frequency is less. There are food options but quality is so so.

Swimming pool has different sections as per height. There are body guards in kid section. Its challenging to cover everything in one day as park is too big. So better decide what to visit as per age group.","Written August 7, 2018"
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Phenomenally fun and fantastic value for money,"If you are in Fukuoka with young children and its a beautiful sunny day - head here. If you have seen the other reviews, you will no doubt already know that this is a large park. But large is an understatement - it is absolutely sprawling.

First - the logistics. You can get here by stopping at either Uminonakamichi Station, or Saitozaki Station, which is approximately 45 - 50 minutes from Hakata Station.. Stop at Uminonakamichi if you want to hit the Whale Cloud / Go Karting / Slides area first. If you prefer to get closer to the Dolphin Playground and Animal area, stop at Saitozaki instead.

It is possible to rent bicycles or walk the park. We chose to walk as we had a pleasant summer day. While there is an internal shuttle bus, its not very frequent (we were there on a weekday and it was on an hourly basis).

You can check the website to see a picture of the map and you should do so if you have young kids in tow as this place is so large, that you cannot actually get from one attraction to another without quite a bit of walking / cycling. You will be able to see the list of attractions from the website but what is not obvious from the website is the incredible quality and high standards of maintenance this park has at every attraction. The Whale Cloud which is like a huge bouncy was an incredible amount of fun, the Go Kart (which is payable) is well worth the money and you can choose between a Bumpy Route and a Smooth Route - and you get on these motorised cars and drive them on a short, but fun route. The playground with long, fun slides were fantastic. The Waterside Playpark offers a more challenging play area for slightly older children with rope like challenges, the Sky Dolphin play area had more slides and rope play areas.

While the animal area is not large, it was very well maintained, and the animals well looked after. You get to feed the goats , sheep, ducks and swans (food can be purchased at 100 yen) and pet the Guinea Pigs. You can touch the rabbits and turtles as well. There were beautiful flamingoes, monkeys, capybara, peacocks, kangaroos, turtles, cranes, rabbits and many more animals.

On top of all the kid friendly exhibits and play areas, the grounds are expansive, beautiful, and even though we spent 5 hours in the park, we barely managed to cover a quarter of the park.

The one thing that you need to note when coming here, is that there is a lack of food. I am not sure if this is the case on weekends as there certainly were some food areas designated and there were food pictures on the website but they were not open while we were there. Drinks are available in the form of vending machines all over the park but food was not. There was a snack store at the animal area but only selling donuts and ice cream.

This was the kids best day in Fukuoka and their most memorable. It was an awesome day for the adults too. One of the best playground and park we have ever seen.","Written June 17, 2018"
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Lovely park for all the family,"A huge park, so cycling is the best way to go around. Easy to rent bicycles and enjoy the ride. Stop and park at designated bicycle areas. Park grounds are vast, with a beautiful garden of roses, and many areas and has something for everyone . Great place for a family outing. Journey out here is long but worth it if you have the time. We spent the morning here, and then walked to the Marine World for lunch.","Written June 14, 2018"
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,A Wonderful Place on a Nice Spring Day,"It is easy to catch a train to this park with only 1 change. I was at the start of April when all cherry trees were still in bloom. In addition, many displays of spring flowers were around. I didn't hire a bike, but just had a walk to see all flowers and also visited the small Zoo. The day was sunny, the views are very colourful, but for sure, it is probably a better place for families with kids.I also think that it is great to visit during this time of the year, but will be just grass at some other times. I spent about 4 hrs there and pretty much covered all I wanted to see. While monkeys and flamingos were nice to see in the Zoo, the area for grey kangaroos is too small and they definitely do not have much room to enjoy their life there and were just lying.This was sad, as we used to see these animals roaming free in Australia.","Written June 1, 2018"
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Great Park,"Little far out there but worth the time and effort to get out there to spend a sunny afternoon. Yes, like other reviewers have said, this place is huge. Don't worry, you can rent bicycles to get yourself around on the pathway at a reasonable price.
There is an animal zoo, flower garden, jungle gym for children, water pool play area and probably lots other stuff that we didn't have the chance to see or do.
If you bring food, just remember to stow it away or keep it with you when you park your bike. There are birds that will devour it before you return.","Written May 23, 2018"

The free zoo was great! You can buy food to feed some of the animals, though be mindful of the signs as they will tell you which animals shouldn't be fed (e.g. the monkeys and the donkeys should not be fed).
We hired a bicycle for the day, which was great fun. I think it was about 400 Yen? You can switch bicycles throughout the day so we switched to a tandem bike for some random fun towards the end of the day.","Written December 7, 2017"

Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Had a blast and should have spent 2 days at least,"We are a family of 4 with 2 young kids (5 & 7). We arrived at around 11am. First rented each of us a bicycle to get around this huge park. They are all sorts of bicycles for all ages (some with supporting wheels, or baby seat). You'll surely find one suitable. Bicycles are basically must-have in this park as it is too big for walking from one place to another. We visite the Forest House which allows to do free wooden crafts. They provided you with all the tools you need. And it is air-conditioned, very important in hot summer. Afterwards, we spend 2 hours at the Sunshine pool which is only open during summer. The kids had a blast and would not want to leave. We didn't managed to visit other parts of the park. Too bad it is closes early.

The Sunshine pool has all necessary facilities like lockers, changing room, shower and many eateries. Be sure to bring a small water proof bag to hold money.",
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Nice Big Park with various Activities,"I would have given it ""Good"", but TripAdvisor goes from ""Average"" straight to ""Very Good"".

We took the ferry to come here. When you arrive, you can rent bicycles in the same building where you can buy your return ticket for the ferry but here you can rent only until 3 pm. Wait until you reach the park (if you were going there) and you can rent bikes until 6 pm.

The park is quite big, so bicycles are quite useful to move around.

In the park, you can find a kind of mini-zoo with different species of monkeys, some kangaroos, some wallabies, and many other kinds of anymals.

There is a playground for kids. There is a kind of small amusemment park, or it may be more accurate to say that there are a few rides.

You can buy food and drinks at a few places; they have vending machines for drinks and there are toilets, which are free. Food and drinks are a bit expensive, so you might want to bring something to drink before leaving town.

Initially, we wanted to visit around the park after visiting there, but we got surprised by the rain, so we took a ferry back earlier than intended.","Written August 15, 2017"

At the park, they have play structures suitable for many ages and an eating area where you can grab some quick dishes (pork-broth ramen and similar things). Bring lots of cash in the form of coins and 1000 yen notes – you buy food and tickets from machines. Pools open in July, but there is a wading pool. The animal area is great, the kids loved walking inside the kangaroo and capybara enclosures, getting close-up experiences. The flowers are plentiful and lovely. I only wish we would could have had more time, as we were rushing through the park a bit during the 4 hours we were there. Plan for a whole day outing and bring snacks, plenty of water, swimwear and towels during the warm months!

It took us a while to find the West Gate, which is the main entrance to this massive park. I reckon it could rival the size of London's Hyde Park!

My daughter wanted to hit the Sky Dolphin first, and this is by far the best playground I've been to. It's ultra clean and superbly fun. The slide isn't just a sheet of metal but a layer of tiny rollers to whizz you down the three storey structure.

While the kids were at the playground for an hour and half, my father went off to the chip and putt area, which cost him only a meager ¥400 for the 18 hole ""course"".

We then headed to the zoo area which seriously impressed us. There were a whole bunch of animals but they weren't kept in miserable cages. Rather they roamed freely in enclosures where children could interact with the animals. The impressive thing about the Japanese is the incredible sense of hygiene and cleanliness. Every enclosure had hand sanitizers for kids to use after they have handled the animals, and sinks to thoroughly wash down hands with infant safe soap.

We spent the whole day there yesterday and even skipped lunch and we still couldn't get enough. We are headed back tomorrow again cos we just can't get enough.

Just a tip - the F&B in this park isn't very comprehensive so pack a picnic lunch if you intend to head there for the day.",

We saw it briefly on trip advisor, but wehn we saw how far away it was from Hakata (where we were staying) we almost didn't bother. Glad we did! The trains were a bit hard to figure out, as they were on the JR line, rather than standard, and the switch for trains in Kashii was pretty confusing -regional lines seem to presume you know what you're doing- basically you head from Kashii to Umi No Nakamichi and it's the second last stop. Don't fret if you go to far, it's a 10 minutes wait and the train reverses. However we had to switch trains the stop before Umi no Nakamichi - not sure why, but the captain wandered through, spotted us and directed us to opposite side :)

We clearly went in off peak, but had a blast. Hire a bike definitely but don't leave any food in your baskets when you get to each stop - it will be taken by the birds - there's warning signs everywhere.

We hired a 2 person bike and you just follow the blue lines - there's maps everywhere with where to go and what to stop at. We spent about 3 hours there, and missed most of the sights as we spent the majority of the time enjoying the ride and playing at the forest park - which is essentially a massive petting zoo. Keep in mind we are 2x 30 something year olds, but it was great. The area was massive, the creatures were clean and there were things there I'd never heard of. There are hand washing stations anywhere, so don't pat anything unless you have thoroughly washed. And there are also some cool vending machines that give you these odd biscuit things that snap onhalf and are full of food pellets. The animals know that sound of the machine and head straight to you. From inside their respective areas, the animals are mainly free to roam, so many will mooch right on up to you for a pat.

It looked like there were also water rides and rose gardens etc etc, which we didn't get around to, and didn't really try because we went coming into December and figured it would be a touch cold to bother.

If you have kids, make a day of it. If you don't, enjoy the ride and stop wherever you want. We had a blast here! (there's also a marine park across the road from this where most people who got off at the trainstop went.)",
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,A whole day's worth of fun in this wonderful park,"Using our JR Rail passes we decided ro make a day trip from Osaka to Fukuoka with our 3 children aged 6, 8 and 10. On the train we came across this park while searching for things to do. What a brilliant find! The train from Shin-Hakata was convenient and had some lovely seaside views. Once at the park we put our bags in a locker and hired bikes to get around. They were super cheap to hire and very comfortable. We visited the amusement park, which our children loved! So many things to do there and a food hall too. We then biked to the zoo, which had some interesting animals. The children had pony ride and loved cuddling the guinea pigs. We then took in the views of the ocean and golden sand beaches and made it back just in time to return our bikes. While we waited for our train arrived the children were able to walk a goat. They lady looking after it was very friendly and very kind to our children. We had a blast!! We would love to have been there in summer when the water park was open, but there was still plenty to see and do even in Autumn.","Written November 15, 2015"
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Wonderful and great park for kids and family,"When we arrived, we didn't realized that it is such a big park, we do not have enough time spending there, so we decided to skip the Zoo. Just walk around and play with the kids in the park would be great. Hubby and my son went to visit the Japanese car museum, although a bit small, but they said it worth a visit. The long donuts bought in the park is yummy even we had breakfast before coming.
The gardening there is nice, all the plants, lake are beautiful. The kids playground is superb (that was amazing and we had a great time there). We must pay a visit again when we go to Fukuoka next time.",

Overall, nice place to spend a relaxing day...

Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Excellent park and happy memories,"My young son and husband didn't expect this park would be so fun and enjoyable. It is a very large park and we did everything from feeding fish, jumping on big white trampoline type hills, roller type slides, difficult obstacle courses, swimming at the water park (except we found the water to be too cold), and the highlight of the visit was cycling as a family in safe bicycle routes. Everything was ready and accessible, my husband and I first rode on a two seater and then switched to a single riders with little station stops a long the way. We found this to be very fun and easy to ride since it is difficult for us to do this in Hong Kong.",
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Expansive Nature-Themed Park,"We took the Uminaka Ferry line to this expansive nature-themed park in Shikanoshima Island. Inside, suggest getting around it via bicycle rentals or moving trains (our choice). There are flower gardens, an amusement park, playgrounds, zoo, and vast grassy areas. We first went to the Animal Forest, where we saw capybaras, flamingos, small horses, kangaroos, llamas, various types of monkeys, peacocks (2 of them in different cages spread their colorful tails for us), prairie dogs, and other animals. The children petted guinea pigs and sheep. We next took the train to Wonder World, where we all rode go-karts on 2 separate tracks: flat and rough/unpaved. It was fun! The children then went on the giant Octopus slides, followed by the Whale Cloud “Fluff-Poline” (many connected trampolines), jumping up and down until park closing. We walked past a cherry-blossom-lined street towards the exit and took the JR line to Hakata Station, changing trains at Kashii Station.

Entrance fee is insignificant but the following attractions are mind boggling; 1. 3 of the longest downhill slides i hv ever seen, more than 50m downhill. 2. The waterpark is fantastic with aka ninja warrior obstacles for the kids built over a meandering stream. Sense of challenge, motor abilities and achievement 3. The go kart was a wild ride gteed to bring glee to many kids faces... 4. The giant bouncing castle at the entrance... This underrated and seldom publicised giant park exceeded our expectatiobs.

Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Fabulous flowers!,"My son lives in Fukuoka and we have visited Uminonakamichi Park several times, normally for the grandchildren to play. Each time I have visited, there is something new to look at; this April we saw the dolphin cloud ( a huge bouncy undulating area for the children to run, bounce and roll on) and while the children found the many play areas, my partner & I strolled around the flower garden. Wow! I had never been to this area before and was really impressed by the huge displays. We returned to the Park once more prior to leaving Japan and this time went to the animal area where again we were impressed at the space, cleanliness and care. The children were able to have hands-on experiences with the smaller creatures and thoroughly enjoyed their time. We did take picnics on each occasion, knowing there were plenty of seats and quiet areas to enjoy our food. Altogether two more great experiences during our time in Japan.",
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Normal park,"I visited Umi no nakamichi seaside park during Dec 2012. It was my first destination once my family and I reached Fukuoka.

Unfortunately, it was raining on the day i visited and the wind was extremely strong. Thus, we were not able to enjoy the park properly.

The park was very huge, however, there was not much things to see and do. Many of the attractions such as the go-cart were not open. Even the 'food court' does not seem to be open even thought it is already noon when I visited the place.

We finally found the ferris wheel after a long walk, however, the price seemed a little towards the high side and therefore we felt it wasn't worth the price. We did bought some food to feed the fish which we thought was quite fun!

It would be better to enjoy the park when the weather is not freezing cold!","Written January 4, 2013"

All of us - especially our 4 year old - had a great time, playing on the slides, jumping around on the inflatable mountains, looking at the boats out on the sea, and just generally walking around a spacious, green, quiet park.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Serenity in Yokohama,"A beautiful and peaceful garden just south of Yokohama. A little bit off the beaten track, so not as busy as other attractions, but it's well worth a visit. Easy walks around the lake, with magnificent views of the villas and pagoda.","Written March 8, 2020"
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Don’t go during winter season,"Our cruise was cancelled due to Convid-19 . Trying to fill our time, we decided to venture this garden. Because of the season, there was hardly anything to see. I went up to the pagoda area (pagoda itself was closed) to get a glimpse of the garden from above. Quite barren, but I’m sure it would have been a pretty sight to see in spring, summer and fall.
There was a house that one can enter (shoes off) and see how people live before. It was quite interesting.
Took a bus from Chinatown area and walked probably 15 minutes to the garden . Bus was a flat 220 yen , entrance fee to garden was 700 yen.","Written February 19, 2020"
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,always fun things here,we were lucky and saw a guitar concert live in one of the temples on the garden grounds...it's such a beautiful place and slightly off the beaten path in Yokohama. I imagine the fall foliage is also so pretty.,"Written February 9, 2020"
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,A garden break from the big city,"Tokyo certainly offers its share of beautiful gardens. Tourists know that. And Tokyo hosts a lot of tourists. The goal of serenity that underpins Japanese garden style can be achieved among a crush of visitors, possibly, if you close your eyes and play flute music through your earbuds.

Or you can take a short rail trip south of Tokyo to Yokohama. Not exactly a suburb, but almost. A half-hour train ride from Shinjuku station and you’ve escaped to the largest industrial port in Japan. Not serene. But you won’t be stopping at the port. You’ll be seeking out Sankeien Garden.

Yokohama also features the country’s greatest Chinatown, and you may want to have lunch there before catching the No. 8 or No. 148 bus to the garden $7/adult). Sankeien is so called because it was built by Hara Sankei, a rich silk merchant, and opened to the public in 1904. To add authentic touches Sankei-san pulled in vintage structures from elsewhere, such as the dominating pagoda, dating from the 1400s. Experience a tea ceremony, tour a gassho style (heavily thatched) house from Hida prefecture, or climb the hill to the pagoda. The garden brings together a little of traditional culture from around the Kanto region, a good introduction if you have no time to go very far beyond Tokyo.

Because, presumably, getting to Sankeien is slightly challenging, it seems to remain more tranquil than the more famous Tokyo gardens. We stopped by in January, perhaps not everyone’s top month for garden visits, but it was only a bit chilly, the pine is always green, something is always blooming, and the waterfowl still frolic.

Sankeien Garden is also a little melancholy. Its scars and ruins over a century call to mind the sad tragedy of Japan through war and natural catastrophe. Structures in the garden are gone or lie in ruins, victims of the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 or, more poignantly, allied bombing during World War II. This faint reminder of Japan’s heritage, a small island nation prone to earthquakes, tsunamis, and military dictatorships, perhaps can be sensed within the soft breeze through the pines and winter-blooming camellia. We can take time to pause and reflect. No earbuds necessary.",

The garden : After purchasing a ticket ( JPY 700 /adult ) at the counter , the ticket is scanned at the entrance and then one can choose to either take a leisurely walk around the garden or go along with an English speaking guide ( free of charge ) .
The landscaping of the garden with a big lake in the middle is mesmerizing. Since I visited during summer time , the garden was filled with lush green trees and small bridges leading to a few Japanese style houses which adds to the beauty of the place.

It was terrific to find free wheelchairs available at the entrance. It has gravel paths, which aren't the most conducive for wheelchairs, but the wheelchair was very helpful. The gardens were beautiful even if most of the plants weren't in bloom. We especially loved our tour of the farmer's house. It would have been great just to wander through on our own, but one of the men inside offered to show us around as a way to practice his English and to help us learn more.

It was nice. Depending on the time of year you can see different varieties of trees and plants flowering. For us it was blue and pink hydrangeas. The architecture was beautiful. Some very old buildings from 1600s and some from Edo period. I really enjoyed the house that you could walk in and see how a family lived a century ago.

We loved seeing the ladies in their kimonos having pictures made, and then we climbed up the hill to see the 3 tiered pagoda. All wonderful! The climb was short, but steep for a person with disabilities- but it was a beautiful sight! Definitely worth the bus ride if you are staying in Yokohama, and the entrance fee was about ¥700 per person.",
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Tip for a nice day out in the Yokohama area,"Beautiful park outside Yokohama. You do need to take the bus (number 8) to get to the park, or take a taxi. There are no train or subway stations nearby. The park shows some old japanese buildings and a three story pagoda moved here from Kyoto. The walkways are all gravel so good shoes are to recommend.
There are some ponds and small lakes ans well as some small brooks. Very nice on good days. Dont forget to bring a picknick basket.","Written March 31, 2019"

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Very Nice Way to Spend a Few Hours On A DIY,"We decided to revisit the Sankien Gardens plan on Tuesday morning since we missed them on Sunday. The gardens don’t open until 0900 and five of us (Pam, Sue, Judy, CL and myself) jumped in one of those great Toyota Alfard taxis right from Osanbashi Terminal. About 2500 YEN later, yes, 2500 YEN for the 5 of us. We were at Sankien Gardens. (Note that the Princess 2 hour tour was $70 per person.) The taxi was not $100 as told by the destination lecturer.

700YEN per person entry fee into the gardens was a bargain. We spent 3 hours wandering the gardens and the exhibits having CL translate the Kanji for us just for fun – almost everything had English translations as well, but having him translate the characters directly was pretty cool. The gardens were not crowded at all, but did have several wedding picture parties. The formal wedding kimonos were incredibly colorful, detailed and beautiful. The brides radiant and beautiful. The koi in the pond were a lot of fun to feed and watch. All of us were cheering on the turtles trying to get a piece of bread before the swarming koi got it. Unfortunately they were not successful. The koi invariably got all the bread.

Incredible pictures of an egret stalking and spearing an insect. Japanese and Chinese gardens, as explained by CL, are not botanical gardens exhibiting flowering plants. Rather they are islands of peace and serenity with everything strategically and deliberately placed to promote a unique view from every perspective. This was a private garden at one time and I can see how this would have been a unique and beautiful oasis for the family back in the day. There are refreshments (including beer) and toilets with the incredibly technologically advanced, AND CLEAN, stalls – including the electronic running water sound to encourage one to get the job done. All in all, a great and inexpensive way to spend a couple of hours in Yokohama.","Written November 24, 2018"
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Most Buildings are reserved for private ceremony,I went in October before cruise started in Yokohama. I was quite disappointed about most of the building are closed for only private use. The garden is well maintained but may be due to season there was no flowers at all. I trust there are quite a lot of history to see if those buildings are open for public. Wish the garden can publish what buildings to open in their website to let visitors to decide if they should go.,

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Go for a 1 hour free English guided tour! Very informative.,The garden is extremely beautiful in itself but we were lucky to encounter the free English guided tour (there was an announcement about the tour or ask the staff at the main entrance about the free guided tour.) The tour guide was very informative and provided us with insight why the garden was constructed and the Zen- Shinto infused landscape. He even imitated the process of the famous tea ceremony at the actual building where the owner of the compound did the ceremony 100 years ago. A free guided tour is well worth it. Go for it when there’s chance!!!,

A number of historic buildings from around Japan have been dismantled, transported to Sankeien Garden and rebuilt with exquisite attention to detail, so you would not be blamed for thinking you are in some other town and not Yokohama.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Relaxing weekend escape,"This place is like magic, it takes you back in time few hundred years in seconds where you start wondering who lived here and what they were doing at that time?; how did they pass there time? Were they happy? They had beautiful creations! Was it enough? Then you come back to the present and wonder about yourself; will you like to build something like this?
The man who first build this garden for himself was he thinking one day he will leave such a beautiful legacy?",
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Bucket List! This is a beautiful garden with something for everyone!,"This is by far the best garden we visited on the entire trip. Because of our love of oriental gardening, it has been on our Bucket List for years. It was great to see one that was so well designed, planned, populated, and maintained. It has wonderful plants, water features, historic architecture, beautiful vistas, changes in topography, viewing platforms, and serenity. It was a pleasure to spend a few hours here--there are photo opportunities at every turn and stop. I have included a few of my favorites.

Just as an aside, all ""true"" Japanese Gardens do not feature a lot of blooming plants. If you are looking a masses of color and annual plantings, do not make this trip! The beauty of the garden is the simplicity and the structure. There is a real elegance to it, but it is hard for many Americans to deal with it when compared to Western Gardens. You really have to find pleasure in the tree selection and training--the shapes are magnificent. The ponds tend to be very still (there are a few waterfalls and running ""rivers"" for you to enjoy for the sound, but not many). Just go in there prepared to relax and enjoy the natural beauty that has taken years to create!

There is an optional Tea Ceremony in one of the many buildings on the property. It is a very nice one that you should consider. There is also a decent gift shop at the entrance to the ceremony room.

The garden is very popular for wedding photos! There are a number of you g people in native dress having their pictures taken. It is really a beautiful sight--lots of color. For those of you wanting colorful plantings, this will more than make up for the lack of it in the garden!

It is important to point out that there is a lot of walking to be done here! We saw no one in the garden with walking aids of any kid. The main paths are smooth, but all the interesting side paths will be challenging to anyone with mobility problems.

Even if you are not an avid gardener, you should consider this if you have the time. We took the bus from the closest stop to the cruise terminal. The bus system (like so many things in Japan) is more than a bit confusing, but you can muscle through it. On the way back, you can stop at the Chinatown--which will bring you back to earth quickly!

The gardens (as well as the bus) will require Yen--no credit cards are accepted!",

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Beautiful even if no flowers are blooming,"Such a peaceful place to spend a couple hours, even if nothing is blooming (just a few hydrangeas and a lone day lily). It is not hard to get here: if you take the Nissan Gallery skywalk to Yokohama Station, you'll end up right at the YCAT bus terminal. Look for ""A Bus Line"" (red sign) and go to platform 2 and get in line. Wait for Bus 8 or 148 and have exact change ready (220 yen at this writing). Drop your coins in the box as you enter the front, and take a seat. The digital sign above the drive displays the next stop in English as well as Japanese, so when you see Sankei-en-Iriguchi stop about 35 minutes later, press the red button at your seat to indicate you intend to get off.

From where you are dropped, head toward the Claire bakery (stop in for a sweet treat-the pastries and cookies are good!), and then follow the signs 300m to the entrance. Lots of nice photo-worthy spots (again, nothing was blooming when I visited). Clean bathrooms inside and outside the entrance next to the parking lot. I spent about 60 minutes or so wandering around and enjoyed the serenity.

To return, just go back to the same bus stop and take the #8 or 148 bus back (again have exact coin change fare ready). You can get off anywhere along the line, so if you want to explore Chinatown, Motomachi or the Yamate Park western-style homes on the bluff, disembark before the Motomachi-Chukagai stop.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,One of My Favorite Places on Earth,"Nestled away in Yokohama this little garden is a gem. The garden is beautiful and well kept, very aesthetically pleasing. It also has little historic temples and old houses which are interesting in themselves. There is one multi-storey house you can walk around, complete with a fire in the open range kitchen, which is an interesting view into life into old Japan.

The tea ceremony was quite fun, with very friendly ladies explaining to us how we should do it and not being too distraught as we got it all wrong!

If doing a day trip to Yokohama it makes a good first stop. To get there we got the Tokyu line (catch it from Shibuya) and if you get the right train you can stay on it as it turns into Minatomirai line, then get off at the last stop, Motomachi-Chukagai. If you exit there (I want to say exit no.2 but don't quote me on that) you can cross the road to the bus stop - you can either hop on the bus no.8 which I understand stops nearby the garden (although we did not do this), or if you time it right there was an hourly bus that services the gardens and goes straight there. When heading back take the bus that goes every hour and get off near China town, just in time for lunch - perfect!","Written June 18, 2018"

We did manage to find one lovely tree in its last days so had to content ourselves with that.
The Gardens are beautifully laid out and like most tourist destinations in Japan, seniors do get a discount. Typical of the friendliness of the Japanese, we were greeted by a volunteer guide with quite good English who was only too happy to take us on a guided tour of the area, pointing out plants, etc and showing us through the amazing Samuri building which is some 700 years old. So well constructed!

On the day of our visit, luckily, there was an older gentleman who spoke English and offered to tour us around the house (for free!). It was amazingly preserved and impressively kept in good order. Definitely worth a visit. Also, don't forget to try the Shinagawa Soba Sampler in the restaurant closest to the entrance. I couldn't remember the name as it was in Japanese, like most establishments.

But the highlight for me is the Japanese tea ceremony in the memorial hall. For 500 yen, we were able to experience a tea ceremony with macha and sweets, and as a bonus they also thought us how to make traditional tea! It's the best 500 yen we've ever spent.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,A zen moment,"I went to this garden which was about a 35 minute bus ride + 5 minute walk from our hotel in MinatoMirai. I needed to find the soul of Yokohama and I think I found it here.
September was not a good time for viewing blossoms, it is probably enchanting in the spring when the cherry trees and wisterias are in bloom or in the fall when the maple trees turn from red to gold. But still I was not disappointed when I visited in September.
In this garden, you will find your zen moment if you wanted to, in the reflective pool with Koi swimming to the surface, the sighting of a heron perched on one foot or a wooden boat with ducks drying their wings.
Or have a tea ceremony with Japanese women who explain to you their art.
Or to watch a black butterfly move from one red lily to another in a dance.
Or witness a Japanese couple shyly walking together for photos of their wedding mementos.
But if none of these touch you, then go for the architecture- the pagodas and restored homes of an earlier period reflect the culture that is sorely lacking in metropolitan Yokohama.

It is amazing that an individual created this “collection” (with his enormous wealth!).","Written September 30, 2017"

The first thing you notice is a huge lake along one side is a forest walk and on the other lots of lotus flowers. They were all out in bloom the morning we were there, even our guide had never seen them this way before.
There were several temples within this large Japanese Garden, some of which had been relocated from elsewhere.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Beautiful Japanese gardens worth a visit,"I was staying in Yokohama and visited these gardens on a spur of the moment thing and I'm so happy I did! With a beautiful large lake, little bridges, mini waterfalls and Japanese building and view point this was a lovely afternoon. It was so peaceful and I took so many photos as it was stunning. If you want to escape the city and see more traditional Japanese gardens these are definately the best ones, even some of the more popular gardens in Tokyo did not compare to this place.
I found it very easy to get to, taking the 101 bus from Yokohama to Honmoku and then a short 3-5min walk to the entrance.",
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Large and Beautiful Garden,"After staying in Tokyo coming to this place was a surprise because of its huge size. The garden was bigger than I expected and could take hours trying to cover the entire grounds.

When my family went, there was a pictorial going on for a wedding couple. There were many backdrops for them to chose from.

Some of the sights we visited:

The carp lake
The ruins of a guest house for a monk
The observatory on top of the hill, overlooking the Yokohama Bay
An old Japanese house of a village chief
A small cottage
a small area used to serve sweets in the past
Tiny waterfall
Numerous small shrines
Pagoda

The grounds we covered only made up 60-70% of the entire estate. We had to end the trip early because of the July heat.","Written March 21, 2016"
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,A nice gentlemen docent.......,"I'm in Japan, from California, and my son wants to take me around Yokohama to see the sights. We went to the gardens one morning. It was interesting to see the different buildings that had been moved to the gardens. We took a nice long walk around the lake, which is the center point. Got a guide, printed in English, which helped, along with signs, explain what everything was. For me, the highlight was a docent, who took us through a farm house, built during the Edo Era, moved to the park in 1960. He explained everything, in Japanese, to my son, who relaid it to me. The docent seemed very pleased to show off his building, probably taking us into areas that were off limits to most. I hope I came away with a little more understanding of the culture and life in early 19th century, agricultural Japan.","Written March 17, 2016"
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Beauty and calm,"Getting there is a bit of a pain by public transport, simple enough, just slightly painful.
Train, then bus, then walk.

The walk makes up for the previous two. As I casually strolled to the gardens I had time to appreciate suburban Japan, with the streets in perfect conditions and everyone seeming to try and outdo each other with backyard semi-bonsai trees. Very relaxed when I got there.

Not very expensive, about 1000 Yen, I think (or less). And free to wander as much as I chose once inside the gate.

Come at the right time (late March/early April, I was told) and the plum blossoms are spectacular. Confirm this because they truly are captivating.

All the buildings and grounds are kept immaculate. I saw a couple of others taking photos there and most everyone was considerate of each other, standing out of the way and so on. A rare treat for sure.

Everywhere I went I was held in thrall by the magic of the place, walking around in this grandiose feeling almost palatial garden compound.

A guide I read suggested an hour and a half here as maximum time, I would suggest another hour on that if you truly want to relax and wander through slowly, appreciate the feeling and splendour that is here.

I left feeling zen and completely at ease. Seeing all the cats wandering around didn't hurt either. All very relaxed and comfortable with strangers everywhere.

Enjoy the views, breathe the air, have a cup of tea at the teahouse.",

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Still beautiful even in snowless winter,"You need to buy the entry ticket at one of the machines nearby. It's a hassle given the all-Japanese characters on the machine, but the parking attendant was glad to help.
It's still beautiful even with many leaf-less trees, you can imagine the beauty in a glorious spring. There are many spots that's suitable for great photos, some with the three-storied pagoda as part of the background. Climbing up the hill to the pagoda was a different story; it looked steep and the pagoda itself was not that stunning, so I decided to pass the opportunity.
If you look at individual items (like the pagoda I mentioned above), Sankeien garden was not particularly interesting; they look old, even a bit ugly.However, as a whole, the garden was exquisite.
There were some temporary tents that were probably used to sell things in the garden (the tents were empty when I was there, perhaps because it's late in the afternoon). Those tents were an eyesore, quite unfortunate for such a beautiful garden.",

They took us up hills, down to the lake, along small rivers and over the bridges! This place has rich history of both human and natures that will fascinatingly inspire you. Not to miss taking lots photos of beautiful gardens, amazing heritage buildings and the over 100 years old tree!

Wearing good pair of walking shoes is a must to truly enjoy this garden! For totally comfort you may also need to apply some mosquito repellants for the late afternoon tour, we didn't have any and had to suffer with some bites!

We took the same bus back to Yokohama station, but before that we got off at the 'revival' Yokohama China town for some Chinese food/snacks tasting adventures which included the Yokohama Number One dumplings and the Giant Chinese bun! There are plenty of nice restaurants, that you may want to try and enjoy your night here.",

Especially striking in the fall, Sankeien opens selected evenings for harvest moon viewing-- and sometimes sponsors delightful open air concerts. However, Sankeien's beautiful gardens and historic buildings (some of which are designated national treasures) are beautiful throughout the year, with each season bringing its own special natural treats. Be sure wear your walking shoes and to bring a camera as the various settings provide multiple photo opportunities. Plan to spend at least a couple of hours if you plan to cover most of the garden. In the tranquil environment, it is not unusual to see kimono-clad couples posing for wedding pictures. Traditional snacks or refreshments are available at a several locations. In a shop adjacent to the on-site museum which highlights the history of the garden's founder, an early silk merchant and an important patron of traditional arts, kimono-clad women serve green tea prepared in the traditional style. While the garden is a little out of the way (it is accessible by bus from central Yokohama), it is a great way to escape the concrete of the city and enjoy the feel of an older and more aesthetic Japan. If you don't have the time to visit Kyoto or Nara and still want to enjoy the charm of a traditional garden and setting, Sankeien is a great choice.",

The walk from the bus stop to the entrance was very inviting with the trees in full bloom showing us the way to the gardens. It was a lovely brisk day and there were plenty of people heading towards the entrance. We had bought some sushi at the railway station before we left so we could experience a real Hanami outing. We walked all around the gardens and even climbed up to the Pagoda and the lookout. The gardens were very beautiful with all the cherry blossoms out in bloom. There are a few eating places selling great looking foods in case you dont bring your own and you can sit at the outside tables and chairs that they supply admiring the scenery at the same time. There were a lot of brides having photos taken in this beautiful setting, so if you happen to visit when the cherry blossoms are in bloom you will be amazed at the beautiful dresses these ladies are wearing. It is a great time to visit. Also just outside the entrance there is a small stall selling local foods and we just had to try their own homemade cherry blossom icecream even though it was quite a cool day. The owner is very happy to have you sit while you are eating and even gave us a warm drink after. He would not take any money for the drink.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,IT IS A MUST,We were in Yokohama for a Congress and the Tourism Office of Yokohama highly recommended us to visit this Japanese typical park. We did it and we were not disappointed at all. This is something like doing a visit of Japan and having the opportunity to see in the same time the old and the new Japan. The parks contain 14 different areas (themes). this is easy to make the visit. The prize entrance is cheap. And the park is well served by public transportation. The park is totaly wheelchair accessible. We highly recommend the visit of the park to all visitors of the city of Yokohama. It is a must.,"Written June 3, 2015"
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,"This is not a Garden, but a Collection of Buildings from Various Eras","This large facility is less of a garden and more of a collection of buildings from various periods in Japanese history. A wealthy businessman purchased these buildings form various parts of Japan and had them erected at this site outside of Yokohama. In addition, he built a residence for himself in 1920. Later a modern building was constructed to house some pieces of art and to display a tribute to the wealthy silk merchant, Sankei Hara. Not shying from immodesty, he called this facility ""Sankei-en"" (meaning Sankei's garden), later passing away in 1939.

You can go into one of the Edo period buildings (the old Yonohara house moved to Sankei-en from Gifu Prefecture), a wealthy farmer's house, and see artifacts from that period. This is very interesting. Unfortunately, none of the other buildings are accessible, and can only be seen from a distance. There is an observatory (viewing platform) up on a hill in the very back of the garden, but the sweeping view is made up of oil refineries, tank farms, industrial installations, and a massive freeway. You must watch your step because the paths and stairways are not in good repair. Also up on the hill is a three tiered pagoda from the Muromachi period (what does this have to do with the garden?).

There were various shrines scattered around the facility, but they didn't make much sense and did not add to the beauty of the place. On the other hand, there was an attractive wisteria arbor and many nicely constructed period bridges.

I feel uncomfortable calling this facility a ""garden"", because that would insult the many beautiful gardens throughout Japan. It wasn't until long after Sankei Hara died that any pines were added, and to this day there are virtually no stones (the most important feature of any Japanese garden) on display. The quality of the gardening and pruning is either absent or clunky. Much was overgrown, and there were weeds everywhere. The pruning of the pines was mediocre, and what they do to the plum trees is just plain weird. The ponds are murky, stagnant water. Overall, the facility is unattractive.

In the modern building (offices and art displays), ladies in kimonos were inviting visitors to partake of the tea ceremony, which was a nice experience. There is a small restaurant in the back where we enjoyed beer, tempura, and green tea ice cream.

In summary, if you are interested architecture you should visit Sankei-en. If you are interested in Japanese gardens, you need not bother coming here. From Shibui and wabi-sabi, not a trace. This is a shocking story of a rich man's search for his cultural roots that somehow become lost in the rise and clamber of the middle class during the Edo period. Sadly, he failed.",

My only disappointment is that the grounds and around the pagodas are not well groomed or maintained. I asked my guide and she explained that the gardens do not raise much money to maintain and a lot of the upkeep is volunteer. I think more people should visit the grounds and help contribute.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,My most favourite garden in Japan,"I absolutely loved the Sankei-en garden. I went on one beautiful Monday morning in May, paid 500 yen and was mesmerised... There was hardly anyone there. It was so peaceful with no crowds. The garden is very large with lots of old houses that were transferred here from Kyoto and Kamakura. But everything feels so natural as if the houses have been here ever since. There was not many flowers in bloom but it was amazing to just walk around, take pictures and listen to the sound of water and heaps of bird noises. There were lots of signs in English, so you could learn more about the houses and history of the park.
The former Yonoharake house is open to the public, so you can wander through and see how people lived some years ago. It has a very wide collection historical objects and to me it felt even more authentic than the houses in Shirakawa-go! There are also super nice and knowledgeable volunteers that are always happy to help and answer your questions.
I visited many gardens during my trip around Japan - in Kyoto, Nara, Kanazawa... and this one was definitely my most favourite one!
It is a little bit out of town centre so with the transportation plan at least 3 hours or half a day to spend there.",

We entered the tea room in the reception building and sat down on the vacant seats. We were offered tea with 2 sugary little cakes. An explanation was given while the tea was being prepared. The tea was a strong green concoction. I haven't tasted it before in my life. It was a short yet fulfilling experience.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,"Not, Ebisu Gardens, But the Real Deal","Visiting the Yokohama City area and want a bit of tranquility and tradition, then you should visit the Sankeien Gardens. Recently, visitors wanted to see Japanese Gardens,and were directed to see Ebisu Gardens in Tokyo. Much to their disappointment, these are not gardens at all in the traditional sense but a huge shopping mall-like venue. So I took them to Sankeien, and they were amazed by the immediate transformation from modern city life, to the traditional, tranquil garden sights along with the beauty of the architecture that is trademark Sankeien.
There are ponds strategically placed and old wooden bridges with lotus blossoms peaking thru, while the carp in the ponds await your morsels of bread. . The bread is to be purchased at the nearby vendor and you can enjoy the pleasure of feeding the carp around the many ponds. The experience can be satisfying for children and adults alike.
The architecture and the landscaping are simply fantastic, and you will marvel at nearly every step you take, and will want to photograph it to keep as one of your treasured memories of your visit.
You can also take a rest while walking the gardens, as there are many benches provided and you can buy some light foods as well. There is also the opportunity to brown-bag or 'bento' your lunch as well. There are places to sit and have a nice lunch. Depending to the time of year, it can be a quiet, private time, or it can be a crowded and some of the tranquility is lost.
I've visited twice last year, and both were during the cold weather season, so not to crowded and very peaceful.
Another really great thing about it, is that you can call ahead and get the schedule for the tea ceremonies that are held inside the small museum area. The ladies are wear the traditional Japanese kimono and will demonstrate how tea is prepared. After preparing the tea, they serve you and explain how the tea should the receiver should drink the tea. It's a great experience for everyone. You can take great photos with the ladies sitting dressed in kimono in front of the tea making area (not sure what it's called).
The only thing that can be annoying sometimes is if it's crowded and then the experience is not as pleasant, but still a winner. You can always 'escape' the heavily populated areas as the gardens are so vast, that if you keep walking around, you can find a tranquil place and reflect. There is an entrance fee, and a bit on the pricey side, but there is a discount for the over seventy persons, with proper identification.
Depending on the season, there are different events being held at any given time, for example, fire fly night sessions, when specific flowers are in bloom, they sometimes have night events. So best to call ahead or check the net about what's going on. Enjoy!","Written February 17, 2015"

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Hidden gem in Industrial Yokohama,"Sankeien Gardens is a slice of tranquillity located in the hustle and bustle of Yokohama.
These gardens and buildings are beautifully laid out with amazing scenery that gives you a great taste of Japanese culture landscaping and architecture.
An amazing view of the surrounding harbour and on clear days, Mount Fuji, is available from the lookout located near the 3-story pagoda.
Several small cafes/kiosks are located throughout the gardens selling a range of traditional snacks, ice-creams, cold and warm drinks.
Guided tours are available at different times although I was lucky enough to find a volunteer helper who was very keen to develop his English skills and happily guided me around the gardens explaining all of the details of the buildings, vegetation and general layout of the gardens. An English map is also available when you purchase your entry ticket to the garden.
My method of access to the gardens from Yokohama was via the train system on the Negishi Line to Yamate station. From here it is a quick 10 minute taxi ride to the gardens.
Taxi routinely service the entry to the gardens so access back to the train for return to Yokohama station is simple and convenient.

Between us it only cost about $2.50 each ($10 Aust Total) and was very Convinent. Distance about 5KM.
As with most gardens in Japan there is an entrance fee but it is quite reasonable 500 Yen for Adults. We spent several hours exploring and enjoying the gardens which also contain 17 Historical Buildings that have been transported from other areas of japan and rebuilt within the Gardens. Unfortunatley only ONE is open for the Public to explore inside but the others are interesting from the outside.
The Gardens also have an Observatory and a 3 Storey Pagoda. A Main Pond and several other water features. All up I would say, Beautiful, Interesting and well worth Visiting. Allow about 3 Hours to enjoy properly.","Written September 26, 2014"

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,An oasis in the concrete jungle,"Sankeien was originally the home and very spacious garden of a wealthy silk merchant. He bought a number of beautiful old buildings and had them brought to Yokohama, placed in the gardens and restored. There are temple buildings (including a pagoda), tea houses, a large farmhouse, a bridge, a lake, etc.

I have been to Sankeien many times over the years and never get tired of it. I recommend visiting on a weekday as early in the morning as possible, when there are fewer people, or later in the afternoon. It tends to get crowded on weekends. You can get there by bus or taxi from Negishi Station, on the JR Keihin Tohoku Negishi Line, which runs through Yokohama Station. Make sure you have a good look around the Inner Garden, which contains the best buildings, some of which are hidden amongst the trees.

The best time of year? Any season other than winter, when most of the trees have lost their leaves, the grass is brown and the garden is generally drab, unless you are lucky enough to visit after a rare fall of snow.","Written August 7, 2014"

The grounds are beautiful and the sculptures are nicely spaced and arranged. The pond has a small network of little paths coming off it which take you to various hidden gems. Bring 10 or 100¥ coins to feed the enormous koi! There are bathrooms in several different places through the grounds (by the two children's attractions and the gift shops) and the paths are wide enough to accommodate the traffic. My kids did ok with the scavenger hunt in the Picasso hall (otherwise would have suffered greatly) but they loved playing in the tree of nets but start there, it's gets crowded by 10-11 o'clock. We enjoyed the foot onsen, a nice break from the sculptures and art exhibits. Do this after the stairs up the tower--dont skip the tower, it may look unimpressive outside but it's amazing inside!
The water was very comfortable and the seating easily accomodates social distancing (but not wheelchair accessible). We got a beer and some baked gods from the restaurant and it's expensive compared to the states and I've had better food from other food counters at attraction in Japan but the lemongrass beer was good and the muffin vanished even though it was a big dry.
Not all spaces are stroller or wheelchair friendly (the tower, the pond, and the star garden) but the indoor exhibits all have access for mobility challenged.

Japan,The Hakone Open-Air Museum,Wish we had planned ahead,"We went into town to see the Hakone Museum of Art because of our interest in ceramics. We had some time after lunch and decided to walk over to the Open Air Museum (without having really researched it). We were blown away. Beautiful setting, well curated pieces. The two hours we had left were not enough to really appreciate everything. And this was on a cold, drizzling day. Can't imagine how nice it must be when the sun is out.","Written January 7, 2020"
Japan,The Hakone Open-Air Museum,Finish with a hot springs foot bath!,"Two hours was barely long enough for this amazing place, especially with two children who didn’t want to leave each of the Kid Art attractions! The museum was really an art gallery, with sculptures scattered around the beautifully kept grounds, with the bonus of a Picasso exhibition building. Even though the weather was a little drizzly, it was still a pleasure to wander the exhibits. For the kids, there were underground stairs, a spider web of ropes, a climbing box, though the maze was closed. On the way to the exit was a chance for the kids (and adults) to be ‘living sculptures’ with three further activities. Even the gift shop was well stocked with a wide variety of items. This attraction doesn’t seem to have the publicity it deserves! It’s a ten minute walk from the Hakone railway station.","Written January 7, 2020"

Who knew! Don't miss it if you are in the area. PLan to spend at least a morning or an afternoon. It'll be a highlight of your trip.",
Japan,The Hakone Open-Air Museum,Unexpectedly rich in sculpture and art,"We didn't realize Hakone is a bit of an art focused region, and the Hakone Open-Air Museum should really be considered one of the finest sculpture gardens in the world, with a hundred or so Picassos thrown into the bargain. This is worth every yen and two to three hours of your time.","Written January 4, 2020"

I just loved it from the moment I entered with the beautiful lawns surrounded by mountains as an extraordinary backdrop to the most fabulous sculptures from the likes of Rodin and Moore and Japanese sculptors. There is a Picasso gallery if you are into Picasso which I thought was alittle underwhelming. The museum shop was a little gem with some interesting giftlines. There is a bit of walking to take in all the park and some great kid spaces . You need a minimum of 2 hours to do this place justice and a bit more time would be beneficial.,

The restaurant area had s buffet and an alacarte, neither looked that appealing.

Japan,The Hakone Open-Air Museum,Enjoyable couple of hours,"We were lucky to be there on a dry day, I wouldn't recommend visiting on a very wet day because almost all of the sculptures are outside. I thought the range was very impressive and include several Henry Moore's & and at least one Hepworth (so the British were well represented). I must be the only person who wasn't very keen on the Picasso gallery, it just seemed to be a collection of unimportant pieces. The gardens were lovely but needed a bit of work (especially weeding).
We enjoyed the buffet lunch in the restaurant - basically eat as much as you wish from a very substantial number of options including serve yourself ice cream for a reasonable price.It's possible to get there using the Hakone Tozan Train so you could take the opportunity to both ride the switchback train and visit the museum.","Written November 6, 2019"

The setting for all this art is in a well manicured outdoor setting designed to show each art work in its best possible setting. Some pieces are displayed in water, others on the open lawn and others in alcoves or on the hill. This sculpture garden looks like a Disney theme park.

In addition to the sculpture there are several installations designed for young kids to play on. There is also a 300 piece Picasso collection of ceramics that has its own pavilion among the outdoor installations.

Japan,The Hakone Open-Air Museum,A real highlight in Hakone,"We went to this ‘museum’ just as it opened (9am) on a Wednesday morning. It was pretty warm but cloudy. We couldn’t believe what a high quality gallery/museum this is. The sculptures are nearly all outdoors, so maybe if it’s scorching hot or wet or cold it might not be as good, however when we went it was perfect. Also, we felt that we had the place almost to ourselves for the first 30 mins, which was really special!

The garden/landscaping is superb and as you go around you discover new delights around every corner. I know this sounds cheesy but it’s true. I’m no sculpture buff but I found plenty of interesting and exciting pieces.

Coffee at the lovely air-conditioned cafe was top notch. It’s also worth noting that the museum has luggage lockers out front for a deposit of 100 yen. We went on our last day in Hakone and we stashed our luggage here, saw the museum and then had lunch before collecting our bags. We spent 2.5 hours looking round.

While most travelers come to Hakone for the beautiful scenery, boat ride and osens, this open air museum is worth visiting, whether you are an art lover or not, as it is set in the midst of the beauty of Hakone’s natural surroundings with lush green mountains, valleys, trees and forests as it’s back drop. On a clear day, the entire environment is breath taking. Definitely worth a stop as you make your way round the Hakone loop. Most of the amazing art pieces were displayed outdoors, some of them were pretty huge and gigantic but they were also carefully placed in view of the natural surroundings and they were well spread out with lots of open space in between exhibits. There were also indoor exhibits such as a whole building dedicated to the works of Picasso.

Human descriptions do not do justice to the majestic display of art and nature here. One has to be physically there to experience its grandeur.",

The museum had a small gift shop. There was also Key Coffee which is small beverage and snack shop in the museum.

Best of all, the museum is free and parking is free.

One thing to note is that almost all of the exhibits had explanations in Japanese only. A few had english translations, so you have to really like aviation if you come to this museum and can't read Japanese.

Near the end, I saw a sign saying where to return your audio guide. But I never saw an area where you could get one. If you come here you may need to ask the staff where to get it.

The exhibitions are great to see. Weapons such as missiles are displayed together with reasonable explanations. You can get into the cockpits of exhibited airplanes which had flied in the air before. This may bring you the memorial photos.

Japan,Hamamatsu Air Park,"Several aircraft, weapons, simulator, and dress up as a pilot","The air park is free. It is amazing with kids, but also good fun as an adult.
Lots of interesting things to see: There is a variety of fighter jets, search and rescue and training plains exhibited. You can dress up as a pilot and takes photos.
There is a great simulator where you can practice take off, fight, and landing. For this you have to book a slot because it takes about 10 minutes and it is extremely popular. Best tactic is to go there, book your slot, explore the hangar, and then go there on time.
There are lots of additional displays and info on the work of the Defense Forces: rescue and peacekeeping operations overviews, what the role of the defense forces is, how the different kinds of aircraft support each other and ground forces, etc.
Many interesting weapons systems, radar systems, and other cool equipment can be viewed too.
There is also a simplified simulator for kids. Both are fun.
Most info is in Japanese, so having an audio guide or a good translation app (like the instant translator of google) is very practical.
Photography is allowed everywhere.
It is next to a real air base so you can sometimes see the current jets and helicopters coming and going, the staff training.
Getting there: you can do it by bus or cab. Former takes longer but is cheap, latter is quick but costs a bit more.
There is a cafe and restaurant, plus a gift shop packed with cute items and nice models for those who love aircraft.
Great fun, we had a lovely time there!","Written May 2, 2018"
Japan,Hamamatsu Air Park,Slightly disappointing,"Don't be put off by other people's comments - this place can easily be reached by public bus for a fare of around 500 yen each way on bus number 51. The bus trip takes about 20 minutes, and then you just walk 50m to the first corner, turn left, walk for about 15 minutes on this street until it ends in a T intersection and then you will see the Air Park right in front of you. The entrance is about 200m to the left when you come to the T intersection. The very helpful staff at the Hammamatsu tourist info will tell you all about it if you drop in. That's located in the JR Railway station.
The park itself was a bit disappointing for me. We went first to the museum part and only then did we find the display hangar (which was much better). All the simulator rides were booked out by 10am, so really it was a long trip for not much. My husband is an aircraft nerd, and he enjoyed it. I personally thought the Shinkansen museum in Nagoya was better.","Written March 5, 2018"

Japan,Hamamatsu Air Park,Fighter jets everywhere.,"The Hamamatsu airpark located north-west of Hamamatsu city is part of the Japan Self Defence Force facility. It is an active air force base so you will see jet trainers and helicopters in action while you visit this museum. The museum is located in an old hanger but has been modernised with static displays, models, videos, posters in one part of the building. When you walk into another part of the building, you will see an amazing collection of jet fighters from the Vampire, the Sabre, the Starfighter as well as Japan's own design jet fighters and many more aircraft including helicopters. This hall is absolutely amazing by the scope of the display and the fact that you can jump into a cockpit and pretend you are in Topgun. There is a fighter simulator which is fun with a closing canopy and controls like in a fighter but really simplified. The museum portion is over three levels with the third floor containing a cafe, library and more displays, At the ground floor entry is located a gift shop. The great thing about this attraction is that it is free however a cab ride is essential to get there. The price of a cab ride to and from Hamamatsu station should be between 2000 and 3000 yen. Finding a cab near the airpark is hard. Walk due east from the main gate to the airpark and you will come across a small shopping mall and there is a cab rank. Worth visiting if you love planes and aviation.","Written June 15, 2017"

Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,A lovely and calm trip out away from hustle and bustle! Lovely place.,Went here for a trip to get away from the city hustle and bustle. A very calm and peaceful place. When you get off the train at weekends there is a free shuttle service bus waiting for you that takes you to the door. And back again afterwards. So organised!! You pay for the tour and get an English speaking headset provided. You are taken round various parts of the site and it's all very interesting. They have a tasting session and a gift shop which was also brilliant. Warning - you won't get this at the Tokyo airports when you leave and they are too big for hand luggage - more than 100ml allowance so either buy small ones or put it in your case at high risk of breakage. I can tell you I have bought a bottle of Nikka Whisky in the UK since being back so don't worry about it. Great day out. Great experience.,"Written November 3, 2019"
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,Go if you like whiskey.,"I understand how people are up and down about the factory tour. It's 40+ minutes on the train from Sendai and then if you're not there during the weekend you have another 30-40 minutes walking to get into the hall. I did it on a day where it was probably 33°C and I'd already gone to see Yamadera. The humidity in the area is oppressive, and one of the Japanese tourists told me the area was picked in part for the humidity and how it would help create a great whiskey.

Japanese tours can be a little cold. You have to look at things through windows and a lot of what goes on in a distillery is just looking at pipes and tanks. You don't even get to see the Coffey still, though they will point out the building. I've heard that the VIP tour gets to see a barrel being charred, but you have to be a VIP in the minds of Nikka Whiskey, not in your own mind.

The best part is after the tour. There's a small bar where you can get short pours of Nikka for very little money. Where else can you even find Taketsuru 12, 17, and 21 and when I went the short pour of 21 was only ¥500! There was even a special edition Taketsuru that was ¥7,000 for a very short pour and I was glad I tried it.

I'd recommend finding a non-driving way to get there so you can taste a little of everything. During the tour they tell you there's three types of Yoichi that they blend to make the single malt (it's my understanding that they sort the barrels into different flavor categories) and I had a taste of the Peaty and Salty was worth tasting on its own.

Just remember, it might seem long way to go but just going from Osaka to Kyoto is going to take you longer and to me those cities are right next to each other.",
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,How to get there on a weekday with minimal walking,"I thought I would drop this line to anyone thinking of going to the Nikki factory near Sendai. I found lots of partial information before we went but nothing as specific as I would have liked. I use a walking stick so some of the options were not open to me (such as the 2.4 kilometre walk from Sakunami station).

So, if you want to get there with less walking, on a weekday (e.g., no shuttle bus) here is what to do

From Sendai Station, wait at bus stop number ten and take bus number 840 toward Sakunami Onsen. At the time of writing, the buses went at half past the hour (e.g, 11:30, 12:30 etc.). The bus trip is long (about an hour) and not that interesting, so you could take something to read.

Once on the bus you can read the screen at the front and keep an eye on station names, the Nikka factory stop does have a name and also an English advice message that this is where you get off for the NIkka factory. This is all good news because otherwise you look like you are getting off in the middle of nowhere. However there is a sign toward the NIkka factory, I just didn’t see it until I got off the bus. Follow that sign down the road and you can’t miss it, although even the walk into the factory is quite long for someone with a minor disability.

Once you get the to factory they have a list of all the train departure times from Sakunami (that is presuming you aren’t there on a weekend in which case there is the shuttle bus). Nothing I read online indicated the availability of taxis in the area, however they ARE available once you get there and the lady at the Nikka desk booked a taxi for us, even timing it to arrive at an appropriate time for the end of the tour plus shopping but in plenty of time to get to Sakanumi train station to catch the train back.

So that all worked perfectly for us. I won’t say more about the factory and tour, others have said it all. It was a nice day out and even more so as it was cherry blossom season and the place is quite beautiful at that time. Good luck in your whisky adventures.",
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,average visit experience and it takes over one hour to get there,"I only gave three points, because ... it is time consuming to get there and it only interesting for whisky buffs. And even then it is only an average destillery ... Let me explain.

Getting there: The destillery can be reached by bus. The bus is starting at JR Sendai station. There is only one bus per hour and the bus takes over one hour itself. From the bus stop it takes another 10-15 minutes walk. There is also a train. But the closest train station (Sakunami) is 2,5km away from the destillery. --> Visiting the destillery really takes half a day.

The destillery: The history of Whisky in Japan startet with Suntory and Nikka. Miyagikyo is the second big destillery of Nikka after the main destillery in Yoichi. For that reason alone the destillery is a point of interest for everyone who is interested in japanese whisky.

The destillery provides a guided tour that does not require a reservation in advance. Big bonus point. After the tour you can sample 2 whisky free. For any additional dram you have to pay. They have a wide amout of Nikka whisky you can chose from. You can sample 21 year old whisky without the need to buy the whole expensive bottle or you can sample a whisky that you will not find in a bar or a store outside Japan. The price for a dram is really fair. Specially if you consider the prices of whisky in a japanese bar. The tasting is a big selling point to visit the destillery. And you can also by some ""Destillery Edition"" whisky that you only can purchase here at the destillery and nowhere elsse. Big point.

And now the reasons why I only give three points:
(1) The time to get there and getting back to Sendai. It really takes half a day. The visitor center closes at 4:30pm. So you need to take a bus before 1pm to have enough time for the guided tour (1h) and some tasting (at least 1h) and get back to the bus stop in time.
(2) The first impression of the distillery is not that remarkable. It looks like a factory. This is killing the mood a little bit.
(3) The tour is quite ok but it is a standard tour that you can get in every destillery. You do not visit the Malting area and the mash tuns are behind glass.
(4) Miyagikyo is the origin of the ""Coffey Malt"" and the ""Coffey Grain"". But the tour does not cover the coffey still itself from that these whisky are coming from. The show a picture in the advertisement video bu that's it. This, in my opinion, is a big letdown! The Coffey Whisky is (for me) the major thing that seperates Miyagikyo from the rest. -- Even if the coffey still looks like something that belongs into a chemical lab or a oil raffinery. If own both coffey whisky and a really hoped to see there origin.",
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,Nikka fun outside Sendai,We visited the Nikka factory following our visit to the nearby Akio Onsen. Our daughter in law loves whiskey and as a native of Japan has wanted to visit this iconic factory known for its history of bringing Scottish whiskey making to Japan. The area is stunning with nearby waterfalls and woods. The factory is nestled in the green woods and serves up a great history lesson on the process of making fine whiskey. I have done similar tours in Rum factories in Jamaica and they are fascinating. You can also do a whiskey tasting after the tour as well.

Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,Great day out and tasting,"The tour is in Japanese but they will provide a recording in English to follow along. The highlight of the tour of course is the tastings! Shuttle from Sakunami station and 3 generous glasses of high quality Nikka Whisky are provided (along with non alcoholic refreshments) free of charge. I highly recommend the tour. The paid samplers of aged whisky (including the award winning 17yr Takesuru blend) and the gift shop is reasonably priced.

Of course, as you'll be tasting alcoholic drinks the best way to travel is by train rather than bringing a sober driver. The JR line is convenient to Kita Sendai and Sendai stations but does not run very often (especially late in evenings or on Sundays or holidays). I do not recommend taking the last tour in the day as there will be a long wait at Sakunami station to return to the city.","Written October 3, 2017"

My favourite part was the funny little lanyard they give to the 'designated driver' to make sure they don't get served alcohol.","Written May 24, 2017"
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,Nice distillery tour,"Not to easy to get to from Sendai, but a train ride and good walk will be worth it for the whisky fan.

Tour is free, only in Japanse, but there is an English spoken device available.

There is also a shop with a load of distillery only bottles. Tasting bar is available as well (at a fee), in the tour a couple of drams are included as well.

You can take photo's everywhere, but no filming inside the facility.","Written April 15, 2017"
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,"Beautiful Setting, Average Tour","Nikka Miyagikyo Distillery

Access:
We drove to the distillery from Utsunomiya after a brief stop in Yamagata. Parking was easy and access to the main tour building was very convenient.

Tour Experience:
During our visit, the tour was only offered in Japanese, which was expected based on a quick phone call to distillery staff. There is no charge for the tour, which is very nice.

If you are someone who frequently visits other distilleries, you might find the tour lacking in detail and in the allowed proximity to the production processes. One of my favorite whiskies from Nikka is produced using their Coffey still. Tour members are not allowed to enter the building with the Coffey still, so that was somewhat disappointing. The giant pot stills are amazing to see in person. Tour participants finish their experience in the gift shop and tasting room. Some small samples of Nikka whiskies are offered to each tour participant.

Overall:
I would recommend visiting the Miyagikyo distillery, if you are already in the area. Even though I am an avid whisk(e)y lover, I did not find the experience worthy of making a special trip. In my personal opinion, the whole tour felt rather detached and cold. I think Nikka could learn a lot by benchmarking some of the Scottish or American Bourbon distillery tour experiences.","Written February 7, 2017"

Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,It's a good experience.,It help me understand Japanese whisky. But it's not easy to get there. I drove a rent car. It took 45 minutes from the Sendai station.,
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,Best Part Was the Sample Tasting at the end,"I believe going to a whiskey distillery is a good distraction. Alcohol is made pretty much the same way whether you're making beer or whiskey. Our tour was in Japanese (I was with Japanese people btw) so I didn't really learn anything new or interesting that I hadn't seen on a History Channel ""Modern Marvels"" re-run. The best part of the tour was being able to sample 3 different products at the end of the tour and I found a nice, smooth whiskey I liked. However, I couldn't even find that whiskey in Japan, not even in Sendai later on the day.","Written June 13, 2016"
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,nice free tour,"To book a tour for English, you have to call or fax. We just dropped in. If there're a big tour, you might not get in the tour.

From Sendai JR Station, you take a train, but some trains don't go all the way to JR Sakunami Station, so check the time table for the train before you go. Otherwise, you'll end up waiting for the connecting train for an hour like us. For weekdays, there're free shuttle from JR Sakunami Station to the distillery. You can also take a local bus, but you have to walk about 10min from the bus stop to the distillery. If you want to walk from JR Sakunami Station to the distillery, it'd take 20min.

The tour is basically in Japanese only. For English speakers, you need to get a recorded tour and play at each station for English explanation. All displays are Japanese. When we visited on mid-April weekend, as we're the only participants, we're in a private tour.

The biggest fun is free tasting at the end. We're provided 2 kinds of whiskies and an apple wine. They also offer tonic to mix with whiskey and cold tea/soda for free. If you want to try high quality whiskies, you can taste for a pay at the bar. At the shop, you can also purchase different kinds of whiskies. Whiskies at Narita Duty-Frees sell only premium Nikka whiskies only (think $500 a bottle). Super Nikka isn't available at Narita Duty-Frees.","Written May 24, 2016"

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,The most gorgeous shrine among the temples and shrines in Nikko,"世界遺産に登録されている日光の社寺の中で、恐らく最も参拝客の多い神社と言えよう。
他の社寺と比較して、境内にある建築物の配色は色鮮やかで、梁や柱などに施された緻密な彫刻には目を見張るものがある。『絢爛豪華』とはまさにこの神社を指すのだろう。境内そのものが彫刻作品の屋外ギャラリーと言っても過言ではない。その分、写真撮影のために立ち止まる観光客も多く、特に土日祝日の日中の混雑ぶりは敬遠したくなる。建物の彫刻は勿論、建物内の絵画（鳴き龍や狩野探幽筆の麒麟等）も素晴らしく、数百年経過した今でもはっきりと鑑賞することが出来る（御本社や薬師堂等の建物内は撮影禁止）。
境内の各建物間の移動は基本的に階段であるため、車椅子等の障碍を持つ方等にとっては利用しづらいかもしれない。境内にはコインロッカー等は無いため、大きな荷物はホテルもしくは駐車した車内に置く必要がある。

Of all the shrines and temples in Nikko that are registered as World Heritage sites, it's probably the most visited shrine.
Compared to other shrines and temples, the color scheme of the buildings in the precincts is more vivid, and the intricate carvings on the beams and pillars are remarkable. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the precinct itself is an open-air gallery of carvings. However, they are the cause of many tourists stopping to take pictures, and the crowds during the day, especially on weekends and holidays, make you feel to avoid to visit there.
In addition to the carvings on the buildings, the paintings inside the buildings (such as Naki-Ryu (Singing dragon), and a Qilin by Kano Tanyu) are wonderful. Even after hundreds of years, you can still see them clearly (photography is not allowed inside the buildings such as the main shrine and Yakushido).
The buildings on the precincts are basically accessed using slightly bumpy passage or stairs, which may be difficult to use for people with disabilities such as wheelchairs. There are no coin-operated lockers in the precincts, so you'll need to leave your large luggage at your hotel or in your parked car.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Wonderful Without Crowds,"An excellent place if you time your visit outside peak hours. The Covid precautions were very good. The ""roaring dragon"" is a must see.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Unforgettable experience,"This world heritage site is worth day trip to Nikko if visiting Tokyo. Straight forward to get here from Tobu Asakusa station and then a taxi or bus from Nikko station. The shrine was built for Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate that would govern Japan from 1603 until the Meiji restoration in 1867 and is a very elaborate set of different builds made out of wood with very complex and beautiful carvings and vivid colors. One of the greatest human architectural achievements.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,An absolute must for Japanese history buffs,"Easy to get to from Nikko station. Just take a bus for 200Yen from the station or get an all day pass if seeing all the sites and have time on hand.
The shrine is amazing craftsmanship in honor to Ieyasu Tokugawa Japans first Shogun after the warring states period.
I visited third week of November and there was still some lovely Autumn foliage to be seen.
The Cedars lined walkways and surrounding shrines and temples were lovely but this is definitely in my top 3 of all places visited in Japan.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A Must Visit,What a great day trip from Tokyo. The train trip from Tokyo was relaxing and once there you get on the bus that takes you to the Shrine. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and you will know why when you visit. The Shrine was completed in 1636 and it took 4.5 million artisans and workers 1.5 years to complete the groups of buildings that are more elaborate and gorgeous than any other Japanese temple or shrine. There are a lot of steps but it is doable if you are not rushed. Especially the steps to Leuasu Toshogu's grave site. One thing to know is that the Shinzo Sacred Bridge is an extra fee to cross and once you get across you have to go back across to exit that site and go on to the Shrine.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Gorgeous and stunning,"This beautiful temple is a must-see if you're visiting Japan. Wander through the temple, admire the exquisite attention to detail, and soak in the history (it was built in the 16th century). Specifically, look for the carving of the Three Monkeys, which are the basis for the ""hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil"" monkeys that are common nowadays. It's a calm place, even when there are a lot of visitors.","Written May 7, 2020"

The whole complex was financed by the son and grandson of Ieyasu Tokugawa after his death. There is also his grave, over the temple - worth to see. One of the calmest and tranquill places I saw.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Japan twice Nikko twice,"Nikko is a fantastic place, if coming by train your last link takes you onto a beautiful retro styled train up the mountainside to Nikko proper. outside the station to a countryside square. The village looks up the small valley to a forest of trees (covered in snow in my trips). If you wander up the hill you will find yourself at the start of the major shrine complex of Tosho-gu just after crossing the river. The stone steps and ramps wind their way up till you make the enormous tori gates. The complex itself has a combination of the more subtle Japanese Temples, but is also one of the most gaudy i have been to done in filigree and ivory. The carvings are stunning.

If visiting i strongly recommend bringing your Goshuincho, or purchasing one to be filled out. (Just make sure to pay your respects first), as their are several spots on site to receive the stamp.

The compound of this Shine is big and the buildings are very well preserved in each of the corner. Prepare to walk in on long and steep steps as the Shine is built on a hill. Visit in the early morning is a better strategy to avoid crowds from tour buses.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Stands out from many other shrines, super ornate","Toshugu Shrine stands different from Kyoto shrines in it’s design and ornateness, and on a misty day like the one we went provides a beautiful aura of mystery. There are many structures in the building, and a lot of the animal drawings have deep symbolic meanings. There are rooms to honor ‘Lord’ Ieyasu in whose honor it is built, and often need to queue in order to enter there. There is the crying dragon room, where they will demonstrate how it makes a noise when clapped. There is overall a sense of beauty and mystery about this shrine and it’s uniqueness in design makes it well-worth visiting. At 1300 yen a head, it’s definitely expensive. We didn’t go past sleeping cast to climb stairs as we were already very tired in our trip and didn’t want to do more to exhaust our feet.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Easy to navigate and lots of photo opportunities...,"I came here specifically because it is considered one of the most opulently decorated shrines and mausoleums in Japan.

It did not dissapoint. The location is magical, set on a mountain side amongst some towering old growth trees. It is faily compact, so can easily be navigated and there are large courtyards around all the buildings so I found it pretty easy to get nice shots without people in them. And the details are amazing - as a serious amateur photographer I really had a field day here!

However, I was lucky because it was a beautiful day and train service had been disrupted to Nikko on the Tobu railway line, so there were a lot less people than usual.

Anyway, well worth the visit and I will be back to take more photos.","Written December 6, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Absolute must-see,"Was skeptical about visiting a famous site in Japan, after having encountered zillions of tourists at other places.

I've seen many temples and shrines in Japan. Needless to say they don't hold a candle to Toshogu. Absolutely stunning.","Written December 4, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,The World Heritage Shrines of Nikko are simply stunning.,"So the first thing people need to understand is that getting to Nikko to visit the World Heritage Shrines (including Nikko Toshogu Shrine) and Shinkyo Bridge is something you can do by yourself as a Day Trip from Tokyo. BUT you do need to be leaving Tokyo early, by that I mean no later than 8:00am, by train. I will now walk you through the route I took and the costs involved, which I hope will be of great help to others.
I was staying in Shinjuku so my travel starts and ends there but as Shinjuku is a prominent and easy station to get to my route could be easily followed. Note there are other routes you can take but my research found the cost and timings of this one to be best. So from Shinjuku I took the Saikyo Line (JA) 4 stops to Akabane Station (15 minute ride). From Akabane Station I then took the Utsunomiya Line (JU) 11 stops to Kurihashi Station (46 minute ride). This portion of the journey cost JPY990 using a Suica Card (a train pre-payment card). From Kurrihashi take the Tobu-Nikko Express Line (TN) 7 stops to Tobu-Nikko Station (74 minute ride). This portion of the journey cost JPY985 on my Suica Card. I left Shinjuku Station at 8:19am and I got to Tobu-Nikko at 10:44am - So a total journey time of 2 hours 25 minutes with a total cost of JPY1,975. All the train changes were easy and when to get to Tobu-Nikko Station simply exit at the main exit and walk straight ahead to the main road then turn right and walk about 25 minutes to Shinkyo Bridge and the entrance to the World Heritage Shrines. To get back to Tokyo simply reverse the route. I left Tobu-Nikko at 5:32pm and was back in Shinjuku for 8:15pm, so a 12 hour day but this gave me plenty of time to explore all of the Shrines and the Bridge. Well worth the effort, not too expensive and an amazing cultural adventure.
I recommend buying your tickets for the Shrines you want to visit at the ticket office located in the Tobu-Nikko Station. This is far easier than fighting the long lines for tickets at the Shrines themselves. I bought tickets for all the Shrines and by doing this you get 'combination' discounts.
The Shrines themselves are beyond words, they are simply stunning and look great located in amongst the talk forest trees. A very unique experience. Do wear sensible shoes (trainers or walking shoes) as there is a fair bit of walking involved and some of it is up old steps. Not much else to say other than ""Do Go"" and do look at my pictures as they speak 1000 words.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Loved the setting and the temples,"Did this as a day trip from Tokyo, approximately 2 hours each way. Once in NIkko it is about a half hour walk to the temples. You can take a bus, but I enjoyed the walk. The walk at times is somewhat steep if you have trouble with that. The temples are basically in a large park/forest and that makes them even more lovely. A guide would have been helpful to understand more of what I was seeing, but the setting and the temples were just beautiful and a nice break from Tokyo.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Temples and shrines.,"Mostly temples and shrines. We didnt do a guided tour, but maybe that would have made a big difference.

This is absolutely a World Heritage Site, first class no doubt. The architecture is complex and elaborate in detail. There are over 100 buildings on the site and most date to the 17th Century. In particular, the shrines embody the influence of the great Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu. The artifacts contained in the shrine illustrate the power and great influence the Shoguns had.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing,For me this was the star of the World Heritage site. Well worth taking your time and exploring it all. There were a fair amount of people but that is to be expected. The carpentry and carvings are amazing and I took far too many picture to share here. You can't go to Nikko and miss out on this.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Big hordes of tourists,"1. You can purchase tickets at Tobu-Nikko station through a vending machine. This will help you save time queuing for it at the shrine. The machine accepts credit cards.

2. Alight at bus stop 7 (we took ""World Heritage Bus Loop"") and walk from Shinkyo bridge to the shrine. It's an easy 15 mins walk with some stairs along the way.

3. Be prepared to be surrounded by huge hordes of tourists, this being one of the UNESCO sites and all. Audio guides are available inside shrine (after giving ticket at entrance) for additional cost.

4. The architecture is beautiful and intricate. But other than that, it's noisy, crowded and underwhelming due to the crowds. Especially in hot summer months, this can get aggravating.

Having said that, we still enjoyed parts of Nikko for our day trip that does not have as many crowds.",

It made the atmosphere amazing and meant very few people. We loved climbing up to the tomb, even though there are lots of steep steps. This site is not to be missed- just gorgeous.","Written September 7, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Just before closure,It is worth to pay for the entrance. We planned our visit about 45 minutes before closure. It meant that we were almost the last to see everything and we were able to get beautiful pictures without a lot of people. I would recommend to do the same.,"Written September 5, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Lovely, check out the dragon shrine","Nice to walk around and see the different shrines. Make sure to check out the dragon shrine where you could hear „the roar of a dragon“, they had some explanation in Ebglish although the majority of tourists were locals so we found it very kind of them. On the opposite side, there are many stairs up leading to the tomb of the monk.. not aure how worth it except for the view from above.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing architecture,"It goes without saying that this is the place you will definitely visit when in Nikko. The architecture is amazing and the statues and decorations also.

It takes about 30 minutes to get there by foot from the station and about another hour to visit. A guide makes sense. Entrance is 1300 Yen.

If you are in a hurry, you can skip the Rinnoji temple on the way, it’s not that impressive.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Highlight of Nikko,"Beside Hakone and Mount Fuji, Nikko is one the most popular tourist destinations in Japan. And Toshogu is the highlight of Nikko. Not just the grave of Ieyasu, but Yomeimon Gate and other constructions are really worth taking a look. You shouldn’t overlook some sculptures like “sleeping cat” or “three monkeys”. You can rent an audio guide in English for $5 at the main gate. Then you can better understand the history.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A wonder,"""Nikko Tosho-gu"" is a wonder, temples and gates and pavillions are superb, there are so many incredible details: wood carved animals and plants, fine engravings, golden leaves coating, etc. Take your time to enjoy all of these amazing buildings full of art, it's a pleasure for your heart and your mind.","Written August 27, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Not enjoyable,"If you like shuffling around shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of other tourists then this is the place for you!
In my opinion this place is too commercialized and it ruins the overall atmosphere of what is a beautiful collections of shrines. After hearing about the history of Nikko I was keen to visit here but I left exhausted and disappointed.
Big tour groups ruin the experience for other travelers here with loud microphones, tens of peoples chasing after a umbrella holding guide barging anyone else in existence out of the way.
If you are not obligated to go here because of a booked tour, please go somewhere else, it will be more enjoyable. The only quiet area was up a lot of steps where it was much nicer and a good view from the top.","Written August 25, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Opulence at its best,"Having visited other Japanese shrines, this world heritage site seemed to be more about wealth than a spiritual presence. Yes the colored carvings were impressive, but the cost of 1300 yen is only for the main shrine complex. It’s another 500/900 yen for Rinnoji temples with the stunning 3 images of the female Buddha.
Be prepared to queue to hear the crying dragon caused by the acoustics in the temple and to gain entry into the main oratory.","Written August 16, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Great 1 day destination for Edo Period forested temples.,"We bought tickets days ahead for the 9 AM luxury 'Revaty"" Tobu-Nikko train from Tokyo Asakusa Station, and the 15:30 PM standard 'Spacia' for our return(~$75 for 2 which included their 2 day Nikko Pass).
After arriving at the Tobu-Nikko Station at 11 AM, we boarded the included World Heritage Bus(just outside) for the slow trip through this overcrowded town to the bus route's highest point, then joined the tourists walking 1+ km up through the shaded forested lanes to the highest UNESCO Nikko Futarasan Shrine. After the visit, we walked down to visit the 2nd UNESCO Nikko Toshogu Shrine, then down to the 3rd UNESCO Nikko Rinno-ji Buddhist Hall, then down to the UNESCO Shinkyo Bridge. From here we stopped at the nearby Hippari-Dako Restaurant(quick delicious lunch) on the 1.6 km walk down to the Tobu-Nikko Station for our return back to Tokyo.
Walking was the only reasonable option as the streets were only 'stop N go' with so many cars(only motorcycles could make any reasonable progress) on this new 2016 National holiday, ""Mountain Day"".",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Los mejores templos de Japón!,"Es una visita imperdible! Para mi fueron los templos más lindos que vi en Japón! La implantación, Nikko es un lugar divino por su naturaleza. Ni te explico si vas en epoca de florecimiento de cerezos.

Best temples in Japan! Because of the surroundings, the nature..amazing! Specially if you have the chance to see the Sakura. Nikko is a quiet place where you can rest. It´s a small and very attractive town.","Written August 12, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Unbelievable! Must Visit!,"You can see why it is a World Heritage Site. Astounding architecture in stunning landscape.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A must see in Nikko,"Checking out we drove to Nikko Toshogu 日光東照宮. It is the shrine built to worship the first generation of Tokugawa Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu 徳川家康. Ieyasu is born in Dec 1542 December at the Okazaki Castle in Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture.

He has struggled since childhood and is determined to end the warring era. He had established the Makuhari system 幕藩体制. With the resumption of order and the system to organize, promoting the industry and education, he laid the foundation of peace and culture for 260 years in the Edo period.

In 1616, Ieyasu died at the age of 75, at the Gonfu Castle 駿府城 in Shizuoka, and was buried in Kunosan 久能山. Based on his will one year later, his body was moved from Kunosan to the present place. The second generation Shogun Hidetada 秀忠 then started the construction of Toshogu.

The main structure of the present shrine is the one rebuilt in 1636 by the third generation Shogun Ikeiko 家光. Covering 55 buildings, the total investment to construct the shrine is mind-blowing, basically engaging all the best craftsmen during the time. It is now a recognized as an UNESCO site.

Almost all of the present-day shrine complex was rebuilt in 1636, twenty years after Tokugawa Ieyasu’s enshrinement. Fifty-five buildings, including Yomeimon Gate 陽明門 (designated a National Treasure), were completed in just one year and five months.

According to the shrine’s financial records, the cost was equivalent to ¥40 billion in today’s money. The renovation project was administered by Akimoto Yasutomo, the governor of Tajima Province, and the actual construction and carpentry work was under master carpenter Kora Bungo Munehiro.

One of the special features of the shrine complex is the use of paths and stairways that follow the natural topography of the site, allowing the arrangement of the shrine buildings in a pleasing balance to create a solemn, religious atmosphere.

The buildings are lacquered and decorated with vibrant colors, and the pillars and other structures are covered in a multitude of carvings. The carvings are not simply design elements; they convey expressions of religious belief as well as scholarship and philosophy.

The shrine complex was registered as a World Heritage site in December 1999.
Ishidorii (石鳥居) was dedicated in 1618 by Kuroda Nagamasa, the feudal lord of Kyushu Chikuzen (present day Fukuoka Prefecture). The stone for the gate was transported by ship from Kyushu to Koyama and then manually hauled over land to Nikko.

Gojunoto (五重塔) was dedicated in 1648 by Sakai Tadakatsu, the feudal lord of Obama in Wakasa Province (present day Fukui Prefecture). It was destroyed by fire in 1815 and rebuilt in 1818 by Sakai Tadayuki, a feudal lord of the same lineage.

Omotemon (表門) is the first gate at Toshogu Shrine. It is also called Nio Gate because of the two guardian deity statues positioned on the left and right.

Sanjinko (三神庫) is the collective designation for three buildings: Kamijinko (Upper Sacred Storehouse), Nakajinko (Middle Sacred Storehouse), and Shimojinko (Lower Sacred Storehouse). Harnesses and costumes used in the Procession of 1,000 Samurai, (a part of the Sacred Processions held in spring and fall), are kept in the storehouses. Large elephant carvings by Kano Tanyu adorn the gable of Kamijinko Storehouse. They are known as the “Imaginary Elephants.”

Shinkyusha (神厩舎) is the former a stable for the shrine’s sacred horses. There is a frieze of eight panels of carvings of monkeys running around the building, depicting the lives of ordinary people. Monkeys have been regarded as guardians of horses since ancient times. The “See No Evil, Speak No Evil, Hear No Evil” carving of three monkeys (三猿) is particularly famous.

Omizuya (御水舎) is the building with the water bath to purify body and mind by washing one’s hands and rinsing out one’s mouth before worshiping the enshrined deity. The basin was dedicated in 1618 by Nabeshima Katsushige, feudal lord of Kyushu-Saga.

Yomeimon Gate (陽明門) is a National Treasure, one of the most beautiful gates in Japan. It is said to have been given the name “Main Gate of the Imperial Court.” It is also called “Gate of the Setting Sun” because one could gaze upon it all day and never tire. It is covered with over 500 carvings depicting traditional anecdotes, children playing, sages and wise men.

Kairo (廻廊) is the exterior wall of the building extending to the left and right of Yomeimon Gate, decorated with flower and bird carvings that are considered among the best in Japan. All the carvings are single-panel openwork painted in vivid colors.

Karamon Gate (唐門) is painted with a white powder chalk, featuring intricate carvings of Kyoyu and Soho (legendary Chinese sages), an audience with the emperor, and other scenes.

Gohonsha (御本社) is another National Treasure, with the Main Shrine consisting of the Honden (Main Hall), Ishinoma (Stone Chamber), and Haiden (Worship Hall). It is the most important area at Toshogu Shrine. Annual festivals and events are conducted here. Haiden Hall is flanked by the Shogun Chakuzanoma (Shogun’s Chamber) and Hosshinno Chakuzanoma (Prince’s Chamber).

Shinyosha (神輿舎) houses the three portable shrines used in the Sacred Processions conducted in spring and fall (May 18 and October 17), while Kitoden (祈祷殿) is used to host weddings, rituals for new-born babies, and other ceremonies.

Nemurineko (眠り猫) was traditionally attributed to the master carver Hidari Jingorou. This carving of a cat dozing while surrounded by peonies and bathed in sunlight is also said to be a depiction of nikko (sunlight).

Okumiya (奥宮) is the tomb of the enshrined deity. It consists of the Haiden (Worship Hall), Inukimon Gate, and Gohoto (Two-Story Pagoda).",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A must see in Nikko. Wow,Wow . An amazingly beautiful place which was bigger than I expected. From the entrance through past the Yomeimon gate up the 270 steps to Leyasu’s treasure tower and ashes is beautiful. You visit the Sacred Fountain built in 1618 and the Pagoda . Look out for the sleeping cat carving. The shrine took two years to build and is the work of 15’000 artisans. It was a hot day when we visited and there were lots of tourists but it was still a pleasure to wander around. I must have taken at least 50 photos. I loved it all. After you visit take the left road lined with lanterns to the Taiyuin -byn shrine which is just as impressive. It took us the whole morning to wander around these two shrines. Note this is not a good place for young children or people with mobility problems due to the number of steps.,"Written August 1, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Worth a visit....,"It’s a crowded place even on a rainy day. Paid ¥1,300 for the entrance fees and worth the visit. Could easily spend a few hours here. Rich in history but felt that the architecture has some Chinese influence.

To reach the place where one of the shogun(?) was buried it’s a flight of 207 steps. Certainly not for the old who may have climbing stairs problem. The entrance is the viewing of the sleeping cat carving at the entrance of the door. It’s followed by crane carving at the second entrance. Then a short walk to the super long flight of steps.

There is also a temple that you could enter to join in the prayer (if u understand japanese). And there is another prayer room (not for prayer) which has the painted dragon on the ceiling. It’s interesting and should definitely go in (May have a queue). There are explanations and they do try to explain in simple English. Good experience!",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Kegon Falls and Nikko Pass,"Went in summer (June) and it was raining. Very cold and windy.
The cafe owner is wonderful, on the heater to keep us warm while waiting for bus ride down the hill. The Falls at the observation deck is beautiful. Cannot image when it is Spring or Autumn. The Nikko All area pass include the bus ridge from Nikko Station and also the Rope (two-way).
It is good to get a Nikko All area pass for unlimited bus rides and visits. To top up a bit more to get the unlimited express from Asakusa to Nikko (2-way)",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Awesome Sculptures at Shrine wishing for eternal peace,The sculptures are just breathtaking. EVen I visited dozens of times I haven't gotten tired of it yet. It's so amazing. This shrine has the Mausoleum of the first shogun who ruled in Edo (Older Tokyo) but almost every wall has gorgeous sculptures. A must-see in Nikko.,"Written July 5, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Wonderful!,"There are many places you must visit in the case you are nearby. However, this is a place where it is worth to have a long train from Tokyo.
Try to avoid the crowd, if you visit in a predictably crowded day, then try to get there as early as possible.","Written July 3, 2019"

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,The historic temple,"Tosho-gu is the must see temple in Nikko, and probably your Japan trip if you can spare the time. A highlight besides Tokugawa Ieyasu's mausoleum was Honjido Hall as the ""Crying Dragon"" was very interesting.
One thing I did'nt know until I arrived was that on May 17-18, Tosho-gu has a festival, something I wish I'd known before arriving(I was there the 13th).
Also as most popular temples, if you want the Goshuin, make sure you go to that counter before exploring the temple, because most likely you will have you leave your Goshuincho(your Goshuin book,you can also buy one here) here and come back for it later, there's also another Goshuin at the mausoleum's site, but that one is prewritten in a sheet of paper for an obvious reason.","Written June 14, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,An attractive historical shrine,"This was one of our destinations of Nikko tour. Since it was the Golden Week, there area was over crowded where we got stuck in traffic more than an hour to enter. We had to park the vehicle far away from the entrance and walk.

We took the steps up to the shrine which was so interesting. The complex is really vast and fascinating. Walking through the forest and huge wall fences will take you to centuries ago. Can spend couple of hours by exploring the mind blowing architecture of shrines. Although the place is over flowing with tourist, you will not get distracted to enjoy the beauty.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Great must see historical site,"We took a full day trip from Tokyo and spent the entire day in Nikko to see the Nikko Tosho-go Shrine as well as the Jizo Statues, the Shinkyo Bridge and the 3 waterfalls in the area: Kegon, Yu-daki, and Ryuzo waterfalls.

The only way to see all of this in one day from Tokyo is to take a private tour which is obviously more expensive but we got to see everything in one day and did not have to do any navigation ourselves. The tours we saw where you take a bus with 60 other people and only visit the shrine seemed very limiting and not allowing any time to see anything else. Obviously if you chose to stay in Nikko then you could probably explore the area for a couple of days.

The shrine is amazing and is currently undergoing extensive renovation. There are parts of the shrine where some of the details have been renovated in great detail and look as though it was just created. There are several buildings on the grounds; some of which you can go into if you take your shoes off and others of which you can only see from the outside.

The walk into the shrine through the forest and past the sake barrels and wine barrels takes you back in time. Depending on how much you want to see there is also a cemetery which is a long steep hike up many stairs.

You could easily spend a couple of hours exploring just this shrine and since it is very popular it is also very crowded but that did not take away from any of the amazing views or experience of the shrine grounds. The day we were there was a week where Japanese children travel in large groups so we would often wait for the group to be out of an area or go to a part of the shrine where there was less people. Anybody could do this and get away from the majority of the crowds.

I would highly recommend that you either take a private tour from Tokyo so that you can see as much as we did or go up to Nikko and spend a day or two so that you can see the area in detail.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A must see in Nikko,"If you are in Nikko you must come to the Tiago-gu. Just take in to account that it can be very crowded.
To enter in some area inside the building you need to remove the shoes",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,World heritage wonderful mossy sprawling temple,"This is the must see sight for Nikko. So nice to wander and climb amongst the unique buildings in a tranquil forest setting. The main hall is still partially covered by scaffolding as part of overrunning renovations. This a shame but still a must see. It would be 5 star when that is completed.
It can get very busy but if you stay nearby you can get there midweek before the tours.
Recommended.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Definitely something to see - just amazing,"We came to Nikko in part to see Tosho-gu and we were not disappointed. The temple complex is amazing and beautiful with lots to explore. The temple is undergoing restoration but this did not detract in any way from our visit. Much of the area has already been restored and it is beautiful, giving confidence that when all the work if finally completed, it will be amazing. I would not miss this if you are in the Nikko area. Although we stayed overnight in Nikko for two nights, one can come to Nikko from Tokyo and visit the sites and return in the same day.","Written June 4, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A lot of steps,"The grounds at this temple are expansive, and it's built into the hill. As a result, expect for there to be a lot of steps to climb if you want to see everything. As it's also a relatively famous temple, be prepared to face a lot of crowds. However, the flow is quite orderly and we weren't fighting to move around. Give yourself plenty of time to take it slow here, and you won't be stressed about having to see it all before moving on.

The traditional architecture is amazing. The place is well kept; during our visit, the inner temple was in the process of being restored. It was still open for the public to view, but there were scaffolds surrounding an inner wall.","Written June 1, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing!,"A must-do in Nikko. The shrines are absolutely beautiful and pictures really don’t do it justice. Even though it was crowded, we had a wonderful time.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing Temple and Shrine Complex,"The setting on the forested hillside imparts a sense of serenity. The gold and wood carvings are more intricate and opulent than at all other shrines. The Toshogu Shrine (Tokugawa Ieyasu's mausoleum) was extremely crowded with school children and other Japanese and international visitors. It is still an awesome site not to be missed.

For a quieter experience head further into the forest to Taiyuin, the third Shogun's mausoleum. It is smaller and just as beautiful with few visitors. Be aware that you need to go up and down at least a hundred steps. I did not count them.","Written May 30, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Must see- tips below!,"To see Nikko properly you need two full days. A day trip from Tokyo is tricky to do more than one of the following.
- TIME: You’ll have to take the JR Nikko or Tobu rail to Nikko station which takes about 40 mins from Utsumoniya. Then either walk 30 mins into town (seeing all the shops on the way) or take a bus pass so you can reach all the sights. Get there as early as possible if you’re there for the day.
- BUS PASS: about 3000 yen each for the two day pass. Or less for a day pass. It’s worth it to save your legs and time! If you only have 5 hrs then just relax and aim only for the shrines
- Toshogu and other shrines: it’s NOT cheap to go around the shrines. To get into Toshogu it’s 1300 yen as an adult and 500 yen for the audio guide. id definitely pay to go in and get the audio guide to the main sights. Lots of explanation. If you get there early you miss the crowds. This will take about 2 hours at least!
- relax over lunch: find a local restaurant to enjoy Yubu which is a local delicacy!
- Shinkyō bridge: don’t have to pay 300 yen each to cross the bridge, you get to see it very clearly and get a better photo from the man made bridge right next to it!

Lake and waterfall: if you have one day you REaLLY CANT do the shrines and this and also enjoy yourself. After taking the JR Nikko you have to take a 50-60 min bus to reach this area. Then it’s about 3-4 hrs to enjoy the walks and scenes minimum. Maybe take a sandwich, definitely take water if hiking or doing a long walking.","Written May 18, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Most beautiful shrine in Japan,"This is the most beautiful shrine I've ever visited in Japan. Every part of the shrine is carved beautifully.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Epic, gorgeous, fascinating","Toshogu is Nikko's centre-piece and I can see why - the complex is big, the buildings are ornate and beautiful, the forest is amazing. Do take the time to walk up the steps to Tokugawa Ieyasu's mausoleum, this was my favourite part. The design here is a stark contrast to the rest of the shrine complex, it's fascinating to see how different it is.

I spent about 1.5 hours here.","Written June 13, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Uplifting experience,"We took the train from Tokyo to Nikko just for the Tosho-gu, a huge complex of about a dozen Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, and it was worth it. The grand and beautifully structured Toshogu, with its pinnacle standing at equal height from sea level with the tip of Skytree Tower in Tokyo, is the centerpiece and towers above the rest. One of the shrines within complex is the final resting place of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate that ruled Japan for 250 years.","Written May 10, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Don’t miss it in every seasons.,"You should visit here to feel sacred atmosphere. You can see many special buildings, gates and etc. On the late spring, around May you can see many cherry blossoms. On summer you can see many beautiful green trees. On autumn you can see the leves colored yellow and red. And also you can see some places covered with snow in winter. You’ll see different sceneries every season here in Nikko.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,UNESCO temple.,"The purpose of this Shinto temple lies in his name. Tōshō-gū means ""Dedicated to Tokugawa."" Here is the tomb of the founder of the Tokugawa dynasty. The founder himself attached little importance to the construction of temples, and more to wars, food and women. The last two Hobbies undermined the health of the first shogun. The last will of Ieyasu was to bury him a year after his death on mount Nikko and build a small temple. The grandson was considered a small temple unbecoming the honor of a great grandfather and it was extended to its current limits. The temple combines the external simplicity in the aesthetic spirit of Wabi Sabi and the abundance of decorative carvings, the three monkeys are the most famous example. A long road and a five-storey pagoda give the temple additional solemnity.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A stand out temple to visit,"Even for people who are not really 'into' temples, I think would find this one interesting. For a start the setting with the surrounding huge trees is beautiful and peaceful - if you can ignore the crowds - but the buildings themselves are so over the top with decoration that they are without doubt the star attraction here.
There are so many different buildings that make up the complex and so many differing styles of decoration that it really does take some time to explore, and despite the fact that there was renovation going on during our visit, it didn't really impact too much or detract from the beauty of the place. A lot of signage in English helps to understand what the different structures were used for. Take your time and explore the whole precinct, there is so much to see. A definite must see in Nikko, which is itself an easy day trip from Tokyo. If you come by train, take the bus up here and then walk back, exploring the other sites along the way, as its then mostly downhill.","Written April 28, 2019"

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Gorgeous!,The buildings are brilliantly painted and decorated. The temple is being restored but you are still able to enter and look around. It is incredible to see the work that has been done. You can see some areas that are chipped and faded then others where the gold leaf glitters and the lacquer and metal work shine.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Wonderful temple landscape,"There are so many temple and shrines to visit. One day is not enough! If you have the chance to get off the beaten path and wonder through the woods, definitely do so, you’ll stumble across so many hidden temples.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Lumps of falling snow added dramatic effect to the shrine,"It was April and I didn't quite expect Nikko to be that cold, coming from a 'humid' country I was surprised. The details of the deities to the intricate structure, all in all Nikko Toshogu was stunning to look at. Expect huge crowds to be in great awe. I took the World Heritage bus (having World Heritage pass gives me free bus rides) I thought I could just be skipping Nikko Toshogu for 30 mins, but I was surprised it took me average of 2 hours tops to visit nearby shrines as well. Kosanji (in Setoda) and Nikko would be one of my best highlights as I am eager to discover new shrines outside or further from Tokyo.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,The Greatest Shrine in Japan.,"There is no question about it.This shrine is the greatest in Japan. After I visited here.I would like to write a couple of tips in order to enjoy Toshogu.
1.You have to walk.You can use a bus or taxi.But you have to walk in the shrine.Japanese love walking.But if you don't like walking.You need to give up visiting here.I was not sure if Toshogu has a courtesy wheel chair service.
2.Please study Japanese history.At least, you need to learn Ieyasu Tokugawa's achievements. This is his shrine.You need to learn him.
3.I visited here on April 17th 2019.I could enjoy sakura flowers(Cherry blossoms) It was relatively warm.But Nikko is usually cold like Canada or North Europe.I guess that months from April to October are a good time to go.
4.Please respect no photograph policies.Toshogu doesn't allow you to take pictures at some of the buildings.
5.If you can, please walk from Nikko stations to Toshogu.There are many interesting stores restaurants. There is a tourist information center between the stations and Toshogu.
6.Please try local cuisine 'Yuba"".(tofu skin)/
Enjoy Nikko!",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing!,"The Tosho-gu located at Nikko is an amazing collection of fortifications and buildings dedicated and built during the Edo period ruled by the Tokugawa family (Shogunate). You literally stride through history following in the footsteps of samurai & the shoguns. As you walk underneath the Torii gates, marvel at the 5-story pagoda with it's center pole designed to withstand earthquakes (light years ahead of it's time), the Yōmeimon (Gate of Sunlight) that is literally jaw-dropping in it's beauty and intricate detail. Traversing the walkway and stairs (207) that lead to the tomb of Ieyasu Tokugawa, take a moment to look out & realize you are standing in the same spots where samurai once stood guard. To view everything one should plan on spending at least a day & even then you will not see everything. There is considerable walking involved so prepare accordingly with appropriate clothing & footwear, but you will need to slip your shoes off to enter some of the structures. Tosho-gu is not to be missed & cannot wait to return.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Spectacular Shinto Shrine part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Expect crowds.,"We took a day trip by train to Nikko from Tokyo. We stepped out of Nikko train station and caught a [very crowded] bus just outside. We exited at a Shinkyo bridge, a short ride away. From there, we crossed the street, went up some stone steps and made our way on foot to the temple.

The temple itself is comprised of several different buildings. It's pretty spectacular with its golden accents, carvings, statues, shrines, lanterns and gates, etc. There are lots of stairs and be prepared to take your shoes off to go inside. Also don't miss the 'Crying Dragon Ceiling' room.

We were there in the autumn when the bright leaves added an extra pop of color contrast, so I recommend this time of year.

While in the area, we enjoyed a lunch at the cafe on the walkway up to the temple, we took photos of the Shinkyo bridge and walked to Kammangafuchi Gorge.

This one, however is up there. Well worth the train journey and the climb up seemingly endless steps. Do it all if you can . Maybe not the inside of the pagoda though. We didn’t. It seemed pointless. It’s beauty is on the outside.","Written April 5, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Well worth the trip to Nikko,"I was not sure of what to expect after having visited the major shrines in Tokyo, but I was amazed.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,The path to enlightenment,"This incredible shrine and temple complex is full of history, culture and for us even symbolism. We climbed the many stairs on a cold and foggy morning to uncover many treasures of the Edo era and learn about the first shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Surrounded by mystical forests and light rain, we reached the shogun's grave at the peak and immediately the sun lit up all around us, melting the last of the frost. It really did feel like we'd ascended a trail of mystery and returned as wiser and more enlightened people.","Written April 1, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Must do Day trip if visiting Tokyo,"We travelled from Tokyo to Nikko. Took about 2 hours. Stopped at Nikko Train station. Purchased what the local call the “free buss pass” which is free once you purchase the bus pass. Bus pass Cost about 2000 yen each. This took us to the temple and then to Kegan Falls. You will need 8 hours to do Nikko and Fagan falls. Return pass to temple only was just about 300 yen and since the temple is up hill it’s well worth it. All I’ll say is, if you don’t make a trip to Nikko temples, you will be missing out in one of the most beautiful locations in the World. Get up early and go. Trust me on this one! As for Kegan Falls, that in another review.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Walking Through History,"The Tosho-gu located at Nikko is an amazing collection of fortifications and buildings dedicated and built during the Edo period ruled by the Tokugawa family (Shogunate). You literally stride through history following in the footsteps of samurai & the shoguns. As you walk underneath the Torii gates, marvel at the 5-story pagoda with it's center pole designed to withstand earthquakes (light years ahead of it's time), the Yōmeimon (Gate of Sunlight) that is literally jaw-dropping in it's beauty and intricate detail. Traversing the walkway and stairs (207) that lead to the tomb of Ieyasu Tokugawa, take a moment to look out & realize you are standing in the same spots where samurai once stood guard. To view everything one should plan on spending at least a day & even then you will not see everything. There is considerable walking involved so prepare accordingly with appropriate clothing & footwear, but you will need to slip your shoes off to enter some of the structures. Tosho-gu is not to be missed & cannot wait to return.","Written March 20, 2019"

Of course, this is the most famous. And hence, with an expensive entry fee but yet teeming with people. Yet, it does not seem right to not visit it being the iconic shrine of the area.

Nonetheless, the gates and structures of the temple are very impressive indeed with intricate carving details. The size of this temple is large enough, with even royal stable was located inside. To visit the tomb of Tokugawa Ieyasu, you need to take 207 steps uphill. Not recommended for those with faint heart condition.",

I read that there are over 100 building at this temple complex. I'm glad we decided to to stay there for 2 days because it takes a while to see most of it.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Mind-boggling,"Nikko can be reached from Tokyo within about two hours (50 minutes to Utsunomiya by Shinkansen, 50 minutes by local JR line). The Tosho-gu is the resting place of Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu whose soul was interred here in the sixteenth century. You walk up a slightly steep slope, pay your admission fee (1300 Yen/adult) and enter the shrine grounds. Here you find the original painting of the three apes (don't hear, don't speak, don't see). Pay close attention to the intricate timber work of the roofs - carpentry at its best. Different buildings show splendour and attention to detail. A good time to visit is late afternoon on a autumn day, when the foliage is particularly striking.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Most impressive,"We took the Tobu line from Asakusa to Nikko. Nikko is a world heritage site founded by the Buddhist monk, Shado Shomin.
Entrance to the shrine is via the Niomon gate. To the left after the entrance are the storehouses and the sacred stable with the famous three wise monkeys carving.
The whole area is massive and there are many steps to negotiate. Very ostentatious gates and pillars throughout

You can walk to this from the station though buses are available",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Big temple area with many easy to miss details.,"There are many things to see at this temple ground. You wont fail to see the carvings of the three monkeys. However, there are a lot more carvings around the temple area. Many of them made from single wood. They look extremely delicate and alive. Take your time to view those pieces as well.
A bit further up the hill of the temple area you will find the cat everyone mentions. It is a small cut out sitting above a door. The door leads stone stairs, that leads to a small tomb. It's a nice walk for those who don't mind to sweat a little bit.
On our way out of the exit we visited the temple with the crying dragon. It was a bit confusing navigating the line, because apparently it was one line for women and the other for men. When we came in there were some explanations in english, but mostly in Japanese. However, the show the priest put on was well worth the time spent waiting(not that long on a week day). The interesting thing about this temple is that there is no echo in there unless you stand at a specific place (at the dragons mouth). The priest demonstrated this by hitting two wooden pieces together at random places and then under the dragons head. When under the head of the dragon, you could hear the echo of the sound of the wooden pieces - the roar of the dragon.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,The star attraction in Nikko,"We reached this world famous shrine on foot in about 10 minutes after visiting the Rinnoji Temple. As suspected the place was packed even on a working day. Tickets for visit to the shrine will set you back by 1300 yen which you can also purchase from a machine using credit card. The shrine premise is fairly large and there are plenty of things to see in this wonderful shrine. Luckily only a portion of the roof of the main shrine is covered by construction materials. Before entering the main shrine you will see the 5-storeyed pagoda( although this is free to see, unless you pay the fees and go in you will have no idea about the magnificence of the shrine).The Yomeimon Gate is truly marvellous. You have to walk below the sleeping cat and climb more than 250 odd steps to reach what is called the inner shrine which really is a simple grave of the first shogun. If you do not care for it you need not climb all these steps. Your ticket contains a tab for entrance to the “Crying Dragon” which are paintings on the ceiling of a hall. You have to remove your shoes( you can carry them in a plastic provided or leave behind in pigeon holes though the priest suggested we do the former).Photos are not allowed inside and a priest makes a show of hitting two pieces of wood below the dragon with Japanese commentary. There was a sign saying that English commentary is available. But when I pointed it to the priest he said “ No English”. Photos are also not allowed inside the main shrine. You will need about a hour inside premises. At the exit there is s public toilet. At the end of it you praise the Lord for giving you the opportunity of witnessing such a marvel.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Decent temple,"Spent the day here and it is a very nice temple. 2hrs by train from Tokyo so it’s quite a nice day trip. You can get the bus outside the station to the temple.

One thing to note, in Japan you get on the bus at the back entrance and you exit the bus by the front which is when you pay.

Note the number on the screen on the bus when you get on. It will say your stop number and a price, you pay that as you get off. It’s about 290 yen per person from the station to the temple, so have change on you.",

As we climbed the mountain, we noticed many redwood trees in the surrounding forests. In the main temple complex, huge redwood trees nearly 4 feet in diameter marked a perimeter area. Definitely a must see attraction when visiting Nikko!","Written November 1, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Festival,"The shrine is an easy walk up from the station but it would pay to get a map from the tourist office as we didn't and had to use our phones to work out where we were - probably means we missed some lovely sights in Nikko.

We lucked out in the timing of our visit and got to see the October festival where the deity is moved from a temporary shrine down the hill back to to his main shrine in a re-enactment of his original interment. The re-enactment is call the parade of the thousand Samurai even though there have only ever been 800!

Very interesting display and there was good English commentary so we had an idea of what we were looking at and their significance.

After the parade and the ceremonies in the temple it was very crowded so we popped to the museum to let things quieten down.

The shrine complex is very ornate and garishly decorated. Got to see the original carvings for the 3 monkeys then climbed the steps to view the more simple tomb of the man himself.","Written October 31, 2018"

This shrine is probably most famous for the three monkeys of no evil carving, but I particularly liked the sleeping cat carving. Do beware that the sections with stairs, which you will need to ascend in order to visit Tokugawa Ieyasu's grave, are steep and numerous. I heard one woman audibly gasp when turning a corner to see how high they were and saw several kids slip (I was there on a very hot and humid day with several brief rain showers).

The place is lovely. It is located on the mountain, between giant trees; you walk and feel the peace and the charm of the place.
The buildings, unlike the other temples we visited in Tokyo, are abundant in details and decorations: flowers, birds, and dragons, which show the talent of the artists who worked on them.
Visitors can see the mausoleum of a Shogun climbing hundreds of steps of a stone staircase, which although it looks very steep, is not fatiguing, and if you need to rest, you can stop and recreate with the landscape.
We went looking for the sculptures of the three wise monkeys and we found with surprise a charming place, which is considered Unesco World Heritage site and I recommend it as a must if you visit Japan.","Written August 13, 2018"

The Toshogu itself is a perfectly restored world heritage site that really does show the best of Edo times artful structures.","Written August 8, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A beautiful UNESCO heritage site that is located very close to the Tobu World Square,"We have visited several Japanese Temples/Shrines in Japan but this one really seemed a bit different and unique.

We observed that there are about 5 structures in this wonderful place including a very beautiful 5 storied Pagoda surrounded by nature all around the site. Also part of the beauty is the row of majestic trees lining the roadway, which is termed as the Cedar Avenue of Nikkō.

However, to go to the main site, one needs to undergo a very steep walk (that involves hundreds of very steep steps) and that is quite an ordeal for people who are not used to regular walks. But I have to admit that even for an avid/daily walker, I found the walk quite a challenge but it was surely worth it.

Once we successfully reached the top and saw the magnificent structures and shrines, all our troubles seemed to have disappeared :).

For us the highlight was ""The stable of the shrine's sacred horses bears a carving of the three wise monkeys, who hear, speak and see no evil ""

The 5 storied Pagoda also caught our attention especially due to its history. Each story of the Pagoda represents the famous five elements i.e. earth, water, fire, wind and aether/Void. We were told by a couple of monks in the shrine that this building was destroyed by fire in the 1600s and was later rebuilt in the early 1800s.

We certainly recommend this beautiful UNESCO site especially to all those tourists who visit the Tobu World Square as the Nikko Tosho-gu is located just 10 kms from it.

It was pretty chilly in April fortunately that made the climb easier. I'd go back here again. It's beautiful. Don't forget to pick up a charm or two.,"Written July 10, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Shrine to a Shogun,It’s all pretty cool considering this entire place exists to commentate a dead feudal lord from the late 1500’s who is buried here since 1617 atop a forest of ancient trees. A lot of emphasis on the dragon is part of the ritual and attraction. A bit expensive as far as admissions go. Be prepared to remove your shoes a few times.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Worth the trouble to pay a visit from Tokyo,"There are no direct trains on JR from Tokyo, but it was still worth the effort to pay a visit to the world heritage site at Nikko.

It is the most elaborate memorial I have seen in Japan.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Colourful,"Tosho-gu is one of the temples that have a hefty entrance fee as it is more of a museum than a temple. Of course the temple itself is worth visiting with its elaborate decorations and beautiful buildings, but the number of (foreign) visitors and lack of worshippers have turned this sight in a kind of open air museum. It definitively lacked atmosphere, but makes for some colourful pics.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Overwhelmingly Beautiful,"A must visit for any visitor to Japan. All the history, delightful Japanese intricate architecture, culture, history, serenity....all rolled into one. This entire place will set you back as there are multiple entry fees to different sites. But it's all worth while. Take your time and budget sufficient time to soak in the wonders of this place. We spent 1 entire day here. Can't get enough of it.","Written June 18, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Best in Nikko!,"By far the best in Nikko! I guess when you’re one of the most famous leaders in Asian history- you get a good resting place. I have walked up a lot of stairs and seen a lot of old, famous, dead people’s resting place- this one is one of the best! Well kept and easy to navigate through. Don’t miss it!!",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Largest and most Impressive Temple/shrine,"I would like to point out that after spending the day on this trip from Tokyo there is so much to see around Nikko and a 2-3 days would have been better. The train from Ueno to Utsunomiya then change for Nikko takes around 2hrs and is free with a J-R Railpass. Catching the World heritage bus from Nikko station 500 yen for loop hop on hop off bus,this has got to be the most impressive temple/shrine on the trip . Spread over a large area within the forest ,There are many levels to walk up and investigate some great Japanese history/culture , this is the resting place of one of the great Shoguns to unify Japan.The ornate buildings/shrines statues are wonderfully carved and guilded , i believe this temple gets really busy at weekends ,during the week was quieter. Its a must visit if your in the Nikko area,Don' forget the camera , not an easy climb on all levels there are quite a few steps , but there is plenty to see on the lower levels also .",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Worth It,"While I can't say that I am a fan of the touristy town of Nikko, nor the natural park surroundings which only come into their own after the dry season ends, the temple complex is worth the visit. The details, decorations, layout, and overall feel make this a must see.","Written June 2, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Wrong day to visit,"We accidentally chose the worst day possible to visit this national monument. This is where the first Tokugawa Shogun is buried. The day we chose to visit is during both Taiwan, China and Japan national holiday. The line was crazy, takes about three hours to just step into the temple ground. No photo inside and the mob was just crazy. The friend who went with us did a tour in Japan riding Harley Davidson motorcycle in the past, they ran into barely any tourist at all. Sigh.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A must-see if you are interested in Japanese history.,"This shrine is a must see if you are interested in the history of Japan. Not only is the architecture magnificent (like every other temple and shrine in Japan), but also because it is the final resting place of Tokugawa Ieyasu (although that appears to be a point of contention), one of the three unifiers of Japan. It was absolutely amazing being able to visit the shrine and I am very glad that I was able to witness it when I was in Japan.

Be sure to watch the movie that is played in the nearby museum about Tokugawa Ieyasu, it is an extremely awe inspiring story about his life. The museum also holds some of Ieyasu's possessions which are magnificent to pore over.

If you already know about the history of Japan you must come here to honour the legend that was Tokugawa Ieyasu.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Highlight of Nikko,This is the main spot of Nikko. The ancient temples/shrines are very beautiful and cannot be missed. Also the fact that they surrounded by tall trees on all sides makes it even more beautiful. There are quite a few steps to climb and walk if you wish to visit the entire complex so be ready for it.,"Written May 27, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Very impressive temple,"I think that this place is one of the highlights of Nikko. There are a lot of remarkable spots to visit in the area. All are different from other traditional Japanese temples. In conclusion, it is a must visit place if you go to Nikko.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Impressive resting ground of Tokugawa,"The ground was grand and the surrounding forests and trees towering around the temple feels appropriate for the final resting place of the legendary Tokugawa Ieyesu. There were a lot of visitors, both domestic and overseas, lining up to visit the shrine where Ieyesu lies in rest under the impressive bronze pagoda, which is located in the back of the ground. Other structure and relics were all designated cultural treasures of Japan and well worth a visit.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Wonderful Must-See Shrine in Nikko!,"If you are in Tokyo, I highly recommend taking a short train ride to Nikko (1.5 hours). There are so many things to see and do! Just beautiful!!

My wife and I visited from Canada in May 2018. We walked to Toshogu Shrine from the train station - about 45 minute walk (one way). The shrine has many colourful and decorative structures.

It was quite busy with crowds, so it may be worthwhile to visit during non-peak times. That being said, Nikko is a very popular destination.

I recommend Toshogu shrine very much!!",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Very nice, quite pricy, a lot of people","We were told not to go on the weekend but today we got a lot of guided tours and schools, what makes difficult to visit. The entrance fee is 1300 yens. If you want to visit the other big temple it is 900 yens and you can't get a combined ticket",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing,"Incredible place to visit, lot of temple, beautiful details, lot of people, opened only until 5pm. Need at least 2hours to visit all the temple outside and inside","Written May 4, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Worth the trip !,Definitely a must go place if you visit Japan. It is magnificent series of historical monuments (39!) in a beautiful setting. It is peaceful and inspiring. It does not have the reputation of Kyoto but the main gate “Yomeimon” is second to no monuments in Kyoto and in itself is worth the trip.,"Written April 27, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Fascinating historical site,"This can be a day tour from Tokyo. Train access to this site is very convenient. There is a direct train from Shinjuku to Nikko. If you miss it, there are plenty of options to transfer trains. The local bus to Toshogu runs every 15 min, a day bus ticket costs JPY500.

Recommend to get audio guide at JPY 1000 for 3 sets in order to appreciate the history. Must see are the 3 monkeys, the sleeping cat, the imaginary elephant and the beautiful Yomeimon.

After the visit, one should try the local specialty Yuba (bean curd) at the restaurants near the Nikko station. If you have time enjoy the public onsen at the hotel opposite the Nikko train station for only JPY700 per person.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Must see!,"This is a great one day tour from Tokyo. The tour I took also went to lake Chuzenji and Kegon cascade, all beautiful places but the shrine is the best. The woodwork, different temples, buildings, the dragon call, etc make this probably the most magnificent shrine I saw. The tomb of Shogun Tokugawa is there","Written April 23, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Vacation,"WOW !!, What an amazing palace. The setting is absolutely stunning with all the ceder trees buildings. Some of the best architecture and use of color ever. This place is massive and very crowded. So many perfect picture opportunities everywhere. You need to set aside at least two hours for this site alone. Then probably another three to four hours for the other sites close by, very short walking distance. I so highly recommend this place. Five stars. Great for the entire family or just couple's.","Written April 21, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A beautiful heritage site!,The Toshu-go complex is huge and very interesting! The shrines and temples within are rich in culture. We also climbed the 207 stone steps to the tomb of the shogun high above the shrine which only a few people frequented maybe because it isn't identified well.,"Written April 16, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Fantastic,Well worth the trip out of Tokyo. We were on a tour so only had 90 mins to visit so it was more rushed than we would have liked.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Nikkō Toshogu Shrine,,"Written April 15, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Simply stunning,"Amazing Shinto Shrine situated a couple of hours from Tokyo and easily reached by rail and then either a short bus ride or 2 km walk from the station (though the rather pretty town). The Shrine is a stunning example, combining Chinese, Thai and Japanese architectural and artistic influences. It is much more ornate than many other Shinto shrines I've visited, with beautiful wood carving, reliefs and painting. Worth spending some time here and slowly wandering through the whole complex - not just rushing up to the three monkeys (and I found the famous sleeping cat rather underwhelming in comparison with everything else here). Some great views and the whole site is surrounded by beautiful forest. Plenty of small restaurants in the nearby town, but not much on site (which is a good thing). The monks showing groups around speak some English, which was helpful. Well worth a visit.","Written April 15, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,THE temple to visit,If you only see one temple in Japan this should be it. Staying overnight inNikko allowed us to be at the temple before any crowds. We didn’t hire audio guides and found there was sufficient information in English around the sights to give us adequate background information. Bring a walking stick if you have mobility issues as there are some stairways without rails. The carvings and colours are beautiful. I think we were lucky that most of the restoration work is almost completed. The entrance ticket included access to all areas.,"Written April 11, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,worth the visit,"We came to Nikko mainly because of the Toshogu. The sumptuous decoration and maintenance done are simply amazing. We were first shocked by the entrance fee - 1300 yen per adult. In hindsight, we know that this price is only a small token in view of the money and efforts to restore and maintain such a beautiful temple.

Absolutely worth the visit.","Written April 9, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Beautiful,Be prepared for lots of walking (and climbing). The place is a very popular tourist spot so theres usually many people there. There are also some small shops selling foods and lucky charms within the area. You can also borrow an audio guide to do a self-guided tour. Overall a pleasant experience.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Amazing place, very touristy",Really good atmosphere here nice buildings and amazing artwork. The forrest is very deep and sacred. Some good hours you can spend visiting. I would normally avoid touristy crowded places but this is worthe a shot despite of the amount of people.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A must see,"At 2100 Yen for museum and shrine it’s not cheap but I think it was worth it . The architectural detailing on the buildings is outstanding.there’s a lot of steps so not suitable for push chairs or people with walking difficulties .
The small museum in nicely laid out with a good dateline for the Tokugawa reign .",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Unfair prices,"Most expensive temple I did so far (and not the most impressive). It is really nice though with all the colors of the temple from the recent renovation (still under renovation at the time I went), but Nikko in general is the first city I did which tries to take advantage of tourism with unfair prices for food, hostel, bus pass and even train (2500¥ for 40 minutes while in other places I paid only 800¥ for the same time...). I hope they change their politics to fit with all the others places of Japan. Not worth the price they ask if you want to do the trip from Tokyo in my opinion.","Written March 27, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,UNESCO heritage site,"If you’re going to come to Nikko this is the place to go. Very touristy (read: lots of people, even on a week day) and also a bit pricey at ¥1300 entry. Also check out the equally impressive Taiyū-in temple nearby.","Written March 27, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Excellent, but go early","This is an absolutely must-see when in Nikko. My husband and I went to the other temples/shrines/mausoleums before going to the big one, probably best to do in that order. Get the English audio guide for ¥500 (we got one between the two of us), it makes the tour more impressive with the information they provide. GO FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. The crowds, particularly the bus tour groups, get ridiculous as the day goes on. We went on a Monday at 11am and it was very busy.","Written March 26, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Great place but too crowded,"It was too crowded to enjoy such a historical place. With a heaving crowd, it was hard to take good pictures of the shrines, without people standing in front of it. Perhaps do a research on when is the best time to visit during off peak season .",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Good point for a day trip,"The unesco world heritage area of Nikko including the various shrines are well worth a day trip from Tokyo. Nikko is reachable by the Tobu line from Asakusa tobu station with a 2-2.5hr journey.
The shrine is reachable by buses outside the Nikko tobu station, short journey.
Entrance fee to the site including the Cat, and 3 monkeys is 1300jpy. The lady manning the entrance ticket sales is quite rude in fact as I enquired if discounted tickets were available for daytrip passes she brusquely said NO very loudly before shutting the window rudely and proceeded to another window to serve Japanese visitors.
Otherwise the inner yard and the old structure is very well preserved however the restored areas look too shiney and plasticky. On a beautiful day this shrine is quite impressive as one can see the carvings and paintings quite clearly.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Great experience,"One of the most important temple in Japan, due to the fact that the one of the most important Shogun was buried here.

The area is full of interesting temples and shrines.
Moreover this place is also famous for the 3 monkeys...",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Beautiful shrine,Beautiful shrine. Lots of walking and climbing. The restored part is amazing in color. The children had a good time. I would recommend taking the audio guide. We did not and certainly missed a lot,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Shrine with spiritual power,"We visited Tosho-gu during one of the coldest season.
The coldness seemed to give even more power to the shrines.

The shrine building has a lot of decoration featuring animals. Not only the famous Three Monkeys and Sleeping Cat, but there are birds and other animals curved into the buildings.

Worth visiting once in a lifetime.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Beautiful and peaceful,"This is an interesting shrine and we took a day trip from Tokyo to visit this shrine and a few others. Renovations to the main gate had just been completed, very shiny and clean and in my view detracts slightly from the expected ""look"" for an ancient shrine. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant experience, we did not feel crowded out although there were many folks visiting at the same time but getting a nice picture was a little difficult. Do take the many steps up to the reputed resting place of the shogun (but this part is not for old folks or very young children). You can take the shuttle bus from the nikko station but please be mindful of the timings in case you need to take the train back to Tokyo on the same day.","Written February 20, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Worth the trip from Tokyo,I traveled three hours from Tokyo to visit the Nikko Tosho-gu shrine and it was so worth it! The most beautiful shrine I've seen in Japan by far. It's full of history and in the mids of picturesque nature. I paid 500 yen for the English audio guide and it was great! Concise and not long dreaded as you can choose which elements you wish to know more about. I'd definitely recommend it to appreciate the place more.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,World heritage site amongst the forest giants,"A remote site nestled amongst Mother Nature demanding respect and solitude. Definitely a place of majesty and awe of old Shogun days.

Well worth the long car trip from Tokyo!",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Needs to be seen In person,"Nikko makes for a great day trip from Tokyo by train. Pictures don't do the shrines and temples justice In the slightest.
I recommend buying the passes that cover all of the shrines as they really are all worth seeing. You will be doing a lot of walking and to see everything will take a while so arrive at a sensible time and allow for this.
Its such a beautiful and historic place to visit.","Written February 4, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,a peak into history,"toshogu shrine is a place one can't miss if visiting Japan, specially one has any remote interest in history & culture

you can reach Nikko easily by car or train, how ever anybody who visiting Japan and have done little research would know that driving is the least expensive mode of transport in Japan if you don't get any traffic tickets, that is.

January sees a moderate snow fall in the area and so it is advisable to be prepared
specially for windy weather.

I would advice to visit the museum first which is right before entering the shrine and watch the video and the movie before you enter shrine so that it is easy and much more relatable to observe shrine.

Management at the place is excellent as most attractions in Japan.

overall a must visit place irrespective of the weather.","Written February 2, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Worth seeing the shogun shrine,"Impressive temple and shrine buildings.

Worth taking the stairs up to the pagoda.

We visited in march on a Friday but place is still far too busy. Tons of people walking around which clearly impacts atmosphere of the place.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Well worth a couple of hours wandering and exploring,"The shrine / tomb of Tokugawa Ieyasu is well worth a visit. Don't stop at the Rinno-Ji (currently being restored inside a huge 7-story tall shed), but turn left and keep walking up the hill.

The road(?) is wide, and flanked by majestic trees, and when you reach the torii gate, then you've arrived - and your exploration starts. There are too many individual buildings to list them all here - but make sure you see inside the shrine itself, trek up the stone steps to see Tokugawa's surprisingly modest tomb, and breath in the peace and quiet.

On the way back down, turn right and see the temple of the roaring dragon. A clever acoustic trick turns echoes into a piercing shriek that goes right through your head. Don't worry - there is a priest handy to demonstrate how it all works (and damage your hearing in the process).

Stop at the museum and spend half an hour looking at the exhibits, and then stop into the Rinno-Ji on your way out.","Written January 15, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Large complex with great structures, very crowded","The temple complex is spread out and the structures as well as the surroundings are wonderful. It is extremely popular and crowded, so you don't entirely get to fully appreciate the beauty. We were here during the Nikko Culture week in November, and perhaps that added to the popularity. Overall the complex is great and adds to the allure of Nikko.","Written January 12, 2018"

This is a visit that you cannot miss if you are in Nikko. The temples are still in function. I recommend visiting it during weekdays, since at weekends, there are long lines to enter and it gets very crowded. A world heritage site, there is a fee for entrance. Highly recommended!",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A beautiful tribute to a shogun. Many stairs involved.,"As I was 5 mths and rather heavily pregnant, the visit to this beautiful shrine was a little tough for me because of the sheer number of stairs we needed to climb.

But the shrine is definitely worth the visit as it is the only one in Japan with 12 buildings lavishly decorated with gold leaf and carvings.

This tribute to the first Shogun of Japan, founded a shogunate that ruled for 250 years. And this was built by his grandson in memory of this powerful man.

I would highly recommend the audio tour as while descriptions of each landmark or feature are brief, it is much better to know what is going on. As it is easy to just get caught up with the crowds and not notice the special features of the palatial place where the shoguns remains have been laid to rest.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A must-see for any World Heritage lover,"There are few places on earth where one can hit up 3 World Heritage sites in one day, so Nikko is a contender for the ""super achiever"" award if you`re a Heritage Site junkie.

If you lean more to the Japanophile side, you cannot find a better example of the excesses of the early Edo Shogunate; if you are interested in Shintoism and the veneration of once-living people as gods post-mortem, then you also are in the right place.

Even if you don`t fall into either of the previous categories, Nikko Toshogu is a beautiful place to experience traditional (albeit blinged-out) Japanese architecture, and see firsthand(eye?) some of Japanese most enduring motifs (like the Three Monkeys - hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil.)

There are many structures to explore, but you are almost guaranteed a huge crowd at nearly any time of the day. If you can, avoid Japanese national holiday times and come here on a weekday... maybe it will be less packed!

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Very interesting!,It was interesting to see this place for its rich culture and history that dates back to the Edo period. It was good that we joined a tour group (Sunrise Tours JTB) as the tour guide was able to explain (in English) the many stories behind this place and why it is often visited.,"Written October 11, 2017"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Nikko UNESCO World Heritage day tour,"This tour was our first one on this vacation. It started early since we had to catch the collecting bus in Shibuya which is a short cab ride from Shinjuku where we were staying. We opted for a cab ride instead of taking the subway because we were a bit intimidated.

The tour started at the JTB bus station amid an atmosphere of organized chaos. Since it was a Sunday, there were tons of tourists scrambling about trying to find their buses and tour guides. The staff appeared to be used to this and were very helpful in shepharding the tourists to their designated boarding stations.

After finally boarding the bus and settlibg in our reserved seats, we were finally able to relax abd enjoy the three hour ride to Nikko. Our tour guide gave us a running commentary of the various places we passed but it took us a while to get used to her accent and beand of humor. Overall, she was informative and thorough in her presentation.

Once in Nikko, we found ourselves in the midst of a sea of tourists that contrasted against the stoic tempkes and shop proprietors. The brochure pictures gave us the impression of serenity but in actuality, we were rubbing shoulder-to-shoulder in a dense crowd positioning for the ideal angles to take the perfect photograph. If you were expecting serenity, think again. But since it was a Sunday, people, from groups of students to group tours, serenity was no where to be found.

Don’t get me wrong. The place has a lot to offer in terms of history and architectural wonders. It was just too crowded. It didn’t help that our tour guide, Kimiko, navigated the crowded path a bit too fast for the our group that staying together was a bit of a challenge.

After leaving the UNESCO World Heritage site, we were treated to a keiseki style lunch which started a bit late because one of the members of our group got lost comibg back to the bus. Since the Japanese are sticklers when it comes to schedules, something had to give - lunch hour was cut short to 45 minutes. A keiseki lunch provides a lot of food and 45 minutes barely gives you enough time to finish.

From Nikko, the tour proceeded to Lake Chuzenji and Kegon Falls. Lake Chuzenji is an alpine lake with crystal clear waters. Kegon Falls was a short ride away and offered great views of the cataract from afar.

The ride back took three hours with a pit stop along the way. By the time we got back to our apartment, we were pooped!

Overall, the tour was informative with interesting man made structures and natural beauty of the Japanes country side. I only wonder if we took the tour during a weekday would make a difference between wading through a crowd like salmon swimming up river or less stressful with thinner crowds.

I recommend taking the tour but not on a Sunday.",

At the entrance, you can see the famous monkeys, speaking no evil, seeing no evil, hearing no evil. Actually I liked the mother and kid monkeys next to those 3 monkeys. I also liked to hear the raring dragon's voice. Only thing that i was not quite pleased, they do not have any explanation in English. I could only catch some words, but still OK. At the major place, I could understand how to pray in Japanese way. He said, bow 2 times first, than 2 times claps, then one more bow.

Recently, some of the national monuments were damaged by a couple of foreigners. By the time the authority traced them, they were out of japan.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Audio guide is mandatory for an authentic experience!!,"Nikko Tosho-gu is located in a remote part in Japan, well north of Tokyo. The shrine itself is grand and magnificent, a 15-20 minute walk from most car parks in Nikko and a necessity if you are lucky enough to be staying in the Japanese countryside. After walking through the forest to Nikko Tosho-gu, the shrine takes approximately 1-1.5 hours to explore in depth, comprised of many gates and magnificent buildings. The entry fee itself is far above the numerous shrines I visited in Japan (1300 Yen), which is very steep, although this cannot be avoided. As there are no English signs at all, I really didn't understand the huge number of foreigners who just strolled around the shrine, as they wouldn't have been able to learn anything about the shrine itself, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, the shogun who the shrine was dedicated to. At 500 Yen, the English audio guide is well informed and I learned so much from it, being able to actually understand the significance of the shrine, and what all the minuscule details about it actually meant. It is a complete necessity to use. For someone who is going to Japan for the first time, this would definitely not be near the top of a list of sights to go to, although more seasoned visitors may want to take a day trip to Nikko, and explore the beautiful town as well as the magnificent shrine itself.","Written August 27, 2017"

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Magical Nikko,"My husband and I visited Nikko in May 2016 on a short day trip from Tokyo. We walked from the station, and while it took roughly 20-30 minutes, it's a lovely walk, aside from the big tour buses passing by. You begin to hear water trickling in hidden pipes by the side of the road, and reaching the bridge was so exciting. We paid to enter the bridge, which wasn't really necessary. Photos of the bridge are really incredible, however.

The shrine itself took our collective breath away. We had read it was one of the most ornate in Japan, and in retrospect, after the rest of our trip, I'd have to agree. The sheer size of it is difficult to render in photos as well. Nestled in the trees and beside rushing water, it's hard to imagine the artisans who created such beauty.

For us, Nikko was a must, and we recommended it to friends who were going shortly after us as well. It was that good.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Top most shrine to visit in Nikko,"Visited Toshogu Shrine during summer in June 2017.

I must say this Shrine is very beautiful. The decoration is just amazing. Even the wood carvings is very detailed. Spots that you shouldn't miss is the three monkeys and the sleeping cat. Go past the sleeping cat door and walk the stairs up Ieyasu Tokugawa mausoleum.

Toshogu shrine should be on your top most list.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing shrine and location,"Starting from the famous red Shinkyo bridge crossing the Daiya river, where everyone competes to get a pic, you can make your way, uphill towards the Tosho-gu shrine. It’s a bit of a hike and plenty of slippery steps but nothing too strenuous unless you’re really out of shape. The shrine itself is well worth the visit, the earlier the better because the crowds can get a bit uncomfortable once the tour coaches arrive. We were staying locally which I would recommend rather than doing just a day trip from Tokyo because there is so much more to see, and some pretty amazing walks if you follow the Daiya river upstream to the Kammangafuchi Gorge.","Written July 12, 2017"

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Longest Journey By Local Trains!,"Wanted to go to Mt Fuji 5th station but was advised against it due to cloudy weather. So did not book a group tour for the next day. The girls at Ikebukuro JR East office suggested not to book any type of outdoor tours due to the rainy season but if weather is good go to Nikko. Could not buy the Nikko All Area Pass at Yen 4,520.00 at Asakusa too late to book online or too early to buy from the office in Asakusa. There's a JR direct train from Ikebukuro to Nikko but one way is Yen3,800. We wanted to go by the cheapest way. That's why we ended going the long long way by local trains. Next day 6.30am we took the train from Ikebukuro station to Akabane. From Akabane to Utsunomiya Station. From Utsunomiya to Nikko station. Finally we arrive at 9.15am I think. Then bought a Yen2,000 return ticket to Chuzenji Onsen.
The road up to Chuzenji Onsen was really winding and have many sharp turns. The bus driver was a real expert slow and steady and I didn't throw up my breakfast.
Anyway around 40 minutes or more we reach the bus stop and walked to the Kegon waterfall.
Spectacular. Wished I could swim in the water at the bottom of the falls. So blue the water!
After the falls, we walked towards Chuzenji lake.
On the way there we ate soft ice cream and had a piece of cheese cake. Just spent less than an hour. Took the bus back to Toshu-go Shrine. A bit of walk up the hill and on the dot noon we reach the walkway entrance to the shrine. We could hear church bells ringing and at the same time the temple gong sounded. It felt really strange hearing this two together like they were talking to each other. The bells kept ringing and the gong kept going a few time. It was mesmerizing watching that person pulling and releasing the tree trunk I think to hit the gong. I don't know if they do this everyday at noon. But try getting there at noon maybe you get to experience this special moment.
Anyway the reason we came to Nikko was of course to see the famous shrine. Really crowded. Hordes of people crowding around the 3 wise monkeys trying to take the best pictures. Really beautiful. Every nook and corners of the shrine you can see amazing delicate cravings. But I feel the best part was the huge and majestic cedar trees lining the walk up to the bronze urn of the Shogun Leyasu
remains. Well worth the long hours spent on the train visiting this magnificent place.
Sorry for the long winded report cos I just could not get over how beautiful the place is and how long the return journey back was by local train.
Warning: not for those with weak necks cos there's no head rest all the way. And you could be standing some parts of the journey.
Plan early and cheaper to buy the pass of course. Even our cheap journey cost us around
Yen7,200 per person return.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Interesting, but optional","After reading so many reviews with good recommendations, my wife and I included a day in Nikko to visit the temples and walk around for while. At the station we took a taxi to the Tōshō-gū Shrine with a friendly driver for less than 1.000 yen. The temples are ok, but the recent restoration took the ""old-riginality"" of most carvings, paintings and buildings. It looks too fresh. There are many interesting wood carvings and paintings to be found at the different shrine the most photographed ones are the wise monkeys and Nemuri Neko or the sleeping cat but there are others such as the crying dragon and the imagined elephant.
After walking around for while we've decided to walk back to the city. On the way we've stopped at a nice small restaurant, sorry, I do not remember the name.
It was nice day, but not exceptional, go there if you have a day to spare.","Written June 23, 2017"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A glimpse inside the Japanese heart,"This shrine is a exquisite work of architecture and not to be missed because of its beauty, location and history. It is one of the most original shines in Japan...virtually the same as when it was built. The details of the temple are incredible with thousands of tiny carvings and reliefs. Most impressive is the reverence that the Japanese hold for this site...you FEEL the connection they have to their history here. The shrine plaza is surrounded by ancient giant fir trees (I think) which are reminiscent of the sequoias we know so well in the Sierra Nevada of California. If you take a cab they will deliver you right to the shrine and it's a relatively easy walk up from there. Simply a stunning and very meaningful place, even for casual visitors.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Very busy on the weekend which somewhat ruined the experience.,Fantastic location and area but we just picked the wrong day when it was extremely busy and probably the busiest time (around lunchtime).

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Remember where the bus parked,"When you disembark the bus you will follow a path through a wooded area before entering the shrine. At this point stay focused and look for a landmark where to make your turn when you exit. When you enter, the guide will inform you that you will view the shrine at your own pace (see the photos below). When you exit through the tall wooden torii gate you will see a few paths that go through wooded areas to different lots and they all look similar. Remember the landmark when you entered. It rained steady when I was there, looking at others photos it seems the same held true, so be prepared.",

Considered cutting the day short as we couldn't see much of interest. Decided to walk up to the top of the hill and came across a beautiful red bridge and crossed the road to see what was up the stone path... Awesome is how I'd describe the rest of the day. No crowds and the most lovely and interesting collection of shrines we'd seen. And i had been feeling a bit templed-out by this time.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Awesome!,"During our planning for this trip to Japan, we did not include Nikko Toshogu Shrine until a friend told us about it. We decided to do a day trip from Tokyo and we were glad we did although it was 2-hours away by shinkansen, a change of train at Utsunomiya and a bus ride from the station to the shrine.

Toshogu Shrine was simply awesome. There was so much to see including the famed ""see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil"" monkeys on the facade of a building, the sleeping cat...the list goes on. What was really amazing was this room where you hear the ""crying dragon"". The priest hit two sticks together and only at a certain spot in the room, the sound echoed like a someone in grief. Anywhere out of this spot, you hear the sound of two sticks being struck together.

If you are making a day trip from Tokyo, you may want to either take a heavy breakfast or have lunch before heading for the shrine because there is no cafe or restaurant there. We didn't know that so we had a late lunch at Utsunomiya where we had to change train back to Tokyo. But it was a blessing in disguise because Utsunomiya is famous for its gyoza. We ate at the famed Higashiguch Utsunomiya. It is a small pink standalone building with large windows across the road from the station. You may want to try the inexpensive gyozas too.

We had no trouble with crowds and were able to see most of the park in 4 hours although I think it is best to view it in a leisurely day walk. The main building is still under reconstruction and is totally covered with an outside shell. That said, they have done a great job allowing visitors inside to see the renovation in process. Much has already been completed and they have shown the details of the renovation in displays and view of the actual work. They started in 2006 with plans to finish in 2020 so almost finished.

The God stables with the monkey carvings were enchanting and fun to see the original ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" monkeys who are the guardians of horses. The various gates have magnificent statues, brilliantly colored, guarding the entrances.

There is no reason to book an expensive ""tour"" to see this site as it is easy to get to on JR line and with a Lonely Planet or Eyewitness travel guide, you can do it yourself at your own pace.","Written May 18, 2017"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Renovated,"The shrine and nearly all buildings at the site have been extensively renovated. They now shine and glitter in gold and vibrant colours. Whilst this shows them off in all their glory, we felt it also took away some of the ""historic feel"" - they may as well be in plastic, rather than what they are, beautifully carved timber.
The day we went, the site was packed and there were long queues all over the place. It's a little hard to enjoy the serenity when surrounded by thousands, all clicking their cameras frantically.
I don't know if this is a permanent display, but on the day there was a exquisite collection of bonsai trees on show. Combination of these trees with the backdrop of the shrine make for great pictures.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Best Temple visit,"On our 3rd tour of Japan, we have visited many shrines and temples, but this is our favorite. Still undergoing renovation and very crowded, the statues, carvings, ceilings et al are spectacular, all set in a lovely old cedar forest. The only downside is the number of stone steps to climb to reach all levels - but well worth the effort.","Written April 27, 2017"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Wow- highlight of visiting Japan,"Yes, it is worth a day trip from Tokyo! The bullet train takes you to the transfer station and the signs are well marked, you can do this.

The tourist information office in Nikko will set you up with a bus ticket, there is loop through town so you ride for 10 minutes to the temple complex.

The whole temple complex was impressive! The scale, level of detail and colors- wow!
The pagoda is right in front of Tosho-gu (main complex), Taiyun-in (buddist temple) and Shinkyo bridge are unique and you won't forget them. The pictures do not do this place justice- I mean it! It was not crowded and very peaceful.
I went in the winter while it was snowing and it was incredible- like a movie.
Just go and spend the day- the temple close at 4pm and you don't want to miss out.
There is a reason this is a Unesco heritage site.","Written April 26, 2017"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing but still some parts were under repairment,"It was not my first time to visit Nikko Tosho-gu, but it was great to visit this shrine again.
This time, I got the explanation kit to know the detail of things which gave us a lot of information. If you climb up the mountain, it might be good but to steep for aged people.
Beautiful and very different ones from Kyoto, Kamakura or other city in Japan.

We went there by Special Express train of Tobu Asakusa line. Got off at Nikko Station.
You can take one day bus ticket and the bus brought us near Tosho-gu.

April was the very good season, because you can also see some cherry blossoms there.","Written April 26, 2017"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Fabulous,Arrived in March with our guide being ecstatic that the gate which had been covered for restoration work for 4 years was now uncovered. Also we had the added bonus of an overnight downfall of snow. What an atmosphere with the walk up to the Shrine through all the trees. Didn't know much about the shrine but so worth the 2 hour journey to get to it. The town also looked interesting but we didn't have time to explore sadly,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Big Shrine,"When we arrived at the main gate of Nikko Tosho-gu, we were greeted by five stories pagoda which was claimed to have the same height as the Tokyo Skytree Tower. We needs to pay an entrance fee if I'm not mistaken is about 1.200 yen. It's actually expensive compared to other common entrance fee of a shrine. But as expected, it was expensive because the place was spacious. The ornaments on the wall were impressive. You need to take a lot of steps to reach the top. As good as it is, for me I don't find there was much to do or see inside.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Extraordinary - and very impressive,"Travelers to Japan should visit this site. You can feel the atmosphere from the old days, and you would almost expect to see samurais around the corners. Don't miss out the trip to the Nikko Shrines",

Although most buildings are no longer here, I feel the castle area is worth a visit. The walls are still in tact as are some structures. It will be many years before the project is complete. This castle has burnt down many times and has rebuilt so it will be fascinating again once it's up and running. You can still walk the grounds although a lot of places are currently blocked off. There are a lot of historic markers worth reading, I learned a lot. After visiting the castle, I walked the park across from it and explored the surrounding area.

Again you must visit Shurijo castle while In Okinawa.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Nothing much to see as the main area was burnt down,"The main part of the castle was burnt down in a fire last year, and it will probably take some time before everything is back up again. For now, it was mainly the outer walls which are available for viewing and the garden area within the castle. Nothing really much to experience, but at least it was completely free at the moment. Not many signage or brochures to explain about the fire or history of the place, which was a let-down.

The castle restaurant was open, and provided pretty good value for money food, although the food wasn’t anything to wow at. Service was pretty fast, and food was quickly served almost instantaneously after ordering.","Written March 7, 2020"

Japan,Shurijo Castle,After the Fire,"Shuri Castle in Shuri, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Between 1429 and 1879, it was the palace of the Ryukyu Kingdom, before becoming largely neglected. In 1945, during the Battle of Okinawa, it was almost completely destroyed. After the war, the castle was re-purposed as a university campus. Beginning in 1992, the central citadel and walls were largely reconstructed on the original site based on historical records, photographs, and memory. On the morning of 31 October 2019, the main courtyard structures of the castle were again destroyed in a fire. We saw the castle in a ruined state but hopefully when restored, I will see it at it's beauty.",

Japan,Shurijo Castle,I hope it can be rebuilt soon,I hope Japanese government is able to get this place rebuilt soon. It is really sad to see this place being destroyed like this.,
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Most Parts Open & Free. Go visit.,"It's 110% worthwhile to visit the castle ground now, although the main castle is burned down. It was painful to see the damage, but in a big picture, this is one example of how history evolves. I believe it was meaningful for our kids to see the site as well.

It's completely free (though you do need to pay parking, if you are driving), and all the shops and the restaurant are open.

From a purely logistic standpoint, you have less crowd to fight through. There usually is a line to get dressed in the traditional Okinawan costume to get your picture taken at Shurei Mon (the famous gate that appears on 2000 yen bills), but there was no line when we visited. I think the cost was about 1000 yen per person, if I remember correctly. Shurei Mon is located at the beginning of the route, away from the fire-damaged area. Also, you actually get to appreciate the rest of the castle ground (greens, gates, etc) better.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,An amazing castle,"We were told this was a must do on our list of places to go in my husbands heritage country and we were not disappointed!
This is an amazing castle with an extraordinary story. There is so much culture and history in this place. We thought it was so crazy that they rebuilt this castle twice after fires destroyed it and they have clear floors in certain areas to show the remains.
After returning home to the states a week later, we learned that it burned down again. This brought tears to our eyes! So glad we got to see it and hope they rebuild it again!",

But what’s left is broken tiles, burned timbers, and ashes. I cried.
I visited Shurijo Castle 30 years ago, just after it was reopened following a major restoration. This year, it was again being refurbished and restored when the fire occurred.

What a lost to the world community. But I know that it will be restored once again for the third or fourth time during it's existance. I visited it in the 1960'sm the 1980's and finally in 2002 with my wife. Ever time I visited the Castle it had had some improvements made to it. Over time there were many historic artifacts included in the restoration. Some will be able to be replaced or duplicated due to the many pictures of the Castle that exist. And thank god that there are other artifacts in the many museums around the island. It will take many years to get it back to what it looked like in 2002 when I last visited. I was a student of Dr. Barbara Golden, who received her PHd in the history of the Ryukyuian island culture by the University of the Ryukyus. Many of the things she discovered over the 35+ years on the islands, were either kept in the Castle, at the University of the Ryukyus, or in one of the many museums affiliated with the University. She was the author of several Japanese books on the history and on the different cultures in the Ryukyuian chain of islands. One of her books, I believe was on the 27 different castles on Okinawa when there were 27 kingdoms there. I would like to visit the castle one more time before I die.","Written December 16, 2019"

Limited information is provided but it is enough. There is a good amount of stairs involved to see everything. You can also walk the ramparts. At the main gate, you can dress up in traditional costumes for a fee and get your photo taken. After you are done, take the short walk to the family mausoleum. It is a separate smaller fee and takes about 15 minutes to see. Watch you head 😁",

The non pain areas still have some interesting things to look at and lots of information signs in different languages. The paid section was 830yen and the signs stated that there was a discount if you had a monorail day pass. The restored castle is partly a museum with real and reproduced relics. You get to walk inside the restored wooden castle where they have installed modern elements such as wheelchair lifts and handrails. In typical Japanese style there is a stamp rally throughout the castle and if you complete all the stamps, you collect a small gift. Overall it was a beautiful castle with a great view from the wall. Although it's not an authentic experience it was still quite interesting.",

It was just a fun way to ensure we do not miss out any site. We took 2.5 hours including lunch at the tourist center, there is a restaurant on level 2.
It is historical journey. So read up before you visit.

We had a picnic at a rest stop. There is a sheltered area with beverage vending machines. We had wanted to sit by the pond but due to rain, we decided to just have the picnic under this sheltered rest stop.It was fun.

There is a banner and a poster outside the office. The castle grounds are huge and it's really too hot to walk outside for too long today.

We took bus 9 from Naha Station or you could also take the monorail and alight at Shuri Station. There is entrance ticket that costs about 870 Yen and it is very worth it. It is perfect to visit the castle just before the sunset for a perfect viewing and sunset photo. The main entrance stands Shureimon Gate that leads to the castle park. As you walk by to your right passing the Gusuku (fortress) stands at the top of the hill is the castle's main hall or Seiden. The Una Plaza stands in front of the seiden which serves as ceremonial hall. Inside the castle you could view the main throne and several rooms which truly embodies its Ryukyuan interior design. Outside as you walk there is the observatory called Iri No Azana, which has a 360 degree view of Naha and bird's eye view of the castle complex which is truly amazing and beautiful. Here we took the best sunset shots and videos which are truly remarkable. It is also not that very high to climb up perhaps around 20 to 30 steps only. The castle at sunset is truly historical and romantic and it is not very crowded with tourists.

Let me explain. Upon entering the castle proper via the “usual route” (Tip for you fellas out there- don’t make the joke that ‘this is how I refer to you as sometimes honey’ to your wife- she will not talk to for hours) you are asked to take your shoes off and keep them with you in a plastic bag. You go about the beautiful red, adorned and tatami strewn castle which houses an enormous throne which the missus and I hypothesize was needed as most of the Ryuku emperors were probably as obese as Mr. Kinjo (Okinawans and travelers will understand) and then at the end you put your shoes back on and hand the plastic bag to a man who straightens the bag out for cleaning and then reuse. HE MUST BE THE ONLY MAN ON THE PLANET THAT USES ATHLETE’S FOOT ON HIS HANDS!

Japan,Shurijo Castle,looked great,"went here as part of a shore tour, the castle looked great and seemed to have lots of interesting things to look at the grounds and gardens also looked very interesting. unfortunately we were only allowed a very limited time here so seemed to be rushed through with no time to stop and look. there were some steep steps to access the main area and you are required to remove your shoes in one of the areas. Personally think it would be a great place to visit and send the day, but for us unfortunately that was not allowed.",

You will have to take off shoes for castle visit (plastic bags provided) so I advice you to have socks if you do not feel comfortable “sharing” floor with bare feet.

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Fun,"Well maintained historical and cultural site.

Very organised and clearly marked route so you can see all that is on offer.

The ‘Stamp Rally’ where you take a stamp sheet and use an ink stamp to stamp landmarks along the route is a genius way to get kids (and adults!) engaged and motivated during the sight seeing. Get all stamps to receive cute stickers and a mini folder at the end.

Much of the outer grounds is free, and the inside of the buildings require an entrance fee (¥800). Good views of the city.

The tea set in the building was a lovely break. For ¥310 you get jasmine tea and 4 imperial cookies, served in the tatami room where the prince used to entertain diplomats and guests. The staff are dressed in red kimonos and explain the snacks.

Being an European, our castles are something completely different and this was like a refreshing breeze. The castle itself did not have too many old items but it was more like the building itself where the tour focused.
We visited the castle on a sunny day and as some areas are outdoors, this was the right day. The only minor disadvantage were big tourist groups as sometimes it felt there was too much people.

We could see meticulous work done to restore the castle which was damaged in battle of Okinawa. It may take 1-2 hours. Great place to visit!!,
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Replica But Still Interesting,We visited this beautiful castle and grounds and pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and layout of the castle. The original castle was destroyed by the U.S. during WW2 when the Japanese were headquartered here. Only the walls remained.

There’s a nice tea set that you could enjoy in the castle itself. Do try that if you had the chance, nice experience!",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,On your own from Naha cruise port,"If you are sufficiently confident to travel a few stops on the monorail and enjoy plenty walking, you can spend a lovely few hours seeing this area and visiting the castle on your own. We had originally booked a ship tour which was cancelled and so at fairly short notice decided to sort something ourselves.

The attached map photo shows the port (circled in pink) and the monorail line which travels via Furujima and on to Shurijo.

We disembarked the ship first thing and walked directly up to the monorail station, Kencho-Mae, crossing 2 or 3 road junctions (bottom left box). We purchased a day pass (inexpensive) and on arrival at Shurijo station, followed the directions to the castle, which obviously includes some uphill. We felt that this castle was sufficiently different to others seen on our cruise/tour to be worthwhile. If you can get there early (before the tour buses) it is rather nice and whilst in reality there was little to see inside, some artefacts and history (no photography allowed), the main Hall was certainly photogenic from outside. Nominal fee for entry.

We then walked back to the monorail and disembarked at an earlier stop, for Makishi, enabling us to experience the market and surrounding streets. The fish market was very interesting, as were some of the pottery stalls and the expensive liqueur with a viper in the jar! We stopped for coffee at the black sugar stall and continued this route back to the ship. Enroute and very close the ship is also the Naminoue Shrine and gardens and understand from others who didn’t venture too far on their own, that these were also very pleasant.
Enough to see and do here for a few hours and has a different feel to other Japanese ports.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,A disappointment!,"I think I built up my expectations of the castle because the surrounding park area is so very beautiful. As we entered the paid part of the museum (Y820) we removed our shoes and put them in the plastic bag they handed us at the door. The castle has been totally renovated and is, for the most part, barren of any kind of furniture other than a throne. There was a display of stringed instruments and a very few decorative paintings, but other than that there was little to see on our self-guided walk. On my next visit I will save my entrance fee and just absorb the beauty of the surrounding park grounds.","Written March 27, 2019"
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Colourful and stylish 'Seiden'!,"Whilst there are many free-to-view cultural assets to see on the climb up to Shurijo Castle, entry to the 'Paid Admission Zone' of the Castle itself costs Y820. If you travelled to Shuri on the Monorail using a 1-Day or 2-Day Pass, you can get a significant reduction (c. 20%) to Y660, on production of the Pass. Entry to this Zone gives you access to the red and white paved quadrangle where you can view the colourful and stylish 'Seiden' - the centrepiece of the Shurijo Castle structures, and to a self-guided tour internally of the rooms.
Dating back to the 14th Century, the brilliant colours and distinctive Ryukyuan architecture shows both Chinese and Japanese influences. Left in ruins after the Battle of Okinawa, the Castle was totally rebuilt/restored based on an 18th Century model. As much as I admired the vermillion and gilded opulence and polished wood interiors, there are some 'cons', including;
- even on a dull and overcast mid-week January day, the #1 attraction in Naha seems to attracts hordes of visitors,
- as a senior travelling solo, I tend rely on my camera to record my travels and the enforcement of 'no photography' rules (internally) denies me of these memories.
Notwithstanding these, .... Would I go back again on a future visit? I certainly would!",

You get to see an Okinawan garden and for an additional price of ¥300 you can try tea with a treat. With the free map you could also go on a fun stamp hunt. Definitely a must visit.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Parking very difficult,"If you manage to find parking at the main entrance , walk to entry of castle is about 100m . Otherwise if the carparks were full ( we reached around 330 pm) then you have to park behind the castle in the many little carpark scattered all around . We paid 500 yen for two hours parking at a private residence .
What is worse , to access the castle, we had to walk about 100m up a steep slope , then 100m on flat ground , then skirted the castle wall walking up and down stairs. By the time we reached the exit point of the attraction , we were all winded . You had to walk another 100 m on flat ground to get to the entrance .
To me , if there is no parking at the front of the castle , forget about this attraction or go another time especially if you have strollers and elderly with you.","Written March 13, 2019"

It’ll cost you 820¥ to enter to the castle to learn more historical information. But you will need to read the information yourself, else you can always hire a guide to do the job for u.
The map of the castle can be collected at the ticketing counter. Through the map, you should covered all the main stations, places u need to see, to know about the castle. On top of it, you will collect a castle souvenir; which is a sticker & a paper folder once u’ve collected all the 25 + 3 stamps at stops number 25.

Free entry to the park/grounds but had to pay 800 Y to enter the castle. Free for disabled and one companion. It was very crowded inside the castle. Felt like a herd of cattle being pushed through the line but glad we got in at least to see the throne. Very Chinese, if you ask me. Wish we had more time there to see the rest of the park. Hopefully, will return someday.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Reconstructed History,"The original Castle was completely destroyed during WWII. What we see today is a reconstruction based on photographs and available plans.

Getting to the Castle area is no easy task as you must walk an uphill path and a number of stairs. This is the Path to the Seiden where you will see a number of gates. The wheelchair path misses the sites along the path.

The Museum tour is basically self guided. You must remove your shoes (you are given a bag to carry them) to walk through the halls. As my wife has orthopedic boots she declined the tour. Walking on bare feet would be too painful. The Ryukyu exhibits were somewhat on the sparse side. The staff were all dressed in period costume.

There is no air conditioning inside the museum and it was very hot. There are free hand fans to keep cool. During our visit there were large crowds. The tour finishes on the second floor. We spent the last 15 minutes in a mass crowd as we funneled onto a staircase and the exit where people are putting their footwear back on. Staff collect the bags for recycling.",

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Beautiful surroundings!,"Shurijo Castle is about 20mins away from Kokusai Street. We decided to take a taxi instead since it was not very convenient go there by public transport. The entire compound is quite huge. If you are keen to participate in the stamp rally (where you can get a souvenir if you complete a number of stations), I would recommend at least 1.5 hours. We managed to get a sticker souvenir for completing the minimum number of stations. The castle was partially under renovation as at Nov 2018.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,It’s a beautiful walk to the castle,"Better than I expected. We were late and missed their last performance at 4pm. The walk into the park is free unless you want to enter inside the castle.

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Wonderful site and guide,"This is a must see place for sure, we were lucky to have a really good guide who spoke perfect English and had a clear understanding of the history of the site. One thing to remember is wear easy to remove shoes as you need to take your shoes off to enter the Castle site. Although so much is reconstructed there are a few areas that have original foundations these can be seen through a glass viewing point. Staff in the area are dress in national costumes and they were happy to stand and pose for photographs with guests of on their own. There is a peaceful calm around the place until you get into the gift shop which is bustling, here you can use US dollars as well as Yen to make your purchases. There is a nice walk through to the castle and well worth a couple of hours. Suitable for people of all ages as there is so much to see.",

Japan,Shurijo Castle,It is worth the time and the climb to visit,"I took my public transportation there. As a tip the castle is situated on top of a hill. We took a taxi there but walked down hill to Gibo station after the visit. A climb uphill would have been very challenging.

A large section of the attraction is free. And there is a game to collect stamps at different parts of the castle. This is very useful to get my son to walk around with us as he wants to collect all the stamps.

I really like the staff at the attraction. Really tried to be helpful.

Although the original castle is destroyed they try as much as possible to restore it using historical records.

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Untimely Visit,"Castle frontage was undergoing repair works. Knew about it after paying the 820Yen entrance fees and going into the castle grounds. Otherwise, it was about a 30mins tour. Tick in the box!",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,A place to hang out when you have extra time,"Stayed at Naha for 2 to 3 days before I headed to north, this place seems worth to go when I looked up in the internet where to go in Naha.
Anyway, if you are not into history this is not your cup of tea. The garden and view are ok but I would not say amazing.
But they do have a trick to attract people (in Japan culture), it is the stamp collection. For each signature spots or places they want you to visit (a bit like ikea, try to guide you to walk through the place), there has stamp station for you to stamp onto the leaflet and you can collect all or not (can have souvenir). And I quite obsessed into collect things personally so I sucked into it, and spent 1 to 2 hours to walk around to collect all.
They also has pay and free areas, pay area I would say not much to see tbh. I don't recommend that but you are like me, want to collect all stamps then you need to pay money to go in.
can get discount (JPY820 originally) if you show 1 or 2 days monorail pass.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Do the scavenger hunt for stamps!,"We arrived here by car and were immediately guided to our parking spot by multiple traffic attendants. As soon as you go up via the escalators, you enter the park. The building where you exit has multiple information desks and stands where you could get your information and pamphlet for the scavenger hunt for stamps. When you've completed the scavenger hunt, you'll even get extra free stickers as reward.

Surprised by this little activity, we scoured the area. The park was well maintained, and we particularly enjoyed the view from the observation deck. As we got something to drink from the machine in one of the little houses, a nice lady also informed us that ""in two minutes"" a performance would start at the outside of the area, and it would be nice for us to see. She was right, and we enjoyed the two traditional dances performed by people in traditional costume and make-up.
After the dance we entered the castle, where we were welcomed by a large but tidy courtyard. Unfortunately the front side of the castle was under restoration, but they did put a banner with a picture of the castle (which was quite humorous to me). On the inside, we had to take off our shoes (they provided us with a plastic bag) and toured the many historical goods. Further into the castle, we even had tea and snacks in the tea area. This was particularly enjoyable, as you had a fantastic view on the back garden while snacking on some nice sweets with Jasmin tea. After the tea, we continued scouring the castle and visited the grounds. In the park there was additionally a visitor questionnaire, where we were asked to answer a few questions in return for a post card of the castle. This showed me the were continuously working on improving the castle grounds on accessibility and guidance for visitors.","Written November 14, 2018"

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Lovely replica,"The route is from the Mashiki Station.
Take the monorail to Shuri station or you can also go to Gibo Station as well (the stop before Shuri and might be easier to get to the castle from Gibo). Which is a twelve minute monorail ride. From Gibo station you head straight south for around a ten to fifteen minute walk. From Shuri station it will be just a little longer and you have to head south/ west. Also harder to get to the castle, because the streets to get there, is more difficult. Also Google maps was having a problem on the route to getting us there.

When you get to your destination, there will be a few vendors selling ice cream and other trinkets, on the grounds. This is in the middle of the observation area on one side, and a pathway on the other, which takes you to the castle.
Check out the observation area first. Really great views and you can even get a nice selfie, with Shurijo Castle in your background.

It costs you maybe ten to twelve dollars to get into the castle grounds and the castle.
The grounds are immaculate, the architecture is incredible, and it is such a great place to see a part of history.

If you like castles and you're in Naha, then you should check this place out.
Very great experience and I enjoyed it very much.",

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Worth the walk,"Having visited castles in many countries, this one was a little unexpected to see at first as it was not unlike the buildings we saw in Beijings forbidden city. Yes there are huge walls around it, and it can be a bit of an uphill climb with all those steps through the various gates, but it does have a lot to offer you in Japanese style architecture.
Sadly the original building was blown to bits during WW2, but they have done a fabulous job of recreating the original. Except on our visit, they were still doing a bit of construction work, so maybe the outside was not at its best.
Then it was off with the shoes as we padded through various levels of what a life would have been like in the Seiden .Lots of artwork to see, but photography on some levels is not allowed. However the throne room of the Ryukyu royal family is allowed, and it is impressive with a massive throne on display fit for a king- which it was originally. The rest of the rooms seem a little spartan by modern standards.
There are other buildings to see , but rain did not help us much that day. There is a gift shop in the adjoining Hokuden building (and toilets too) and some exhibitions of local history.

We were only about a 5-10 minute drive away from our hotel. Finding reasonably priced parking in the area is a bit tricky. From memory it was about 500 yen for about 60 minutes or something and then you add on more per hour.

Japan,Shurijo Castle,An excellent reproduction,"With architectural influences of both China and Japan, this Castle shows its cultural and historical values in its stonework and architectural design, Shurijo was designated as a World Heritage Site in December of 2000, the 11th World Heritage Site within Japan. The Castle served as the centre of Ryukyu Kingdom and its politics, foreign affairs and culture. Okinawa was an independent country, before being annexed by Japan in 1879. Recent World War 2 history saw the castle and just about everything on Okinawa blown to hell and over two thirds of its population wiped out. Every building in Okinawa is new. This castle is an amazing reproduction. A visit to the castle teaches about the kingdom and the Kings who governed it during a particular period of history. Entry cost is reasonable, as it has been made a world heritage site. You will need to remove your shoes and carry them in a bag, while you walk through the reconstructed interior parts of the castle. This will preserve the wooden surfaces for future generations. I loved the battlements and seeing their layout and the fact that the castle is built on the top of a steep hill, shows the invincability of the Kingdom. A visit is highly recommended.",

We caught the monorail from the shuttle bus drop off point, (a day pass for the monorail was Y800) and the castle was at the final stop. There was very little signposting but we could see where we were heading and we eventually found our way although it took us about 15 to 20 minutes.

The outer parts of the castle and the grounds are free to enter; there is a gift shop, small restaurant and public toilets adjacent to the car park. The toilets are western type (thank goodness!) with extra buttons for douche, dry and music - very civilised!!

We climbed upwards to the main part of the castle, it was a steep path with some steps but there was a disabled access available. We paid Y660 entry fee for the castle which was a one way circuit around the exhibits and included videos, reconstructed rooms and some models.There was also a Japanese tea room and we had unlimited jasmine tea with 5 small cakes for Y300. We sat at a communal table and one of the waitresses gave a talk about the food and drink we were enjoying - there was an English translation in the menu which was a great help!

You have to remove your shoes before entering the castle, just as you would in any Japanese home so its a good idea to either take slippers or wear socks - I had to pad around in my bare feet and felt a bit uncomfortable. There are lockers for your shoes and other belongings in the tea house, otherwise you just carry your shoes around with you in the provided plastic bag. The castle gardens are worth a visit too, with lots of fruit trees

This was a great experience, we were there for almost 3 hours and had an excellent time!",

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Enjoyable Place to Visit,"Shuri Castle is enjoyable to visit. The old stone walls and temples around the castle are particularly photogenic. The castle itself has been heavily restored. There is currently scaffolding around the main hall. It has a distinctive red paint job that does not make it look authentic. Inside there are replicas of the bowls and armour used in the old times.
The grounds are well kept. It is worthwhile getting the stamp map and going around collecting all of the stamps. Kids and some adults will love it. 800 JPY for an adult to enter. There are toilets and plenty of vending machines with water because it can be quite exhausting walking around in the heat. The castle is also easily accessible by wheelchair.
While it isn't as grand as many other forts in the world, Shuri Castle is certainly worth spending a couple of hours wandering around.","Written June 8, 2018"

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Did not live up to expectations,"I was extremely excited about visiting Shuri Castle. It's in Japan, but used to belong to a royal family that presided over its own independent kingdom (Ryukyu), so it felt like I was going somewhere really ancient and unique.
But it's not ancient, not really. Because the castle is a reconstruction and this was the feeling you got when you went inside the main hall.

I found the exterior relatively impressive (the architecture resembles Chinese architecture). The red striped courtyard is a sight to see, but I imagine I would have been more wowed had there not been a mass of scaffolding over the main hall that substituted for this by hanging up a large print of what you could no longer see behind it.
I may as well have been looking at a picture online. Although actually, I blame the online pictures for my disappointing experience because they make it look so spectacular.

Inside, you could see a reconstruction of the old Ryukyuan King's throne, amongst other reconstructed artefacts and an exhibition of some legitimate heritage items. Only trouble is, my enthusiasm for such things had dulled because I was so let down by the unexpected scaffolding.

I'll admit, there were some other factors not related to the castle that coloured my enjoyment of it. For one, I'd travelled to Okinawa in June, but it was the rainy season so although it was hot it was tipping down so I was walking around the castle getting drenched (didn't do the gardens because of this).
Also, I'd mistakenly imagined the castle would be in a beautiful setting a stone's throw from the beach. This is the impression you get when you see pictures in guide books and such. But it was in the middle of the UGLIEST CITY IN THE ENTIRE WORLD - Naha.

Entrance fee: 860 yen (tad overpriced). I noticed some accessible areas, but in order to get in to the place I had to go up some steep stairs so not sure about that.
We drove there. Wasn't difficult navigating the roads.","Written June 3, 2018"

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Attractive reconstructed castle,"The castle has been extensively reconstructed after being pretty much destroyed during the war.

Of course it is still well worth a visit, although I didn't bother paying to go into the inner sanctum since that didn't look very authentic at all.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Nothing original .....,"Shurijo castle is definitely worth a visit. It's very sad that hardly any part of it is original, it was all destroyed by the Americans in 1945. It has however been beautifully restored and much of it is quite recent. It costs 820Ypp for entry and the ticket booth is quite a distance inside the gate so don't think you've missed it just keep walking. The grounds are also beautiful to walk through and you can see old tunnels and a beautiful bridge over the lake.",

The temporary exhibition featured treasures of the kings and was very interesting as well. We almost missed it, as it is in the hosting chambers, the tea room where one can pay for a tea & cookies set. The 4 different cookies follow ancient recipes and the tea can be refilled by the nice staff. A great break from the heat as well, overlooking the Zen garden. Do plan 2-3 hours if you include the castle tour, as well as the gardens.",

After exploring the castle buildings you can take a walk outside to view the castle walls and external gardens. There are some steps and slopes to navigate along the way but nothing too steep.

A pleasant way to spend the morning (2 hours or so) visiting one of Okinawa's main attractions.

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Need more signage,"We probably followed the signage for cars and walked a longer route to get to the castle. We walked to Ryutan-dori from the monorail station. From there, we walked along route 29 and 49 to the main access way (Samukawa-dori) to Shurijo Castle, passing blue seal ice cream, Lawson convenience store and Ryutan (dragon pond) on our way. Based on google map, it was a 1.4 km walk. We would have shortened the walk by 300m if we turned left after Lawson. But it was late March, the weather was nice and there were lots of blooming flowers along the way, the longer walk wasn't strenuous at all.

On entering Samukawa-dori, you will pass by a little house on your right which has a resting place, lockers, toilets and a souvenir shop. We would have missed this place if we took the left turn at Lawson. This place also distributes a stamping pamphlet where fans can affix location ink stamps to the pamphlet when you reach various locations in Shurijo Castle.

We reached Shurijo Castle at 10 am+ then slowly toured the castle compound. Access is free until you reach the square inside Koufukumon (廣福門). The suggested route is to take the stairs from Kankaimon (歓會門) to Koufukumon (廣福門), tour the castle and indoor exhibits (purchase the entrance tickets at the counter near Koufukumon (廣福門)), then exit via the slope from the square inside Koufukumon (廣福門) to Kobikimon (木曳門).

The displays are in Japanese, Chinese and English (I think Korean, too) and are well written giving the viewer a feel for what life was like during the castle’s heyday in Ryukyuan culture.

If you don't want to walk, there are buses #7 and 8 which can take you near to the gate (didn't spot anyone waiting though). Entry ticket is ¥820 for adult, there is discount for kids and seniors. It is required to take off your shoes when visiting the palace and the adjacent halls. There is a set visiting path that you have to follow.

There are many gates and buildings to see here, plus they have a stamp collecting game, which is fun and it makes you to see every remarkable spot without missing any of them. It was a bit crowded though.",

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Any visit to Okinawa should include a trip to Shuri Jo and the surroundings,"The castle is in the midst of some renovations so the front is obscured by scaffolding as of Oct 2017. That said it will look fantastic once the laquer has been applied.
The tour is well worth the price and will greatly enhance most peoples knowledge of Okinawan history.
Remember, the castle (jo) was destroyed in WWII so this is a very faithful recreation of what the castle looked like. They are careful to point out the original parts that you can still see.
I highly recommend a walk down the ""stone tatami"" path and eating at the restuarant you find on your right at the end of the path.","Written February 4, 2018"
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Great and magnificent,"Compared to Nakijin Castle, it was a Castle that is intact with much restoration done to it. The size of the Castle is really amazing and grand.

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Met Expectations,"As I'm only in Okinawa for 2 weeks, I picked 4 things I wanted to do - this was at the top of my list. I went over the weekend, and it was exactly what I thought it was going to be ... a castle! Lol. The entrance fee is 800JPY, which I was not expecting. You need to pay this in order to go through the gates to see the castle. Once through the gates, you will see the castle and a museum entrance to your right. This museum entrance walks you through the castle and has things such as portraits of previous Emperors. Some areas you are not able to take photos of, but most areas, you are. If you are expecting to see a castle and a piece of history, you will be satisfied (I was!).",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Nice Park for a Stroll and Pictures,"Located at the end of the monorail station about 15 minutes walk away. Expect to climb some stairs and slopes. The views up the top were quite nice.

The park is clean and expect tour groups there so can be a little noisy. Usually a Mandarin speaking tour guide will lead Chinese visitors there. You may even be able to stand around to listen about the park and the castle.

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Ancient castle wall and refined palace,The palace building was mainly rebuilt according to the original design which was destroyed years ago because these buildings was mainly built by woods. Inside the building there’s a historic museum to tell the history of Okinawa and some old things to see. Outside the garden there’s old stone walls that gives you the historic feeling. It took 2 to 3 hours to view the whole area and it is a must-go place for the travelers who want to add some historic part in their trip in Okinawa.,
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Nothing special,"Well, it's the place not to be missed when you are in Naha, but don't expect to be astonished with the scene. Positive things are that there is the great view of the city and performance you could see there. Can be boring for the kids.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Might be Boring for Kids,"I'm glad we went. It was a nice day to stroll around and I can say I've been, but I wouldn't go again and I think most kids will be bored.

Our favorite part of the site was exploring the grounds in search of stamp pads to stamp a souvenir map. If you collect all the stamps, you receive a nice gift of a small plastic folder, stickers, a coloring book, and a special stamp.

Upon reaching the paid, museum area, you are handed a plastic bag to carry your shoes. You tour the castle and museum in your bare feet.

As others have commented, the castle just has a lot of empty rooms that look alike, limited captions, and not much else.

There's an inexpensive cafe where we enjoyed a corn dog and fried rice. Both were good, but clearly just re-heated in a microwave.

Free covered parking is available, lockers that you can rent for 100 yen that is returned to you after you return the key.

The gift shops contained standard Okinawa souvenirs - nothing very unique to just the castle.","Written January 24, 2018"

However, you could take short cut. About 50 m after post office, there is a sign to turn left into a parking area. You can use that short cut to lake on right then walk towards the castle and main entrance. Otherwise it is a long walk to main entrance. There is no sign but once you see the postiffice after walking from suri station. 100m you see post office. Then 50 m, turn left and u can see the castke on top of hill. There are many sites within the castle park. Each stop u can stamp the location. About 24 stopover points. Kids get excited stamping on the map. They will give u a map with blank space at the ticket counter.
From castle top see okinawa city. Quite amazing, the castle had been restored so more modern looking. U have to take off shoes before entering the main castle where you see where the king sleeps , etc. So wear socks. They will give u a bag to put your shoes. Do not take photos inside.

Somehow even though the ticket counter personnel saw me pushing a wheelchair, they did not offer such a service until i specifically requested as i saw another tip from a Tripadvisor reviewer.

It is definitely more ideal to take the cable car up and do a descend walk rather than the other way due to the gradient of the slope.

There is a cafe at midpoint in the glass house but it’s quite pricey so i would advice you to bring some snacks as the garden has many good spots for a picnic.

Since it is called an herb garden, there are herbs everywhere. You can purchase them or simply admire them in carts or on the hillside.
There is a Fragrance Museum and one of the options is for you to build your own fragranced perfume or bath oil to later purchase as a souvenir.
There is also another building called the Glasshouse which I suppose Westerners would call a Greenhouse. However, this one had a little stream running through it along with a miniature waterfall. In order to get to the Greenhouse from the summit, you need to walk down a bit along the paved path.

Here one can lie down on a hammock and enjoy looking at the deep blue sea and sky. After this, we headed to mid station to catch the ropeway to go all the way down. Before reaching , we encountered the last garden - Kaze no Oka flower garden. Really beautiful. We had lavender soft ice cream at the outdoor cafe.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great place to visit,Near Shin-Kobe station. We caught the nunobiki ropeway to the top. Nice view of Kobe city. They have many herbs on display. Nice walk down the hill as there are many different gardens to check out.,"Written November 9, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,One of the best locations we visited in Japan!,"An absolute must if you're planning to visit Kobe, or West Japan in general! The herb garden is conveniently located very close to Shin-Kobe station so it's easy to get to from Shin-Osaka. You take a cable car to the top; two of us aren't great with heights but the views are so beautiful you forget all about your fears. Once you get to the top, you are presented with incredible views across Kobe. You can then visit a lovely shop with great smelling products before descending down. There are loads of beautiful gardens and areas to chill. I would recommend lying on the hammocks and taking in the breathtaking views. We were lucky enough to also see some beautiful butterflies and hummingbirds. In summary, a great and unique place to visit!","Written October 21, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Garden with herbs and herb products,Lots of interesting products made from herbs in the shop on the top. It is good way to use the rope way to the top and walk down to the middle stop and to see the different parts of the garden. Beatiful place allthough all flowers were not on there best during this time of the year. Especially enjoyed the herb foot bath.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Skip this,"At time of our visit (early October), some of the plants and flowers have already wilted. It's a bit hard to appreciate because of the lack of English narratives to explain where specific herbs are commonly used. The gardens were also spread out in different areas so you had to hop from one small garden to another.

We appreciated the garden better while riding the cable car up the garden.","Written October 12, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Peaceful escape,A must visit location in Kobe. The garden has wonderful views over the city and is a great way to spend a couple hours out of the hustle and bustle. You can hike up for purchase cable car tickets to access the garden. A great spot to enjoy a cup of tea or an ice cream and unwind.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Most Beautiful and Colorful Gardens,"From Shin-Kobe Station you can go upstairs and take the Nunobiki Ropeway and on the top you will see the most beautiful and colorful garden. There are a lot of flowers, herbs, plants, and trees. We took a lot of photos because it is so beautiful. You can see flowers in the colors of the rainbow arranged beautifully in every direction.

There is a gift shop that sells everything herb (herb cookies, herb tea) and aromatherapy-related products, like essential oils, diffusers, soaps, and you can even pick a herb in a cart (like lavender) and buy it. There is also a restaurant next to the gift shop that sells main courses and desserts like ice creams.

To get to the middle ropeway station, you can hike down from the top garden and see more plants and flowers. A really beautiful place to walk around. More photos taken and there is also a waterfall patio in the shade of trees so you can rest a bit after a long walk down.

A really recommended place to visit when you are in Kobe. It is really nice to take a break from the busy city to a quiet and beautiful garden that will please your heart and eyes.",

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Nice afternoon out,"The cable car is near Shin Kobe station. The journey on the cable car is in 2 stages - you can do it all in one go or hop off at the middle station. We went to the top, walked back down through the gardens and hot the cable car back down from the middle station. Nice walk but steep. Stopped off for a drink and ice-cream. Views from cable car and at the top station are fantastic. Nice rose garden at the top full of English David Austin roses!","Written October 7, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A Great View of Kobe,"We took the Ropeway to the top station and then took the walkwaysthrough the many herb and flower gardens.
It was a beautiful aroma and a great view of Kobe.
Plenty of places to eat, we had lunch at the Glasshouse.","Written October 3, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great couple of hours,Definitely worth a visit. The return fare is ¥1500. We got the cable car to the top and walked slowly down through the various gardens which I found more interesting than I thought I would. We stopped at the glasshouse for a coffee and admire the glorious view over Kobe. Thankfully it was not too warm on the day so it was a very pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.,"Written October 3, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Arrive early and stay the day,"Go early and make a day of it. I made the day trip by train from Osaka - the garden is quickly and efficiently accessible from the subway stop. Just one flight up the elevator and follow the signs.

The tram ride was spectacular - you can see the famous waterfall, dam and take in a breathtaking view of the seaport and Kobe City.

I took the tram all the way up, strolled through the gardens at a leisurely pace and then took the tram back down at midpoint. Cost was 1500 yen round trip - super reasonable as that includes admission, an umbrella rental (for shade) and a 10 minute go at the relaxing herb foot bath (just pay 100 yen for a towel rental to wipe down your thankful feet afterward).

I can highly recommend the honey lemon soda (top station cafe) and the lavender ice cream for a refresher (booth near mid station).

I brought a book and sat at the many sitting areas - so many ideal spots to zen out! They even have hammocks for your relaxing enjoyment!

The glass garden was spectacular and was my favorite part of the garden.

See my photos for all the points of interest mentioned in this review and have a fabulous time!",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Marvellous experience,We had a day to spare in Kobe before watching a rugby game. When we read the reviews we were unsure whether it would be worth the visit. We took the cable car up and walked down. It was a lovely day. The gardens were spectacular and the walk down was lovely (although we did take a wrong turn or 2!). Would highly recommend,"Written September 30, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Cable car service closed suddenly without notice,"We went to this garden and to buy 3 round trip tickets, then get on the cable car. We are understand that the travelling time in cable car is a little bit longer because of strong wind. But the worse is we are walking around at the top and stay for around half an hour, then we walk to the middle station and try to get on the cable car back to the station. The staff told us that the cable car is now stop service and we have to walk to the mountain (from middle station back to station is for an hour). I am wondering why the car is suddenly stop service and did not have any announcement during walking downwards to the middle station. This is extremely bad! Many tourists like us did not alert that the car will suddenly stop service. We paid for round trip and did not have any other travelling tools back to station. After I negotiated with the staff and insist to arrange a car to deliver us back to station, then we wait for 15 mins, they finally arrange a car for us. If I am not asked for other transportation for us, then we have to walk for an hour back to station. I blamed that the gardens should have responsibility to take care of the tourists when the weather is not good enough for tour.","Written September 29, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Brilliant view,We walked from Shin Kobe station via the nearby shopping mall.We took the Ropeway which is a cable car.You can alight at the middle station and look at the extensive herb garden or do as we did and carry on to the next station.This has a viewing platform and bars and restaurants.We bought a dark beer and admired the view of Kobe bay and the Seto Inland sea.,"Written September 29, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Unless you want a long walk take the round trip ticket,"Access is via the ropeway or the falls. If you walk via the falls it’s a lot further.
The gardens are a linear display of a variety of different types of plants grouped by type, ie herbs are together.
Cafe facilities available.","Written September 26, 2019"

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Peaceful way to spend an afternoon,"Great views on the cable car going up. Then can take your time strolling down. Best to not be in a rush to enjoy all the seating areas and view along the way down.

Came on a Saturday and was pleasantly surprised it wasn't that crowded.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great view by night,"We recommend to go there by night.

The garden is already closed. You can go to the top with the ropeway (discounted admission after 5PM) and enjoy a beautiful view of the city and a peaceful atmosphere since there are no tourists anymore.
The last ride down is at 9PM.

Altough the prices are not cheap but the ride up alone is absoultely worth it.

The ground station is not that easy to find.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Beautiful,We took the cable car up around sunset and got an incredible view of Kobe from here. My friend and I waited until night time to leave and it is just as beautiful at night time too. The herb gardens themselves are also beautiful. The bar staff are lovely and very understanding and they speak some English. A definite recommended for anyone who enjoys a good view.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A real treat in Kobe,"I am so glad to be here. I was able to view the panoramic view of the city. If you have the Kobe Tourism coupon, you can save 700yen from the cable car.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Best garden so far in Japan,This garden totally different from other place in Japan. Love every single things in this Garden. Love the ropeway which is the best view of Kobe. You can see the sea over here. Then in the peak you had the calm and peacefull situation. So relaxing!!!! The price for ropeway is 1.500 yen and that's totally worth it! Love ya,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Cable car service closed suddenly without notice,,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Beautiful gardens and a nice hike down,"We took the cable car up to the top station, which gave us a nice view of the city and steal view of the gardens.
The gardens themselves were serene and beautiful, and very quiet at the time of our visit due to it raining a bit.
We walked down through the garden, and visited the glass greenhouse, before continuing down the hiking trail.
As soon as we left the garden gates, a wild boar with a small piglet ran grunting across the road!
The hike down through the green forests, over bridges and past waterfalls was a nice and easy walk, with plenty of sights.
We probably spent around 3 hours from the top of the gardens and back down to the station, walking at a very slow pace, taking in the scenery and taking alot of pictures.","Written June 27, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,one of my favourites places in Japan,"Take up the ropeway, enjoy the views over Kobe and then walk down a beautiful garden and greenhouse and see some waterfalls.

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A little boring but very nice views,Went there with the kids and the tram was a lot of fun. The garden itself is very impressive . Lots of steps and walking so bring lots of water. There is an ice-cream concession at the mid point and it is a rip-off so don't bother with that. Bring your own food. My wife really liked this place and I thought it was okay.,"Written June 23, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Lovely walk,"We spent a couple of hours at the herb garden in the morning before getting on our cruise and it was very relaxing.

We caught the ropeway to the top station, walked around the area and then slowly walked down to the middle station. There're heaps to see in the walk including the glasshouses and also a free foot bath near the glass house which was awesome.

You can also see the waterfall from the ropeway. I would like to walk to the waterfall but didn't have enough time.

Definitely worth spending a couple of hours in the garden.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Serene,"We did a quick trip up the ropeway and walked down. Not enough time to take it all in, but what we saw and smelled was fragrant, well marked, explained in English and Japanese, with what looked like a lot of interactive learning opportunities along the way. Lush plantings and scents surround you during the entire experience.","Written June 17, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Worth the trip!,We almost didn’t do this trip as it didn’t seem to be a popular attraction. But luckily we did! Both the elderly and kids in our group thoroughly enjoyed the trip. View of Kobe from the rope way was fascinating. The walk down the garden to mid hill station was very enjoyable. Many varieties of flowers to see. We had fun smelling the different flower scent. All of us also had herbal foot bath at the glasshouse. Totally worth the trip!,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Relaxing time enjoying the flowers and views from ropeway.,"Both ropeway and gardens are wheelchair accessible. The gardens’ information centre provides free use of electric wheelchair to explore gardens that has slopes not suited for manual wheelchair.

Nice views of Kobe city",

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,So beautiful!,"We had a really nice time in this beautiful garden. We were sort of exhausted from spending the last two days in Osaka and Universal Studios and this peaceful garden was just what we needed to re-energize. We took the Ropeway to the top and walked down from there. We explored all the different flowers and herbs, bought some specialty products and soaked our feet in the herbal bath overlooking Kobe.
We decided to hike all the way down to the nearby waterfalls. It was not that bad of a hike and the falls were beautiful. We arrived back at the Shin-Osaka Station at the end of the day.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,BEAUTIFUL!!!,"I had only a few hours to tour Kobe and this spot was recommended by the hotel information. I was lucky to have a clear beautiful day, the blooming was breathtaking and the Japanese gardening is just amazing. Don't miss!!",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Spectacular,One of the stops on the City Loop Bus. Easy walk from Shin Kobe through the ANA hotel. Normal return Rope Way (cable car) Y 1500. < 10 minutes ride to the summit. Groups and individuals appear to get their own car. From the top the view over Kobe is spectacular. Of course the usual F&B / retail outlets at all levels. I chose to walk down to the middle Station. What a great move. If time had permitted I would have walked all the way down to the base. Recommend buy a one way ticket up and walk down. Try the Lavender Ice Cream 😛,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,German inspired buildings with an amazing view,"We entered the gardens by ropeway, and felt immediately like we left Japan. The architecture of the buildings on the top is very inspired by Germany, and there are lots of small shops for food and drinks. The gardens themselves are very nice and well kept. For a city like Kobe that does not have that many attractions, this is definately a place worth going to - however expensive to access by ropeway.","Written May 23, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,"Fantastic Gardens, with Great Views of Kobe","This is a great trip to see fabulous gardens, with amazing views from the cable car and the various terraces. The gardens are delightful, and you can walk back down through the gardens to the half way station. It would be spectacular later in the season when the tulips and the roses start to bloom. Very well priced, considering how much time you can spend there.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A definite must visit,"The Herb & Flower Gardens are located on a hillside. The best way to explore is to access the top and gradually walk down.

Take a subway to Shin-Kobe Station; then ask any friendly local, where the 'Ropeway to Nunobiki' is. Within the station is an elevator that will eventually take you up and out to a pathway with signs pointing up to the Ropeway station.

The ropeway is the Japanese term for cablecar. Take a slow walk upwards to the ropeway. The price for the ride is also the entrance fee to the gardens.

Staff will advise you to take the cablecar to the highest station, then explore and stroll downwards, until the middle station and take the cablecar downwards.

If you have time, 2-3 hours will be fantastic. If you plan to have lunch up at the top station 3-4 hours will be sufficient. If you are pressed for time, 1-2 hours will still leave you happy.

Depending on the season, different flowers will be in bloom. Gardeners, landscape workers, horticulturalists, all busy like bees. Surely a labor of love. Waterfalls, streams, rest benches, all make this place so restful and relaxing. If only we have a whole day.

I found a herb I liked very much; unfortunately its dried leaves were not sold at the souvenir shop. The herb has the exact aroma of the Japanese curry, and I thought it would be marvellous to make my own Japanese curry at home.

There are restaurants and shops at the top. Views of the city are fantastic.","Written May 17, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A nice view on top of a mountain,"The Herb Garden is set on top of a hill just above the Kobe station. There are two ways to reach the Herb garden. You could walk up the hill or take a cable car.
Walking up the hill is only for those who have at least half a day of time or better a day.
At the top, there is a view of the Kobe city.",

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Very nice in spring though a bit commercial,"The ropeway up is very nice, but a beautiful view of Kobe. The gardens are nice with herbs and pretty flowers. Very lovely on a sunny day in spring. You can enjoy fragrances, some food, beer or wine and it's just pleasant to spend some time there. Not spectacular, but it doesn't always has to be, as it is highly relaxing. They do sell all kinds of stuff and give you multiple flyers with promotions and such, which is kind of a shame, but understandable. People interested in all kinds of beauty products could have a field day here.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A perfect Spring outing,"Enjoyed this place immensely, The gondola ride up offered stunning views of Kobe.The gardens were in full spring bloom with cherry blossoms, tulips, hyacinths and many more flowers.

Do not cone to Kansai without visiting here:),
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Rainy Yet Wonderful,"The day I visited it was raining but not too heavily. So, even though I wanted to hike up to the gardens it made sense to take the cable car which I did. The views were amazing and the ride to the top was smooth and comfortable.

The garden had a variety of beautiful herbs and flowers which were arranged to fit the setting. I enjoyed smelling the variety of oils and taking in the views from different areas of the garden. The shop is well stocked and the restaurant menu is varied.

Going there is equally fun as you will take a cable ride of about 20 minutes to the top, offering scenic views as well of the mountains and the waterfall along the way.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Well worth the trip to the top,"Picked up the cable car close to Shin Kobe JR station. The entrance was close to the Ana Crowne Plaza hotel.

We booked a return trip by cable car up to see the herb gardens. The cost in GBP was approximately £11 pp.

A lovely ride up in the cable car with simply stunning views over Kobe and right out to sea. On a clear day you will get some lovely pictures.

The gardens themselves were very pretty and there were a couple of gift shops and a cafe and tourist information counter.
Lots of seating areas and picnic facilities.

There was an excellent viewing platform which provided more picture opportunities.

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,You can’t go wrong!,"This is a great little excursion if you have a few hours and want to get outdoors.

Ride up- walk down. Browse the first shop, wander through the gardens, stop for tea and a pork cutlet sandwich at the glass house, then take a short jaunt in a little forest and past a waterfall. The waterfall is less incredible than the view from the basin so look up and around.

Emerge behind Shin-Kobe station and grab a snack from the 7-11.","Written March 14, 2019"

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Nunobiki Herb Garden – Beautiful Japanese (Botanical) Gardens,"We took a Taxi from the Kobe Cruise Port to the Nunobiki Herb Gardens on Mount Rokko for around $15 CAD. A round-trip ticket on the Gondola (in Japan they call Gondolas “Ropeways”) cost $1500 yen ($18 CAD) per person. Buy your ticket inside from a machine and then walk to the Gondola boarding area.

Once onboard it takes about 10 minutes to get to the top Terrace (the views are fantastic) where there are many gardens (flowers, herbs) and a shop that sells different botanical/other products. You can easily spend 2 to 3 hours here. The Veranda Café is a bit pricey $4,800 Yen for English style Tea and cakes for 3 people (around $20 CAD each) but for the great views, atmosphere and excellent service it’s worth the price!

We walked down to mid-way station (you have to) to get back on board the Gondola; the paths are full of beautiful plants and there is a waterfall you can visit. It is a bit steep though, so it wouldn’t be good for anyone who has trouble walking, but there are places to stop and rest. There’s a City Loop Bus stop nearby (after you exit the Main building follow the signs down a small hill) so when we left to go to the Chinatown area downtown, we took the bus.

In Kobe the City Loop Bus (Stops are clearly marked) Adults Fares cost $260Y for a single fare ($3 CAD) or $660Y for an All-day Pass ($8 CAD), you just pay the Driver. It takes you to many different locations and tourist sites throughout the City, including the Nunobiki Herb Gardens and downtown Mall area, and runs every 20 minutes but it does get very crowded. From the Mall you can easily walk to the 2 main shopping districts in Kobe and Chinatown.

Tip - Sign up (on your phone) for Kobe FREE Wi-Fi, it can be used by Tourists for up to 7 days and worked well in the Cruise Port Terminal AND throughout most areas in Kobe.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Blue love,"I was madly in love with the amazing view from top of the mountain to see.

As it was down season , I missed to enjoy the actual beauty of the garden with flowers.Kobe is a very small city and it is possible to cover up the whole kobe within nearly half a day if you are not going to spend time in shopping.But I loved to do shopping there.

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Gorgeous - a must visit for Kobe,"We visited Kobe on a day trip from cruise ship.
We undertook as a self directed activity and just got a taxi with another couple from the ship port up to Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens and took the mountain scenic car ropeway.

Great ride up on the cable car and lookout over Kobe.

Cute photo opps in the gorgeous gardens with giant bees and butterfly’s buzzing around.

There is a nice gift shop up the top, get lost in all the scents with handmade oils etc

Gorgeous glasshouse at mid level- really worth a visit - steamy lush gardens.

I recommend if you have time and are reasonably fit enough (ie no major injuries) then catch the cable car up one way and walk down through the levels at your own leisure and really enjoy. It’s an easy walk down and a beautiful environment to wander around and rest in.

We had the most delicious lavender ice cream cones at mid level.

We caught taxi into town from hotel down the bottom of mountain.

I would recommend it to people who want to see a beautiful view on Kobe and who wants to take a break from the city and walk around in the nature! Lovely time spent here :)

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Wonderful attraction,"This place offers a few things: a quiet ride up the hill for an overview of Kobe, lovely garden to stroll in (better in spring or autumn for the colors), a small section of essential oils (to find out your preferred scent), gift shop to buy a momento or two, greenhouse (for visitors in winter who still want to see some greens) and the Garden Terrace (if you need a bite). Would definitely recommend a visit here.","Written January 1, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,"Well worth the trip to the top, even in winter","I would highly recommend this attraction. You can spend half a day here as there are plenty of small gardens, a herbal footbath, sachet making etc. It is very scenic and you get a great view over Kobe.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Nice soothing garden with nice gift shop,"Visited in Dec 2018 and took a cable car up to the very top and arrived at the gardens. Not the best season to visit as there aren't many flowers. However, it does have a very nice view overlooking the city and a soothing scent of herbs mixed in the grass.

They sell a lot of nice essential oils and you should definitely try them. You can buy them if you are into aromatherapy but if you aren't, just take a sniff. Since the flowers and herbs are home-grown, it smells very different from what you will get in your hometowns. Especially the lavender one smells different but still calming as compared to French Lavender.

After that, we took a slow walk down to the mid-station where we pass by the greenhouse as well.

Tip: I noticed a lot of people just walked quickly down to the greenhouse and after that to the mid-station. Walk slowly and look around, there are many trees, flowers, herbs, fruits, vegetables, herbs and many more which you can admire. The plants are also labelled with the name of their species so take a moment to admire them as well!

If not for the season I visited in, I would have given it a 5 star.","Written December 24, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Herb Garden and cable car ride,Nice elevated view of Kobe. Great place to visit any time off the year. Forested hills makes good photography point.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Wonderful Place,You must visit the garden and glasshouse even when it is cold and the weather not so good. Everything is beautifully arranged and clean. Good sign posts and explanations. Nice walk (but steep so you need good shoes) and a bit of energy. The buildings and perfume exhibitions are nicely done. I’d always come back here again,

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Very nice and tranquil.,"This place is awesome. Very close to shin kobe station. You can hike up and down but the best is to take the cable car up. The cable car offers 1 way up or both way. Price differ if you buy together and separate. My advice is to buy both ways. You can hike down to the middle station and take the cable car down.

This place has many beautiful plants and flowers. With the cooling weather, it is just perfect. The very top is the main part where they house cafes and souvenir shop and etc.

Hike down to see the flowers and the glass house. Glasshouse is beautiful. They have a restaurant called The Verandah. Nicely decorated and they also have an indoor garden.

Along the hike down there's a picnic place where you can rest and relax.

During winter it will get very cold and windy.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Beautifully laid out garden,"Take the cable car (ropeway) up to the mountain and a very gentle walk back down to the mid station. the plants on the walk down, which takes about 45 minutes, or longer if you stop and read about each exhibit, are stunningly laid out, with good explanations accompanying the plants and herbs. To walk down from the mid station back to the bottom takes about 90 minutes, so most people walk the first section then get the ropeway back to ground level.
We visited this herb garden after going to Himeji castle from Osaka and returned to Osaka, so both can be accomplished in the same but tiring day","Written November 26, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Would probably be better in the summer.,"Came here in the fall and although their four seasons gardens and changing fall leaves was still very nice, I imagine this place is much prettier in the spring or summer when all flowers are in full bloom. Even so, the place is gorgeous and the indoor gardens is very nice. Really nice and relaxing place to spend the day (there's even a foot spa by the glass house/greenhouse to rest your tired feet on your way down).",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great garden with nice views of kobe,"Fantastic day with a great view! Peaceful and calm. Cable car was fun, had the cable car to ourselves. There was the option to hike down the entire as well.

The gardens were beautiful, filled with flowers and landscaping plants. There's also a few scenic spots where you can chill and relax, overseeing Kobe.

There's a footbath area, it's free, just need to pay 100JPY for a towel to dry your feet after.

I spent a good 2hours there.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Breathtaking view,The view of Kobe from the ropeway is breathtaking. Upon arriving at the highest station you are greeted by a feast of different flowers. We ventured into the rose garden and the perfume from the different roses was a delightful aroma. We walked down the hill and were greeted by beds and beds of flowers. What an enchanting place.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great view and nice Ropeway,"It’s a 6 min walk from Shin-Kobe station, great Ropeway getting us all the way to the top and the view is amazing !",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Stunning view,"We walked up and took the rope way down . Probably would have been smarter to do it the other way around! The gardens were pretty I'm not a huge flower person but it was nice. The village at the top was interesting with souvenirs, German food and beer. It was strange being in a german type village with weird Disneyland music playing loudly. But they view over Kobe was so so pretty. It was quiet enough that we got our own cart the whole way down. Had a nice lavender icecream in the garden.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Aroma galire,Very nice place. Lotsa flowers. Enjoyed the ropeway ride. There was also a fragrance museum. Roses were so lovely.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Lovely Garden to walk through,"From the top of ropeway you walk down the hill which gives you nice views of Kobe. There is a wide, winding cement path that cuts through as you enjoy the plants and flowers. There may be a little too much to see but it's nice to stroll through, plus there are some benches where you take a rest. And don't forget to try relaxing in a hammock. There are a couple of locations where they are set out for visitors and you can lie down and relax while enjoying the view. About halfway down there is a place where you can hop back on the ropeway which takes you back down.","Written October 15, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Pleasant time with a ropeway ride,"The Herb Garden is located very near the JR Shin Kobe Station. In fact as you get off the Shinkansen in the station you see the gondolas move over the mountain in the backdrop of the station. You will have to fork out 1500 yen for a round trip on the gondola and visit to the herb garden.We wanted to walk down( one way ticket is 950 yen) on the way back but we were told at the information booth that it would take us 2 hours to do that and that the route will be dark in the evening. A gondola seemed to accommodate 4 persons and they earmark one gondola per family even if the number of members are less than 4. The staff is young and friendly and the ropeway is very safe and the views terrific . On the way up you can enjoy the view of a dam a waterfall besides a panoramic view of Kobe harbour. Nearer the end of the ride you will go past very colourful gardens.Take the ropeway right up to the Herb Gardens Top Station( although you have the option of getting off at the Mid Station). At the top are view rest houses, restaurants, shops selling various items including those made from herb. You can see the Rose Symphony Garden, Miri no Hall ( concert hall), etc. which have nice decorations. We also saw a Fragnance museum and a Fragrant Garden( from which we saw the walking trail but did not see anyone on it) but did not think much of it. You then walk down the lovely garden path past the Herb Museum,Kitchen Garden , Lavender Garden ( where is the Lavender?)a detour to a Glasshouse( spend some time, the view is terrific, there are cafes too),Four Seasons Garden , lovely Kaze no Oka Flower Garden and finally board the gondola at the Mid Station. There are adequate public toilets in the walk. They close by around 5.30 PM however on weekends and holidays the top observatory is open till 8.30PM. Overall a little overpriced but worth it. Earmark at least 2 hours for this attraction.",

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Japan with an alpine feel,"We didn’t think there would be such gorgeous gardens this late in the year, but everywhere we looked there were blossoms and even buds. The rope way is fun, two to a car (other locations should take note of this and stop cramming 6-8 total strangers in a car!) The view of Kobe is spectacular. We rode up and walked down—you would never know there was a typhoon three days ago!",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Stunning area.,"Cable car (called rope car in Japan) to and from this location is both fun and very cheap.

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Peaceful and scenic garden,"Although not exactly a garden person, I must admit this underrated attraction has wowed me with its scenic hill slope location, peacefully tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city below. The best way to enjoy this garden is to take the ropeway to the Rest House at the top station, and casually stroll down the easy footpath. Along the way, you will be whiffed by the pleasant aromas from the the herbs and flowers, overwhelmed with perfectly manicured gardens, and be enchanted by the serenity within the Glasshouse. Just before you re-board the cable car at the mid station, relax on the hammock at the recreation area as you gaze down on the port city of Kobe and it’s sparkling bay beyond.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Serenity,"If you're into flowers and plants, this is the place for you. The place is so serene and peaceful, very nice to have a morning walk. There are plenty of places to sit and just relax, there are even hammocks around. Different types of flowers and vegatables abound, much like a really huge garden. There are also a cable cars going into the garden and you will see a falls - we tried walking here but got lost- and realized that this is already out of the Herb garden area. There's also an essential oils museum where you can smell the different types of oils and i believe they sell them too, some as expensive as ten thousand yen! There are also food stands and restaurants selling local delights at reasonable price. Over all, this is a nice place to visit, prepare to spend at least 2- 4 hours depending on how much you're into botany.","Written August 27, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,More of a gift shop / restaurant than extensive gardens,"As you arrive at the top of the ropeway to the Kobe herb garden you'll find that the main area is more of a restaurant and gift shop than anything else.

The gardens themselves, as you descend down the hill again, are quite nice and there are a few nice places to stop and rest (hammocks and seating provided) and the views over Kobe are really good.

However, the gardens aren't terribly extensive and there isn't a great deal of exploring to do. If you are expecting a botanic garden type experience you may need to lower your expectations.

Having said that given the views it is still a good way to spend a few hours in Kobe.","Written August 17, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great place to view of the city,"We took cable car to the top. Unfortunately we were unable to go to the herb garden as it was closed (so early).

There wasn't much to walk around so we waited for over two hours to see the night view of the city. It was wonderful. Besides, it said there would be lights performance every 20 minutes at night but we saw nothing.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Beautiful views of Kobe and spectacular gardens!,"We arrived on a cruise ship, took the Portliner monorail to Sannomiya Station, transferred to the subway to Shinkobe and found our way to the Ropeway to the Nunobiki Herb Garden. Even though few people speak English, the signage is good—and in English, so you can find your way. The ride up in the gondola was spectacular. Clear blue skies allowed perfect views of Kobe and the harbor below. We bought a one-way ticket, planning to walk down through the gardens. At the top we found the beautiful View Plaza—full of flowers and statues and displays—perfect for photos. Cherry blossoms presented a lovely view as the wind blew beautiful pink blossoms through the air. We stopped to see the Fragrance Museum, with displays of perfume bottles from the 1900’s. You can actually create your own perfume there if you want. Walking down through the gardens full of tulips, azaleas, pansies, wild flowers, and beautifully manicured trees was amazing. We explored the amazing glass greenhouse full of plants and flowers, and continued down the path through more gardens with waterfalls, herbs, and flowers. By the time we got to the midway station, we opted to take the gondola back to the bottom—skipping the rest of the hiking trail and the lower waterfalls, though we did catch a glimpse of them from the gondola on the way down. It was a magnificent morning, and we highly recommend it!",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Interesting place and worth the visit,"We hiked up from the shin Kobe JR station pass. all the waterfalls and ended up at herb gardens.

However, the heat was killing us. Anyway, we still enjoyed the fragrance museum. We split into two groups. One tried the fragrance workshops. The other group walked down to visit the herb garden.

We stopped in the area at the top to have a drink of speciality Japanese tea in one place and a lunch snack in another and toexplore the herb museum and the shops.

The cable car ride was fun and the views terrific, but the walk back down (halfway) through the gardens was a delight. There were more herbs and spices growing than I knew existed and the gardens were beautifully maintained. Many of the pants had their names in Latin and Japanese and some in English.

The walk takes you to the half-way station on the ropeway from where the descent to the city is very scenic, with views of the Nunobiki waterfall to one side.","Written June 21, 2018"

They were interleaved with lavender bushes, so I get the feeling that the garden will be even more impressive with one or more flowers from about March to whenever their maple leaves turn red.

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,if you love gardens and fragrant flowers and so much more...,"...then you must put this ""so much more than just a herb garden"" at the very top of your list when you are in kobe. as the website says:
""Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens are Japan’s largest herb gardens with about 75,000 herbs and flowers of about 200 kinds blooming throughout the year.
""There are 14 garden areas where visitors are welcomed by seasonal herbs and flowers arranged according to different themes.""
but indeed there's so much more than that - from the 10-minute 400m ""ropeway"" (gondola) ride up mount rokko to the 16ha (40-acre) garden (look down for a glimpse of nunobiki waterfall) to the food variety (snacks to very fancy pastries with special teas) to the flower- and herb-based soaps, lotions, posies and other shopping delights.
and let's not forget the panoramic view over kobe - city and harbour, so close yet delightfully removed and world away from this nature escape.
we eschewed the three-hour hike up in favour of starting our visit sooner, gradually winding our way back down through the gardens - stopping every few minutes to enjoy the varied and wonderful fragrances of the herbs, flowers, leaves (""wow, come and smell this one!"") in the different and often themed garden areas.
unexpected features included an opportunity to create your own fragrant posy with dried herbs, petals and so on, and to make your own flower arrangement.
there's an expansive grassy area for children to play in, plenty of benches and tables to enjoy food you bought or brought, countless photo opportunities (i particularly liked the ""in the frame"" one, where you sit/pose in a large angled frame with a marigold-covered hill behind you).
so many wonderful experiences: i'm still smiling as i write this and recall our meander down to the mid-station where we got into the gondola to take us the rest of the way over the lower half of the hill.
somehow we missed the herbal footbath - ah well, a good reason to go back for another visit, perhaps during a different season.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great ride up the hillside.,"Yes a really good place to visit, well worth the 1500円, nice to walk around with lots of interesting smells to smell.
Walked back down to the glass house, then caught lift back down.

You can spend 2-3 hours here, good place on a wet or sunny day.",

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Pleasant visit,We had a morning to spare in Kobe so we went on the ropeway up the Herb Garden. Lovely view of Kobe. It was a pleasant walk amongst the plants but to be honest nothing extraordinary. The highlight was the beautiful terrace overlooking the city and harbour. Here we enjoyed a lovely herbal tea on the sunny terrace.,"Written May 2, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Do Not Miss,"It is definitely worth a visit. The rope way up and the views are stunning. The flowers are everywhere and it is just so beautiful and relaxing. Stroll through the Gardens and check out the large variety of herbs.

Tulips in plenty all over and the restaurant and store are very nice too","Written May 1, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Relax,"Nice panorama on top of the hill. There are 2 stations where you'll ride until last station, then take a walk down to the mid station.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Perfect half day in Kobe,"Situated near the southern exit from Shin Kobe station, the flowers and herbs beckon you to enter their enchanted world. Kobe Nunobiki Herb Garden is the most beautiful I’ve ever visited, requiring a cable car trip, about 8mins to reach the top station, then take in the stunning views of Port Kobe. There amidst the flowers and herb gardens, is nestled a museum of herbs, complete with gorgeous coffee shops and restaurants. Meander down the mountain passing glorious displays of herbs and flowers.....you’ll feel enlivened and calm. Take a hot spring foot bath (free). But bring a small towel (you can donate 100yen for a towel there though.
Continue down to the mid station, passing fountains, Asian herbs, tulips and a very large flower conservatory.
What a wonderful way to spend a few hours in Kobe, and build an appetite for some of their famous Kobe Beef!!
Entry including the cable car was 1500 yen return ticket.
I wouldn’t try to walk the return journey as it looks difficult, long, and a waste of valuable time which can be used visiting other delights of Kobe!",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,For lovers of plants and flowers,"This garden on the mountainside is ideal for lovers of plants and flowers. It is best in the spring or the fall, in my opinion. It has easy walking paths between a large variety of plants and flowers. There is a ""ropeway"" cable car that is available to ride up the mountain, if you prefer, and then you can walk down through the paths of herbs and flowers. It does close early so best not to arrive later than about 3:30 p.m. if you really want to enjoy it to the fullest. There is a nice view of the city of Kobe from the top, as well as a gift shop.","Written April 29, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Spring has Sprung,"Plants, Ropeway, easy walk and food, all here. If you want a short hike then there is a steep walk either up or down (both if keen). The hike is supposed to be about 1 & 1/2 hours and would require suitable footwear.
We took the ropeway return. It takes you to the top point and after enjoying a lovely walk through well labelled gardens with many cafes and restaurants to choose from we ended at the mid point to return by the ropeway.
We had an excellent day with the weather and right time for the spring flowers. Leaflets available in more than one language including English.
Close to train station, so easy to find and again not far to walk. Many areas to look and smell the frangrances, herbs and spices. Plants bountiful and labelled. Lavender ice cream something different to try. As everywhere in Japan, clean, tidy, well signposted including in English. It can be very busy as a popular place for everyone, families, couples of all ages and friends. But we never felt a crush as big enough to spread out and the ropeway limits the number of passengers.
A lot of photo opportunities with stands for self timing cameras too.","Written April 29, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Worth a visit to Kobe,"Don’t be put off by the term ‘ herb garden’. These are beautifully designed and presented gardens that follow the contour of the hillside down the mountain behind the city of Kobe. The pathways and gardens are meticulously maintained and they are obviously planned so that there is something beautiful to look at during the different seasons.
In late April the tulips and azaleas were flowering but we could see how lavender and roses must become the main feature by summer. There are mature trees , herbaceous borders and flowering annuals throughout the garden.

At the glass house area is a free hot foot spa where you can dangles your tootsies before continuing on your walk. A small towel in your backpack would be handy!

If you like gardens don’t miss this beautiful place. It’s not the traditional Japanese garden but a very well designed modern one.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Beautiful escape from the city,"Nunobiki Herb Garden is quiet on a Wednesday morning, making it a perfect place to be if you are already weary from city sights.

Two way to get to the gardens up in the mountain: hike up from Shin-Kobe Station (follow the signs around the station); take the cable car from behind Crowne Plaza, accessible by a sheltered walkway on ground level.

Check the weather forecast before you go, as the cable car might shut down as a safety precaution during strong winds.

Nunobiki Herb Garden has both indoor and outdoor exhibits. The outdoor gardens are a bliss to explore and offer many photo opportunities.

There are cafes and ice-cream shops at the gardens, and it is lovely to have a hot cup of tea and a fragrant flower ice-cream while you rest your feet.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,UNFAIR TREATMENT OF GUESTS,"Even though I arrived at the Ropeway just before they decided to close the Herb Garden due to 'strong winds', they let a tour group in because they had 'booked'. Goes to show they only think about the big money. Avoid this company.","Written April 5, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,So many herbs!,"The gardens themselves were fantastic. So many herbs! It really surpassed my expectations of what we would see. It was organized in a nice way where you just walk down the mountain and see the different plants. Good views of the city and numerous bathrooms.

We took the cable car up and walked all the way down. I would not want to walk up to the gardens, it was pretty steep. Walking down wasn't terrible, but make sure you have comfortable shoes. Obviously the cable car is quicker than walking.","Written April 2, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,"Nice Place, Relaxing and Great Views","I'm not a flower, plant or herb guy, but did want to give our kids the experience of riding the gondola, so we chose to visit here. Adjacent to the Shin-Kobe station. The gondola ride was fun, giving great views of Kobe, the harbor and waterfall. Upon reaching the top, there were countless photo opportunities with great views and backgrounds of flowers, etc. The park made it easy to take family photos by having prepositioned photo stations where you could rest and set your camera. There are a few eating areas and gift shops where you can buy herb infused lotions, snacks, oils, etc. You can walk or take the gondola and we opted to take the gondola both ways. However, if we had more time, and did not have small children, it would have been nice to hike down the entire mountain. Overall a nice experience and would do this again.","Written April 1, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Truly amazing with all the blossom,Im travelling solo in Japan for 2 weeks and wanted to spend Easter afternoon in a nice place. The whole experience was amazing and i had a great day. I bought a return cable car ticket but only used it one way as you walk from the top admiring different types of gardens and then either u take the ropeway from mid station or hike down. The hike is easy and you will pass the waterfalls on the way to shin Kobe station. Great opportunities for pictures in many places in the gardens.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Closed to 15th march!,Be carefull. The rope train is closed to 15 march 2018. We tried go there last week but was closed. So We must try do this next time ;) Have a good time!,

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Photogenic view of Kobe,"Situated behind Shin-Kobe station, the Nunobiki Herb Garden and ropeway is a great place to visit for leisurely hour or two to escape the hustle of the city. The view of Kobe and its surrounds on the top station of the ropeway is one of the best, day or evening.

There are many opportunities here for the photo enthusiast, with the top station a European inspired village with statues and a rose garden. Stairs descend into the Herb Garden where manicured gardens line the way down a comfortable, picturesque stroll full of scenery and aroma.

There is some light meals and snacks available at the top station, but probably best visit with a full stomach to best appreciate the view. It's quite a fair walk all the way down from the top, but the walk from top station to mid station is quite pleasant if you want just the right balance between a stroll and taking the ropeway. Of course, the ropeway is recommended for the way up.

Come for the nice view, leave relaxed and satisfied. That's how I felt at least.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great view of Kobe,This is a great site for a view of Kobe. Having travelled in winter it was freezing cold and gardens were not in the best condition. I could imagine that it would be great in spring time. Little tip. Go to tourist information centre at train station and you get a booklet with discount vouchers on attractions in Kobe. They were also super helpful. Worth the visit when in Kobe.,"Written February 4, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,"Many things to see, good food, lots of photo spots","Easily accessible by ropeway. Huge garden in western style with houses, shops, restaurants, and ancient western style buildings. A lot of trees, plants, flowers and greenery. The food in the restaurant is very good and nicely presented. We love the buffet. Also there are several shops there as well as a number of great photo spots. You will need at least a few hours to walk around.","Written February 1, 2018"

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Oasis in the heart of the vibrant Kobe,"Visited Kobe Herb Garden and it's restaurant in August.
The place is magical for those who want to switch from a vibrant, busy city to a calming quiet place for a few hours.

The buffet is cozy with a panoramic view window. Nice for tea time (with a wide variety of tea types they grow themselves in the Garden). It's also nice for having lunch: curry rice, potato chips, desserts, etc.

They play relaxing music all over the place (!) — even in the Garden galleries, which is amazing!

And, of course, you can buy natural products (such as herb tea, facial, hand and body creams, and lotions, postcards, essences, fragrances) made with the herbs they grow uphill in the Herb Garden.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Beautiful location above Kobe,If you like to hike and enjoy some nice views over the city of Kobe this is the perfect location. It is easy to reach from ShinKobe station close to the Crown Ana Hotel. All details of these herbal gardens are maintained in the Japanese perfectionist way. You will miss nothing here. Highly recommended.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A seasonal place,"We went during January, however, there is less flower to see due to winter season. But good thing is there is no crowd, which I like the most.

There is some renovation in the glass house, but still can enter to check on the spices museum.

The restaurant of herb garden did serve some nice food, especially their herb tea. We end up buy a few tea back home.","Written January 23, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Not that worth in January,"Went there in January and in my oppion not worth in this season (end December - January ). The garden lives from a blooming botany. Currently there is nothing like this. Entrance for cable car is 1400 yen, so not to cheap. Pretty sure this is a nice place in other season.

Pro: really nice overview of Kobe !",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,"Nice view, nice flowers and nice stroll","Plenty of things to do and see, you need at least 3 hours here. Especially if you want to trek down from the top station to the mid Station to enjoy the Gardens and greenhouse. Highly recommended for a date spot too. Nice view, pretty flowers and Very romantic ambiance and lots to see. Enjoyed my time here, should have stayed longer but I had to move to the rest of kobe.","Written January 5, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Wauw - a fantastic view,"From the garden, and on the way uphill by the ropeway, you get an amazing view. We were lucky the weather was beatyfull, and we could easyly overlook the whole city and harbour.

The garden area was nice. But we were not that impressed by the food facilities. No coffeshop. You have to go for a dancy and expensive restaurant or junkfood.","Written January 1, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Must see in Kobe,"We were there on 21Dec. We took the cable up but decided to walk down to catch the sights and the waterfall.
It was a very pleasant and scenic ride up to the peak. At the peak, the perfume or scent museum is a must visit.
I have never smelled so many fragrances of flowers, herb and plants. It is not just rose, lavender but cardamon, frankincense and myrrh! I was delighted with the experience of smelling such fragrances that you would only read about.

The next place we visited was the herb garden, that was another wonderful experience. Though it was winter, many of the herbs were still available. There was also a vegetable area where you get to see turnips, squash and asparagus grow. Some of the sqaush are so gigantic!

On our way down, we tried to locate the waterfall and followed the sign but I think they led us wrongly down a mountain road. Luckily we managed to find a path next to the road and finally found our way to the waterfall - it was getting fairly dark at 4pm because of winter. But we did manage to enjoy the waterfall and it was a great experience.

So I would recommend that you buy a one-way cable car (they call it ropeway) and walk either the ascend or the descend. I would love to visit this place again in the summer where everything will be in full bloom.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,European feel to it,It is an interesting place to get to. Once there the buildings and surrounding courtyard have a European look and feel to it due to the abundance of bars and restaurants and outdoor eating. There are some stunning views from the top and a nature trail to go on as well as the path that leads down to the herb garden and another station to catch the ropeway back down to Kobe.,"Written December 17, 2017"

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Curated park areas with floral beauty - take the cable car,"Seriously, take the cable car up and then walk down. Hiking up the mountain is quite difficult, to the point where I questioned my ability to wander back down and ended up buying a round-trip ticket from the mid-station up and back down.

But if I had the strength I would have definitely taken my time to stroll down the mountainside. The gardens have been curated so well, that even the efforts of the gardens' staff is visible from the cable cars.

At the top is a Western-style 'town' area of refreshments and souvenirs. There are arrangements of flowers and floral sculptures to take pictures with, and the view of Kobe city from the top is stunning.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Beautiful views,We managed to rush a visit on the ropeway up to the herb garden. We didnt have to walk around unfortunately but the trip was well worth it and views amazing. It was appoximately 15 minutes each way and some time to take photos at the top.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,So pretty! Pick a great season to get the best view,"We went there when the trees still in transition to autumn. Too bad can barely see golden leaves. Feel so close to nature. The air is so fresh. Quite nice to take a walk if you have time and energy of course. But I suggest to pay for gondola if you can’t walk uphill (quite a long distance but maybe the view is amazing, too).

They sell their special produce like tea or natural soap. Everything seems so natural. They sell the seeds, too.

Enjoy your time too chill here.
Not a must visit if the season’s not ready but worth to try",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Fun place,"Relaxed atmoshphere, beautiful plants all year round, fantastic views..
The hike up the mountain is tough, but the view is rewarding. The cable car is the easy way to go up the mountain, and the ride is smooth and comfortable.

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A secret that should be kept well.,"I was very reluctant to give this place a 5 star rating because I don't want it to become another ""hot spot"" for rude tourists from Country X to crowd around and destroy its beautiful gardens. I was lucky to visit it without much crowd when I went with my partner. We basically have the entire place to just us. The cable car ride to the top is amazing and the view of Kobe from the cable car is simply majestic. The casual stroll from the top to the middle station was filled with many nice gardens. There's one garden which grew different herbs and another which grew common vegetables (think cabbage, lettuce) and one that grew different types of roses. There is the lover's bell, a secluded spot for you and your loved one to ring the bell and pray for a lasting relationship and a foot bath which you can enjoy between the top and middle station.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Cable car and lovely gardens,"We had a day in Kobe so decided to go on the Cable car.

At the top there is a fantastic view of Kobe. There are shops and cafes and a scented herb garden. We walked down through the gardens which were interesting and saw the glasshouse also. We then took the cable car back to the base station.

We took the tram to the top where they had a German-themed festival then walked down through the gardens to the mid-mountain station and took the Gondola back to the bottom. From the Gondola you have a nice view of the waterfall and Kobe City. Would highly recommend.,"Written October 16, 2017"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A Valuable Tip,"Because of an error on my part, I didn't see much of the herb garden. The garden is located between the upper and mid- levels of the rope way. It should be entered from the upper level. That way seeing it is to follow the paths downhill as they snake through the garden. Should you choose to enter the garden at mid-level, then you will have to follow the paths uphill all the way.","Written October 11, 2017"

The gold leaves ice cream is so so (I don't like the ice cream) but do try the ice blended lemonade (I don't know the Japanese name). We went there before autumn so it's quite hot but it's okay with the herbs smell all over. We can also rent a motorized wheelchair that comes very handy for climbing up the hill for my grandma. We don't stay until night because the canteen will be closed also when we need to give the children dinner. Do soak your feet at the foot bath, it's worth it after all the walking.","Written October 3, 2017"

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great escape. Heavenly.,"This did not exist when I lived in Kobe 27 years ago. I wish it did. When I wanted to escape the bustle of the city (crowds and buildings) we drove up the winding narrow streets up the mountain. I always got car sick if I didn't take Dramamine. If it did take it, I was sound asleep by the time I got to the top.

We took this cable car trip the first day here and got several great looks at the city. Plus the temperature was very pleasant and the garden smells were heavenly.","Written September 6, 2017"

By Shinkansen Bullet Train get off at the Shin-Kobe station . It's only 5 mins on foot.

Highly recommended to take the ropeway.

The admission fares inclusive of ropeway pass for adults is1400 Yen n children priced at 700 Yen. You will see beautiful sunflowers in summer..

Enjoy delicious green tea flavoured ice cream while strolling the herb gardens .

Hop on and off the rope to get to various parts of the Herb Garden. The fragrance Museum - a wooden hall with great acoustics where a popular venue for concerts and recitals. Also historical aspects of fragrance are displayed and explained at Fragrance Museum.

Talk a walk at the beautiful Lavender Garden , not forgetting to get your cameras ready when on the ropeway. You can take beautiful pictures of the Nunobiki no Taki waterfalls .

Remember to bring your hat and have lots of sunblock on😊

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Stunning Views of Kobe,"We went there around mid day in late August. We went there from Osaka, and took the JR rapid express vs the Shinkansen to save money. But JR goes to Kobe station, and not Shin-Kobe where the Shinkansen goes to. When we got to JR Kobe Station, none of the maps were in English. So somebody pointed us downstairs to the tourist center. We got maps telling us how to get to the Herb Gardens. We took the tourist loop bus to take us from JR Kobe station to Shin-Osaka. If you buy the all day bus pass, you get a discount on the tram. We got a good views of Kobe from the bus. The bus is crowded though. Once you get to Shin-Osaka, you can see the building for the tram, to the right of the station. But getting there is the trick. Exit to the right from Shin-Osaka, and you will see a bridge to the ANA Crowne hotel. The hotel is under renovation, so it is a mess. Ignore the sign inside the hotel for the Herb Garden. Instead go to the first floor, and you will see a tiny green arrow for the Herb Garden. There is a corridor under the hotel, go through it and make a right to the elevators to the tram. There was no line to get on the tram. The tram cars are small, but if the crowds are not big, they will only fit your party into one car. So we only had two people in our car. So you can easily pick if you want to see a mountain view or a city view. Kobe is a modern city, sort of like Hong Kong with lots of high rises and a hilly terrain. So the views of the city are stunning. The herb gardens are OK. The main star are the views. As you go up, there is a mid-level stop, you can get out there or go straight to the top. If you go to the top, you can walk downhill through the gardens to the mid-level stop and then take the tram down from there. I was expecting it to be cooler up on the mountain but it was still hot and humid there.","Written August 19, 2017"

You can also get delicious full course meals with a beautiful view and German style grill food. Fresh air and a nice mountain garden walk... good for a picnic and a lazy read in some places. Can take even a half hour break if you are stressed and working in the city below... or release your stress after work. The gift shop also has quite a few nice things to buy, particularly of the spa, tea, crafts, organic snacks variety. And, for dating couples, yes... especially in the evening with all the lovely twinkling lights below... you can even sneak a private dance with your sweetie on one of the less trafficked open spaces and perhaps bring a small bottle of red and a couple of glasses for the moment up with you.","Written August 14, 2017"

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A must visit site,"This site is right next door to Shin Kobe . To access the Herb Garden, you will take a cable car which will take you to the top. There is a mid station which you can use on the way down. It was really a very pleasant surprise once you reach the top. The whole complex will take your breath away, not just for the view but for the whole package. There are many picture-worthy areas and you can spend a lot of time exploring all the activities they have for all ages.

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A pleasant way to while away the hours in Kobe,"The Kobe Nunobiki Herb Garden is accessed via a Ropeway (cable car) located behind Kobe Station. It is a 10 minute trip to the top of the mountain and provides spectacular views over Kobe, the harbour and the mountainside. There is a German styled eating area located at the top. You can take a pleasant two hour meander downhill through the herb gardens and stopping at the lovely Nunobiki waterfall. If the weather is nice it is a lovely way to while away the hours in Kobe. A warning - unless you are very fit and keen, do not be tempted to walk up the mountain as it is quite steep.","Written July 19, 2017"

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Spectacular view,"We took the ropeway all the way to the summit (a ticket only going to the halfway station, where the park is, is also available) and the view is well worth the price of admission. We went in the evening as the ropeway admission is cheaper, but that is because the park and lower gardens are close at this time.

The lift is mostly glass so that it offers a great view from all around. A panoramic view of Kobe and its expansive harbor can be observed, not to mention the view on Osaka Bay and Osaka Prefecture across from it. The operators are also kind as to let you ride up with only your friends as oppposed to complete strangers. Only during the descent will they fit as many people as possible into each lift.

At the summit there are several shops selling souvenirs, imported honey, and made in Kobe wine. There is equally a shop that specialises in fragrances. The food and beverages were a bit expensive for my liking. I would recommend bringing your own if possible. As stated earlier, as long as it isn't the evening, you can also access the gardens and the park by foot from the summit or midway point. There is also the possibilityto access them for free without the use of the ropeway, but expect a long walk in order to do so.

Overall, our experience was quite pleasing despite not being able to access the park and gardens. It is a fantastic way to escape the city and experience nature. This is a definite must visit for all those coming to Kobe.",

However, that is very dependant on the weather. During our visit, it was gloomy and cloudy on the first day and for the morning on the day of our visit, but miraculously the sky cleared up and we had a great day out. For those who can energetic, you can always walk downhill from the top to the midway station on the way back. We had four elders so walking is not an option.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,"Beautiful aromatic herbs, walk & herbal foot bath","We finally managed to get to Kobe herb gardens & it didn't disappoint. We reached it via the convenient ropeway however if you don't have a head for heights you can walk uphill instead.

I would recommend using the ropeway, you glide silently to the top. It was a clear sunny day when we went this week. The views from the top are stunning. There are places to eat, vending machines for bottles of drink, toilets & a shop for buying herb related products.

The walk down is a pleasure. If in a wheelchair there are paths to the side but we used the little steps between each level. My particular favourite was an apple mint, loved the aroma. A little further down we went into the greenhouses & found the hot herbal footbath. There are towels to hire if you need them. The footbath costs nothing & it is bliss to sit there soaking sore feet in hot herb infused water whilst enjoying the view. We didn't walk all the way down but you can. We rejoined the ropeway at mid- station & enjoyed Ano aerial view of the waterfall.

Allow a couple of hours or more to savour the experience but you could do the trip comfortably in an hour if you go up & back on the ropeway.

Would go again.","Written June 28, 2017"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Nice Garden to Wander,"This was a lovely garden to wander around. It reminded me of a mix of Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania and Lombard St in San Francisco.

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Must see Nunobiki Garden!,Take a cable car to the top with amazing views of Kobe and Osaka in the distance. At the top there are beautiful flowers and great smelling herbs to view. Have lunch at the green house terrace and eat with amazing views. You can hike down trails to a waterfall and a dam or take the cable car back down to the bottom. There are many shops and foods at the top of the mountain. Highly recommend you visit and spend a few hours here when you are in Kobe.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Beautiful,"Visited in June. First, if you are a traveler with the JR-pass make sure you take the Kobe Shinkasen Station (SHIN-KOBE) which is the station at the bottom of the herb garden. A local train will take you there as well, but you will have a 20-30 minute walk. We read the reviews below and got there right as it opened and bought a one-way pass because after the herb garden you can continue down mountain for about a 2 hour hike. The cable car ride is very pretty. The gardens were beautifully blooming (especially the fragrant roses) and everything was picturesque. Little shops at the top. Very quiet (other than loud crows). There is a foot soak area that overlooks the city of Kobe which was quite lovely. It was hot day! We enjoyed some vanilla and lavender soft serve ice cream which was very good. I recommend bringing water and sunscreen for the trek down the mountain. There is some shade, but it is very open to the sunlight for the plants.

After you are done in the gardens, you can either take the cable car down or hike down the mountain.
We choose to hike down the mountain. The beginning of the hike is a treacherous steep dirt pathway with a lot of places to twist ankles or tweak knees. I don't recommend the hike to anyone that has trouble with foot, ankle or knee problems (falling into the category of foot/plantars facia issues I was dying after the walk down from the gardens) because after the gardens it is a local trail and it very isolated. The paved (at times) path continues to be various gradients of steepness as well.

Nevertheless, I wanted to continue and see the nature and the beautiful mountain side. Well, it was worth it! It is a beautiful path that goes by the dam and (if I wasn't hurting so much from walking/hiking) you can even take the path to the waterfall. It was a hot day! I cannot stress enough to bring water if you are going to take on this adventure. I cannot say that I would ever make the climb up the mountain as a part of my next trip to the Herb Gardens/Nunobiki trail, but I would definitely take the cable car up and hike down and perhaps see the waterfall up close. Bring better shoes...and more water.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Relaxing and beautiful experience,"The Kobe Nenobiki Herb Garden is a beautiful experience. It starts with a cable car ride up a beautiful hill and then at the top of the hill you will be treated to amazing views of the cities of Kobe and Osaka! There are botanical gardens to meander through and a relaxing path to a greenhouse. I'm not usually into visiting gardens, but this place was amazing!",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great views high above the city and Osaka Bay,A very pleasant trip up the Ropeway (Cable Car) to the visitor center and start of the botanical gardens and the walk down. A very nice afternoon in and around the gardens high above Kobe and the Osaka bay.,"Written June 4, 2017"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,One of the must go attraction in Kobe!,"Even though it's called an herb garden, there were also various flowers there. During my visit, all the flowers were in full bloom except roses. There were already some flowers that were already wilting (but I'm not complaining because maybe it was time for them to wilt).

The landscape of the place is so that you can get on the cable car to go up the hill and also walk down to the bottom station at the same time. As you descend up the cable car, you will see a view of the whole of Kobe city but be sure to get ready to see a view of the Nunobiki Falls to your left. On the top station, there is a herb shop and a little cafe that you can enjoy. As you walk down you will see a glass house. The glass house also has a cafe that you can enjoy. They also sell lavender ice cream at a little shop just before you get to the middle cable car station too!

My friends and I spent around 4 hours at this place and we still couldn't get enough of it! We actually spent too much time here that we didn't have enough time to explore other parts of Kobe. If that's not enough to convince you to make a visit, I don't know what will! We enjoyed it so much!",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great place to visit,"After few days of visiting cities, temples and shrines this was an amazing break.

We took the gondola ( rope way) up and walked down on the hiking tracks which was amazing as we could see all the gardens and the waterfall.

Be prepared to walked couple of hours though.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,good place for a romantic walk/chill/hike!,"Went there in may, lots of different kinds of flowers, many benches to sit on too. there was a large field where i think you can have a picnic at, while watching the sunset. perfect setting. you could also sit in the shade under the plants and look at the city.
pretty nice place, hike if you have the time as you will pass by the waterfalls and a small dam, with a few streams from the top of the mountain.
at the top of herb garden is like an european kind of restaurant/with shops selling flower seeds (if im not wrong,)etc. you will reach this areaa first if you are taking the ropeway, then have a nice hike down!
pretty nice!","Written June 1, 2017"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Must do Attraction,"Spend a few hours here to kill time before our early evening flight and it was well worth it.

Beautiful rose garden at the top with plenty of places to eat and drink. Enjoy a herbal footbath at the greenhouse section. It such a large area looked after so well with many flowers that I hadn't seen for years. A lovely, happy experience.","Written June 1, 2017"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Lavender ice cream!,"Here at the highest point of Kobe, also marked one of the highlights of the trip.
We spent a good part of the late morning here enjoying brunch and ice cold, locally brewed beer.

Near to the train station and a scenic cable car ride, it was easy enough to travel here by public transport.

Take a leisurely 2hr walk down the side of the hill and wander through the various herb gardens. Lots of photo opp!
And just before you reach the mid-way cable car station, you will be rewarded with a lavender ice cream truck!!!",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Scenic view,"Beautiful place with scienic view on Kobe. You can either go by cable car or walk an easy hiking trail. Close to the cable car station there are some crowded restaurants and shops, but as soon as I walked down the gardens it was very quiet. You can see lots of flowers and herbs (outside and in greenhouses). It's a perfect place to enjoy a sunny day.","Written May 28, 2017"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Nice view with the Gondola ride,"That is the best part of our trip. We did not realize that it is just next to the train station, 10 min walk to the entrance. And then you have to walk up the hill to the station -- that is another 10 min. Fortunately, the ride and the view is nice, probably nicer than at the top. Our time is tight so we just take the gondola down again. They do allow that.","Written May 24, 2017"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Breathtaking view,"The view from Nunobiki Herb garden is fantastic!
But the best part is getting out of a city center with a short ride in on the ropeway get you out to nature in no time.

The arrangement of the herb garden is very nice and and lots of stuff to learn.
the palm and butterfly hose on top is also need.

If you walk the short trip back down you will pass the nunobiki Waterfall which is very soothing in the summer heat.","Written May 24, 2017"

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Go early in the morning for the best day,"we arrived at 9.30am from Osaka to visit . We had gone 2 days earlier during golden week and the queue was miles long so decided to go early on a weekday and weren't disappointed. The views are spectacular and for anyone who loves gardens this is the place to see it. We went straight to the top in the cable cars then walked back down through the gardens to the midway station and caught the car back up again for some light lunch. Not all food places are open during the week but you can grab a bite to eat with a beer if you like. Then we caught the car back down. The walk throughout the gardens is amazing with so many different types of plants and even vegetables. It is quite steep in some places but take your time. There is also free wheelchair hire for people to access the gardens. You cannot use a manual chair because of the steepness but hey, they give you and electric one to enjoy the place. A really great place to visit if you go to Japan and like gardens instead of temples.","Written May 21, 2017"

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,You just HAVE to visit this place,"This herb garden is a must if you visit Kobe. It is located very close to JR Shin-Kobe station and you will not miss it since they put alot of sigange just after you exit the station. It is a great place for you to see Cherry blossom and my wife and I were lucky enough to some in our visit. The rope way is a convenient way to go up and if you like hiking it is recommended that you buy 1 way ticket and then walk your way down. To enjoy the ropeway, sight seeing, the shops, and the walk down you need to allocate at least arround 4 hours. Don't forget to bring some necessary items for the walk in the woods. By walking you can see the Nunobiki waterfalls.
If you dislike long walking just buy the two-way ticket.
The garden is not in Japanese style but you can see lots of variety of flowers. The staff are friendly and the staff at the entrance can speak a little English. If you want to buy some gifts, you can visit the entrance area and I recommend you to buy the Kobe Herb Gardens Original soap.
Make sure you check the closing time at the entrance if you come to ensure that you know when to depart back down. They use a loud speaker with such a low volume that you might not notice that they announcing the closing time, and you will not want to miss the ropeway.
Just a must Spot to visit in Kobe.","Written May 13, 2017"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Don't bother if you only make the evening session,"We arrived quite late, so had to wait for the evening session which begins at 5pm. Sadly, this only allows you to walk around the small section at the top of the cable car, which takes about 20 minutes. We really wanted to walk down through the beautiful gardens, which you can only do if you make the daytime session.
This attraction would definitely have a higher rating if we'd made the full day session, as the gardens and hike down looked stunning from the cable car. I would advise if you can only make it there after 5pm, to seriously consider going another time or missing this out as your experience is very limited unfortunately","Written May 11, 2017"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Worth the effort,"Visited on a Monday after the Golden Week. It was such a relaxing place to be. You will also get to enjoy a panoramic view of the entire Kobe city. The cable car ride was enjoyable as you will get to experience the city view from different vantage points when the cable car ascends and descends.

The botanicals were also a sight to behold. Many were painstakingly manicured.

Overall, it was an enjoyable trip especially if you are a fan of nice botanical gardens.","Written May 8, 2017"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Nice day trip from Kyoto,"We went to Kobe as a day trip and to see something different to Kyoto. Fortunately it was a beautiful day and the rope way, herb garden and walk through the park were just lovely. The faux European feel of the shops and cafes is a bit tacky, but the view from the top was fabulous - especially when experienced while enjoying a herbal foot bath! The café food was nice too. The garden was pretty and pleasant to walk through and we met some lovely locals while we were there. We stayed in the garden much longer than we had planned and also enjoyed the rest of our Kobe visit wanderings.","Written May 6, 2017"

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,lovely,"The ropeway isn't too far from shin-kobe station. We used the city loop bus which stops right in front.

A round trip costs about 1100 JPY per person and we enjoyed it too. We decided to do that because it was at the end of our day and it was very rainy.
The herb garden is fun for a walk. The herbs do smell lovely. You come up and see olden european style buildings. Looked beautiful. Because of the rain and mist we couldn't see over Kobe, but I read the view is really amazing.
There is also a fragrance museum on top (Morino Hall). It was interesting to experience all those base scents.

Next time we will pick a sunny day to go there to see the view and we will walk down from the top to the bottom or middle stop of the ropeway. Really curious about the whole garden.","Written May 1, 2017"

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,"Wonderfully designed Garden , good to combine into a Mt Maya hike","The garden uses the mountainside beautifully. This makes the small themed gardens and the greenhouse halfway up very special. The Bavarian style houses and music on top are a little funny but okay. The views down to the city are great, so best walk down/cablecar up .

I combined it with Mt Maya and the nunobiki waterfalls into a nice 6 hrs hike (could be made less using the cable cars). Walking up from cable car valley station to Mt Maya (approximately 500 m ascent), 2 hrs. Over to the gardens. Signposts okay if you use the maps that stand around . Mainly descent, sometimes slippery, bring decent shoes. About an hour down to the JR station but allow half an hour detour for the waterfalls.","Written April 29, 2017"

The view from this spot is actually nice.","Written April 23, 2017"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A great way to get an overview of Kobe City and the beautiful gardens,"Easily accessible, the ropeway is a 5-minute walk from the Shin-Kobe Railway station. At the top of the hill you enter your enclosed glass car and head up to the top station all the while getting a panoramic view of the Kobe Harbor. When reaching the top station a replica of a European Village greets you. Here you can walk around, gaze at the beautiful flowers or grab a cappuccino and a bite to eat at the café. Visit the Fragrance Museum on top for some olfactory delight!
You can spend a few hours walking around admiring the view and the flowers in season. The Gardens offer a round trip ropeway ticket for about 1400Yen or for half price you can take the ropeway up and walk down the paths to the bottom.","Written April 22, 2017"

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,"Great view, nice area at the top.","I didn't actually stop at the middle station with the herb garden as I went in the evening after the garden and mid station were closed. But going up on the ropeway is a fun trip, with amazing views, focusing on the views helped me temporarily ignore my fear of heights.

The area at the top has some cafes etc, as well as some nice buildings, live music was being played in the theatre, and the view is great as well, seeing out over Kobe and just getting a glimpse of Osaka on the horizon. Though I believe the view at Mt Maya is better, this is easier to get to as the station is next to Shin-Kobe station, rather than 30 minutes bus ride out of the city, so it's good if you have limited time in Kobe.

When the sun goes down the buildings up top are lit up in a nice purple hue, and you get a great view of the city lights, though can't quite see Kobe Tower & that area until your on the ropeway down.",

Once on Top You can walk around and explore the many little gardens around the very European looking complex.

A good alternative to Kobe city if you miss the greenery.","Written April 14, 2017"

While there were many beds of herbs most (in mid April) were still pretty dormant. I expected to be overwhelmed with beautiful spring flowers but beyond tulips there were very few flower beds.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Quaint European Feel,"The Herb Garden is really a complex of European-style buildings with different kinds of gardens with something to see each season; a greenhouse; and various plant and fragrance themed exhibits. We took a gondola ride all the way up, which has a nice view of the city. On our way back, we walked halfway down, strolling through the different gardens. It was so refreshing to be surrounded by all the trees and greenery. Coming from Canada, the Herb Garden was nice but not too special. If you are interested in European buildings, plants, and fragrances then it's a nice place to spend the afternoon.","Written April 13, 2017"

Japan,Moerenuma Park,A lot to experience,"Visited with family

Pros:
1) This park can be reached via train and bus. Ensure to read and understand the directions carefully because it can be confusing.
2) Best to visit with a full stomach and bring some drinks and snacks. My family and I visited right before lunch, luckily there was a small cafe inside the park which was quite a walk from the main entrance.
3) There is a bike rental a few meters from the entrance. Suggest to rent one. The park is huge and easier to cycle than walk.
4) There were many attractions to visit but my favorite is the pyramid-shaped museum and cycling around the park.
5) Allot 1 whole day or at least half day to visit. It closes around 5pm so best to start early.
6) It is definitely child-friendly.
7) Best toilet to use is at the pyramid-shaped museum.
8) Wear something comfortable since this is an outdoor place.

The only con I can think of is the insects that appeared around 5pm on the way to the bus station. It was similar to the insects we experienced at the Shiroi Koibito Park.

We underestimated our time. We came to the park around 4pm and by the time we walked up to the top of the hill, it was sunset already. The walk up was around 20 minutes. It was dark and everything was closed by the time we came down.

The view was amazing at the top as you can see the skyline of downtown Sapporo with the snow mountains in the background. It was a bit chilly too due to the icy winds.","Written November 30, 2019"

You can rent a bike for 300 yen per 2 hours to cycle around this big site. The bicycle station is nearby a car parking lot. When I visited this park, it was a sunny day and I could enjoy walking in the great fresh air. Most of the visitors were families with kids. Some of them were playing with a kite.

Japan,Moerenuma Park,One of a kind park,"Wonderful, unique park dedicated to a talented artist.

But even for those unfamiliar with him, the park can be enjoyed for the natural surroundings, views from high places (hilltops and the top of the glass pyramid), and the Sea Fountain. For the Sea Fountain, don’t expect a Bellagio water show. It’s an hour display where the water changes but in intended ways that require you to “see”. His work wants you to appreciate nature and examine the beauty often unseen or taken for granted. We spent a couple of hours there and could easily have spent more time.

Japan,Moerenuma Park,Beyond fantastic!,"The highlight of my trip to Sapporo. What a thoughtfully built park which engages all your senses!
This is not to be missed even thought it is not easy to get to and not very clear to get instructions on either.

I would recommend a taxi but given that Taxis are super expensive, I still used the map given to me by the tourist information centre which marked the subway line and bus to take. The bus did not have English names displayed for the stops which leaves you to navigate by maps - also tricky this since Google maps does not fully cover the smaller bus stops in Hokkaido area.
I did get off at the wrong stop, but still managed to make it to this place on a rather rainy cold day. But worth it!

The cherry blossom forest was in full bloom which was beautiful. There are play hills to go up and come down from, play areas with equipment. The glass pyramid is gorgeous from inside and up top to take in the 360 degree view of the park. I saw the sunset as well here which was fabulous.
The hills over a very beautiful vantage point to see the sunset from and enjoy the city around you.

But for me, as I was travelling with my 2 kids, action is more important than sightseeing. In Moerenuma Park, there are 2 slopes for them to climb and roll on. We all had so much fun!

We visited the Glass Pyramid and the access to the observatory was available. There wasn’t much visitors, on my count, probably less than 10. The Glass Pyramid gives a good night view of the surrounding areas though not as fabulous as that of Mt Hakodate.

Plusses are the fountain and wading pool in summer and cherry blossoms in spring.

The location is a bit off the main Sapporo downtown requiring subway and then a 30 minute bus ride, but well worth the visit.","Written May 24, 2017"

Japan,Moerenuma Park,Poor experience due to overwhelming snow,"Was very excited to explore the park as it has such amazing reviews and is so well-designed. Because it was winter, was not expecting the bicycle renting experience, but was at least hoping to see a beautiful winter landscape. However, we went on a MONDAY, which is when the park is closed, including the bicycle rental service and glass pyramid centre, which was already a big disappointment in itself. The bigger disappointment is that the park is not maintained in winter so the entire landscape was covered in at least 40cm of snow. Travelling 100m into the park already felt like a chore that wasn't worth the effort.

DO NOT go in winter and if you do, plan very very well. Best to ask locals or service staff for suggestions if possible. The park was not designed for winter, which is a poor testament to the designer.","Written May 16, 2017"
Japan,Moerenuma Park,lovely to walk and view the glass pyramidal structure,"The design of the park by Isamu Noguchi is intriguing.

Japan,Moerenuma Park,Pictures don't do it justice,"Looking at pictures beforehand, it looks like just a nice park, maybe worth an hour on a lazy afternoon. But in person it's just beautiful. The scale is hard to grasp through pictures alone, and I wish we'd spent a little more time there. It definitely makes sense that they rent bicycles.

The park is very family-friendly, with lots of artsy playgrounds scattered around the park. There are lots of open grounds where people play sports and eat lunch. The cherry blossoms were great, too, and not nearly as busy as other parks.

You snow most of the time and greens in Sapporo. But this one, entirely about the mood that you going to perceive depends on the current weather. I felt like I am in a different zone. I couldn't rremember how i get there, my review may not be helpful, but perhaps I give you a little idea that this place is worth a visit, if you are someone, who appreciate the effort that put in a work as a designer/ artist.",

Since it was a holiday when we visited, there are only a few people there so we are able to explore and take nice photos. Downside is that the park is closed on holidays and we were not able to rent sleds and play in that big hill in the middle. But we enjoyed looking at the kids who did.

Some tips though, taxis can be too expensive to go there on your own. We noted that there were no public transportation in sight so we asked the taxi to wait for us. The best option maybe is to go on a tour buses - you can go to the JR Station and inquire from there.

Wish I could say more, but we have limited experience in this place.",
Japan,Moerenuma Park,Great place to relax in city.,"Took some effort to climb the hill, the scene on the hill is definitely worth for a climb. A good place for the nature lover, family, and for those who love to walk in nature. Enjoy the fountain breeze in this city park.",
Japan,Moerenuma Park,winter frolic,"If your vacation is mainly in the city, it's good to get out here in the open and away from the traffic. The big hill in the middle is good for views and sledding- and we saw a guy climb to the top and ski down. The last 100 meters is actually fairly steep (though not dangerous, I'd say) so you can get some good speed on the harder, windblown snow before you plunge into the softer stuff halfway down.
Snack bar is closed in winter. Your choices are a fancy restaurant or vending machines with hot drinks, soup, and energy bars.
The subway doesn't come out here so you'll have to drive or take the bus (details in another post), which is easy but you could hit traffic on the way back and it's slow going, so bring a book and ignore the yapping after-school teens.","Written December 26, 2016"
Japan,Moerenuma Park,It is great place to visit.,"If you like art, it is great place to visit. This park was originally designed by Mr.Isamu Noguchi, who was a famous Japanese-American artist. The main building, glass pyramid, and large designed constructions can be found there. These are really warm and peaceful. The space is really large and open sky, thus it is really comfortable when the weather is good in sunny days. The place is a little bit far from the center city. The public transportation is only a bus service from center city and not convenient. It is best to use a rental car. The park is beside a park ""Sapporo Sato-land"".

On my trip it was a cloudy day, which actually made the visit quite pleasant as it was cool enough to comfortably traverse the park several times.

Japan,Moerenuma Park,Wide-open & beautiful :),"With meticulously-maintained lawns, neatly-kept clusters of trees (like small groves or woods) and beautiful tree-lined paths, I would say with no exaggeration at all that this is one of the best parks I have been to in my life. And yes, there's also the big glass pyramid to go inside for a break (with seats but not sure about availability of food; and I'll just have to say the biggest let-down there was that it wasn't air-conditioned, so it was pretty hot inside that big glass pyramid), Mt. Moere with a fairly great 360-degree view from above (can see downtown Sapporo to the southwest from up there) which only takes about five minutes or so from the bottom with stairs on two sides, the big water fountain inside a circle of trees or a circular-shaped forest, the smaller Play Mountain (no stairs to go up though), and some big sculptures like a big circular tub & an open-sided pyramid (just a short distance north of Mt. Moere). But above all, I was just mostly impressed by the wide-open ground that was ""so clean & perfectly maintained"".

The subway from Odori Station in downtown to Kanjo Dori Higashi Station in the north on Toho Line takes only about ten minutes, but with getting upstairs & waiting for the bus (just outside the subway station on one of its sides) and the bus ride itself (which takes about half an hour to the south entrance of the Park), it will take you about an hour in total from downtown to get to the Park. But yes, while in Sapporo, it's ""absolutely"" worth it to come to this park despite its out-of-the-way location.",

I'd say it's a very great place to take a family for a picnic or day of relaxation. Not so great for a traveller looking for great scenery or exciting climbs.

The weather was a sunny 15 degrees.

The park was simply magnificent. Its huge, and comprises of different sections each with its own flavour and fun for kids and adults. We climbed Mt Moere and it was incredibly windy up there, but worth the trek for the amazing view of the area. Because we also wanted to go to Satoland, we didn't explore the entire park, but did go to the viewing gallery and to the small Noguchi exhibit on the 2nd floor.

Japan,Moerenuma Park,Open expanse,"I had thought that Tokino Suzuran Park was wide and big; so is Moerenuma. The similarity ends here though. A few, huge sculptures and two (man made?) hills filled the big expanse of green spaces of Moerenuma Park. From a certain point within the park, the view looks like a copy of MS Windows wall paper, or did Microsoft copied this? The designer did an excellent job making this park likeable as well as useable. The sculptures blends in well with the rolling grassy plains broken up by several patches of wooded areas and the two hills. The creative idea of mass planting different species (e.g. evergreen or decidous) in different patches of wooded areas subtly breaks the monotony of the green surrounding.

Lovely place to spend a couple of hours easily!","Written April 28, 2016"

A very long bus ride is the only way to get there (try to search online on what bus number) and since the bus stop announcements are only in Japanese, try to ask the bus driver for directions (have someone write the park name in Japanese) and they would gladly help. The park itself is breath taking (also literally since it is huge and walking around would take your breath away), unusual, and obviously made an artist. A very good advice would be to rent a bicycle (just beside one of the gates) so that you can explore the whole park. Though the park would take half a day of your time, our family did not regret it.

It's close on Mondays though so you have to time your visit because it would suck to go all the way to the park just to see snow. Nonetheless, I had fun at the park.

The entire park is considered a sculpture but there are several 'attractions' within the park itself. The most prominent is Mt Moere, a man made mountain rising 62m, there's a smaller hill famous for its white path contrasting with the deep green of the surrounding grass which leads to the 30m high summit. The symbol of the park is the glass pyramid. There are large expanses of grass which are popular spots for locals to sit down and enjoy the sunshine.
You can spend the best part of an afternoon here but it is a bit difficult to get to by bus, you may need to ask someone for help but generally you should take the subway to Kanjō-Dōri-Higashi Station and then the 69 or 79 bus to the park.

Upon exit up the stairs, turn right and about 30-40m from there on the right is the bus terminal. Take Chuo Bus 69/79 to the Park's East entrance. Entrance on the bus on from the back down and grab a ticket. Exit from the front and pay there. If in doubt, check with the bus driver, they are really professional and helpful.

We rented our bicycles at the entrance-this is a great option to cover the entire place. They have all types of bikes of people of all ages. They also come with locks so that you can make a stop, climb the hills, enjoy the various attractions without worry that your bike will be rode away.

We spent about 2-3 hours at the park...a little short and longer would have been better. However, with bicycles, we managed to make our way throughout the park from a clockwise route. Tennis Centre to the breath-taking views from Mt. Moere; Tetra Mound; Play Mountain; Beach; Playground, Fountain and the Glass Pyramid.

When in Sapporo next, we will certainly make our way back to this magnificent park.","Written July 7, 2014"
Japan,Moerenuma Park,Emptiest Sightseeing Location Ever,"We absolutely loved this park. It is about a one hour ride from the city and I have to state up front that I don't think it is for everybody. It's a massive park with truly gigantic 'sculptures' designed by the famous Japanese-American artists. We were somewhat familiar with his work/ideas which helped... However since his work is very abstract and aesthetically pleasing anybody can enjoy without knowing anything about his art or art in general. It's a place to wander around in, to simply let it take you and to ride the crazy thought waves that informed it. At the same time it feels like a crazily failed experiment, to build this park far away from the main city, and for it not really offer the typical park-experience, you know, benches to sit on, a picnic space, these things. It's reminded me of some of the Japanese modern classics most notably Kobo Abe. We visited this park in May 2014 and although it was quite sunny with some clouds the wind was strong and it was definitely chilly. It added to the atmosphere; the wind-swepped ruggedness of the place... Curious to see what looks like covered ins now.","Written May 16, 2014"
Japan,Moerenuma Park,Worth the effort to visit and take time to breathe,"We had some free time in the afternooon and were eager to visit this park designed by a well known sculptor in Japan. Eventhough early April is not a very ideal time to enjoy the space(the grounds are quite saturated with melting snow), we were not disappointed! The whole park is a sculpture itself with many lovely areas to enjoy the open air. It was practically empty when we were there,no doubt, because of the time of year. Still, we were inspired and enjoyed a couple hours wakling around and visiting the glass pyramid, which has a charming French restaurant and cafe. We splurged on our way there and took a taxi, which was about 4,200 Yen from the city center. On the way back, we took Bus # 6, which took us back to the bus center just near the communications tower at Odori Park. Much much cheaper!
This is a perfect place, weather permitting, to pack a picnic lunch and a good book and head out to explore and enjoy. Some people might get all the way out there and feel there is not much really going on....I think that is the very reason to go! Food options are limited.","Written April 7, 2014"
Japan,Moerenuma Park,Very big and beatiful park,I went to the park in a Saturday and even it was in weekend it wasn't very crowded. If you rent a bike it will be easier to travel inside of the park. The price of one hour rent is 100 yen. You can also take your tent and have a little camp for the day. There is also a little lake in this park that you can take off your shoes and get inside but it is very shallow that the level of water doesn't pass your knee. Don't forget to climb to the mountain and see the beautiful view of Sapporo city. And also there is a very big fountain which makes a show every hour. You should also see the glass pyramid. It was a very interesting building. Finally if you love to play tennis you can rent some tennis rackets and balls and spend your time by playing tennis.,

Japan,Moerenuma Park,Interesting Sculpture parc outside Sapporo,"The Moerenuma Park is located north east of Sapporo not so convenient to reach. From the Sapporo station you can take the bus number 59 to the last station. From there it si a 10minutes walk.

The Park offers a great combination of sculptures, which are actually more buildings than sculptures, and possibilities for picknick and playground for children. Founded and designed by Isamu Noguchi on the ground of a former waste treatment plant in 1988, there are about 10 major structures, which are perfectly designed in harmony with the landscape: mountains, rivers, fountains and the landmark glass pyramid. There are many lawns and water places which are ideal to sit on or play in on hot summer days for the whole family.

From the play mountain and the amphitheatre you will have a very nice view of the distant Sapporo skyline.

To go around you might rent a bike for 300Y per person which is a very convenient way of seeing all exhibits.

Despite the fact that it takes some time to reach this place, I recommend this as a very nice and inspiring trip.","Written July 28, 2013"
Japan,Moerenuma Park,Surprisingly fun,"I thought the design/architecture sounded interesting enough to warrant the roughly one hour of subway and bus travel to warrant going, but we ended up staying longer and had a great time. This is the opposite of an electronic arcade; you make your own fun. The hills, glass pyramid and fountains are a feast for the eyes and as KanoSouthCarolina says, the people watching is fun. You can stretch your legs on a rental bike $2 for 2 hours (free park admission) and it's fun to make a circuit or two on the 4 km perimeter bike path. Don't miss the sea fountain... I don't want to post a spoiler but I've never seen a fountain do what it does. It starts at 15 after the hour during summer months and lasts 40 minutes. Stay past the big initial geyser. Food choices were really limited; bring snacks. The whole park is sculpture and very cool.

The Tohu subway line from Sapporo station has English signs and it's just 3 stops out. The bus pulls up right outside and -again - it has a sign in English as well as an English announcement. You won't get lost.","Written July 24, 2013"
Japan,Moerenuma Park,Lovely Park,"We rented bikes to cycling around the park to save time and really enjoyed it. Beautiful landscape. Could not believe that this place used to be garbage dump site. The fountain show is nice and not to be missed.

Japan,Moerenuma Park,What a mini snowstorm,"After I came back from my trip to Moerenuma Park, I shared with the hotel front desk abut my experience & she laughed. It seems that Sapporo citizens know about Moerenuma's desolate & forlorn winter, not the tourists. Here's why: - (1) Strong wind picking up & lifting snow off the ground & into your face so you could not open your eyes, especially if you are walking in a direction that is opposite to the wind, (2) Deep snow that reached almost all the way to your knees. This is terrible if you are not wearing winter boots that reach all the way to your knees. (3) It was almost deserted when I went; the only people I saw were those inside the Glass Pyramid & those playing snow sleigh on the hill in front of the Glass Pyramid. The rest of the park was deserted, well almost. The further you walk away from the Glass Pyramid, the deeper the snow got. So you find your feet suddenly sinking deeply into the snow. I think this is because hardly anyone walks around in winter, so the snow just accummulated & accummlated. Now can you imagine what will happen if you got stuck in the deep snow? Nobody is going to come to your rescue.

I only went to 3 attractions, out of the many there - Glass Pyramid, Moerenuma Mountain & Tetra Mound. I did not manage to go near Tetra Mound because the snow was too deep. What a pity.

If you need to use the toilet, use it all you want inside the Glass Pyramid because once you are outside, there is no freaking toilet in the freezing cold. Oh, all the eateries are closed (!) during winter. So you gotta bring your own food. And bring plenty because one tends to burn more calories during winter. Otherwise, the only food will be the hot potato potage from the vending machine.","Written January 17, 2013"

Japan,Moerenuma Park,Lucky Japanese. You have such a beautiful park,"To go there, just follow the instructions on their website . The bus stop returning to the subway is across the street from where you get off. Do check the timetable before you enter the park, as you may spend hours in there. You can rent a bike, though we walk. If you hate the sun, don't come here. There is almost no shelter except when you are in the main building, the pyramid. If you don't like to walk, don't come here. In particular, climbing the 2 hills are lot of fun. You can buy simple food from the small cafeteria. But why don't you bring along some food and picnic on their seas of grass? We lunched at their French restaurant. 3 choices of set menu, the cheapest around US$90 each. Excellent french food, a 1/2 star Michelen standard. No reservation needed as we were there on a weekday. Otherwise, do reserve a table. It's worth the money.","Written September 18, 2011"
Japan,Moerenuma Park,Great huge outdoor area for families with children of all ages!,"A lovely modern park designed by a famous half British, half Japanese designer. Has huge outdoor spaces with soft lawn that kids seem to love to roll on, plus a wading pool for kids to jump around in, while the parents sprawl out on the surrounding grass watching over them. There is so much space, kids can play football and run around happily without having to disturb other people.

It's completely man made, but beautifully done, with plenty of green all around. It's about a 30 min drive from the JR station in a taxi which adds up to about JPY3600 per way.

They have a souvenir shop, a tiny museum including some info about the designer and a restaurant that one needs to book a table at, at least one day in advance (both lunch and dinner are served there). Otherwise there is also a small fast food place selling soft cream cones and other snack items (need to buy a ticket from a vending machine and then bring the ticket to the counter to retrieve your items).

The wonderful thing is that you can rent bicycles there, including ones with baskets in front (between the handle bars) for infants or other bikes with toddler seats. It costs JPY300 for 2 hours.

Many families brought little tents with them (can be bought in toys r us) or blankets and had picnics on the lawn, while keeping cool.

Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,"Lovely, peaceful garden","Visited here during the new year period. It was very beautiful and peaceful (even in the rain). I imagine it would be stunning during the spring and autumn seasons, however even in the winter it was still lovely. I believe normally you pay an entrance fee, however the day we visited, admission was free.","Written January 3, 2020"
Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Beautiful in the day and at night too,"We went twice- during the day we covered the place walking through the gardens and visited again for night illuminations. Absolutely delightful and fascinating. Must visit if in Kansai area. It is best to combine with a visit to the castle which is adjacent. There are plenty of buses to Kanazawa station area, hence best to stay in the station area and visit the gardens as there are not many things to do after closing time of gardens and not many food options in the area in the evenings.","Written January 2, 2020"
Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Pick your season,"I think our visit to Kenrokuen was ill-timed: it was too cold for anything to be in bloom but not cold enough to be covered in snow.

We spend 2 hrs and wished we could spend more time due to the cold wet weather due to winter.

It was about 8 degrees when we werue there. We sought refuge in one of the restaurants and had hot lunch. Restaurants accept cash only.

The lunch was good and we were served hot tea in the cold weather.

There were 4 to 5 restaurants at the entrance of the garden and within the premises. Umbrellas were also sold in the shops due to the wet weather.

A place not to be missed when in Kanazawa.",
Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Beautiful,"The Kenrokuen is a lovely place to just walk around and enjoy nature. I reckon if you were a writer in need of inspiration, you could sit in one of its peaceful areas and get some inspiration! It's so beautiful - no wonder it was one of the three most beautiful Japanese gardens!

Tip: wear walking shoes. There are some uneven terrain in there so keep that in mind. I did find some areas to be wheelchair-friendly.","Written December 21, 2019"

The beautiful old pines and all the care one can see in their preservation, combined with the autumn colors of the other trees, the water streams and the bridges surrounding you create a unique experience. The evening illumination felt just like a festival, there was this happy and excited vibe, little stalls selling cakes and tea.",

Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Autumn leaves visit 2019,"Absolutely astounding views of various quantities, forms and colours of abundantly bright red, yellow and gold leaves throughout this vast park.
The only problem - in my view at least - is that the park and its remarkable layout and design is so popular that this alone attracts too many visitors per day for everyone to get a real chance of glimpsing any of its gems rather than the thousands of other guests milling around.
Back home we have an old expression saying that ‘you cannot see the forrest for trees...’ which comes to mind here.

The gardens also house artists at work.
This garden should be a must see for all tourists visiting Japan.",
Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,"Yup, one of the top gardens in Japan.","Over 40 years ago, I dragged my husband to this garden and loved it. When my son wanted to go the contemporary art museum (which was awesome), we walked through Kenrokuen Garden and loved the aesthetic care that gardeners were constructing around the most vulnerable trees. It is a classical garden and free and so well curated.","Written November 30, 2019"
Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Well worth the time required,"Kenrokuen Gardens are magnificent in autumn! Interestingly, on November 1 the gardeners begin protecting the plants from heavy winter snows to come. For trees a tall pole is erected alongside the tree’s bole, and ropes are tied from it to individual branches. In the case of azalea bushes and hedges, woven ropes are tied around the perimeter to keep the branches from collapsing.
The surface of the ground is completely covered in a number of species of mosses and liverworts. One discovers that a fountain that spurts a single jet of water is fed by gravity from a small lake situated gigher on the hill such that the jet of water shoots up to the water level of its mother lake.

It seems quite a few high end restaurants are also closed on Weds. We spent about 2-3 hours enjoying the gardens.",

Walking further we came to the Hisagoike pond , midoritaki waterfall and the Kasumigaike pond. We took lovely photos of the fountain and Kotojitoro lantern reflected on the pond. The highlight of the park is the unique Karasakinomatsu pine with ropes tied to its branches. Nice Hanamibashi bridge to look out for. The trees and plants in the park is well maintained and nice to look at - the plum grove, the pine trees. There are many rest areas where one can sit to rest the aching legs or visit the Shiguretei tea house. Look out for the rest area shaped like a boat. Was a really nice walk in the cool day , amidst all the greens.",

Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Absolutely amazing in autumn!!,"If you have the JR Rail Pass (I used the Japan-wide one), you can board the JR bus for free at the bus terminal at Kanazawa Station to reach here. The bus stops at the Ishikawa Gate of the Kanazawa Castle Park; just cross the road and walk up the bit of slope to reach the entrance to Kenrokuen. Because the garden is very famous, I recommend heading in early in the morning, otherwise you’ll be greeted with long queues at admission, or even queues for taking pictures with the autumn colours! It’s really not that hard to see why so many people visit the garden though, the place is stunningly beautiful, and even more so with bright autumn colours!! If you have limited time, make a beeline for the water bodies in the garden; they make some of the most scenic spots for photography. Kanazawa is also famous for its edible gold leaf soft-serve, which you can get here as well outside the admission gate, but it is pricier compared to the other shops selling them back at Kanazawa Station, bear that in mind! I visited on 24th November 2018, which was when Kanazawa was reported to be at peak for autumn colours; putting it here so that you can gauge and plan your visit. Enjoy the sights at one of Japan’s Big Three!! It is worth it.",

Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,We prefer the garden for sakura rather than for momiji,"We visited the garden again on our koyo trip after enjoying it in cherry blossom season. We didn’t spend nearly as much time wandering around as we did in spring and the garden was not nearly as crowded as it was in April.

There were some bits of color here and there on the maples, but it was not at peak when we visited. If it had been peak, this would probably be a very different review! The trees reflecting in the pond did make for good photo ops. They were compromised though, by the fact that the boat house was under cover for restoration. With a little work, we could manage to shoot the pond and avoid the tarpaulins.

The most interesting thing and the big gift of the day were the snow cords and wrappings of the trees to protect them from the winter snow. These winter maypoles made for terrific photos and the many trees wrapped this way gave us lots to photograph.

We ate at the same food stall near the entrance. We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch of ramen while sipping Ramune in the out of doors.

Entrance was free as we visited on a holiday.

Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Beautiful garden,"One of the must see gardens in Japan. Stunning garden with beautiful lake, magnificent tress and moss gardens.

Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Appreciating a Japanese Garden,"When we think of a garden, it must be colorful with plenty of flowers to look at. Not so the Japanese and Chinese. Gardens are create with peace and tranquility in mind. There must be the elements of water, rocks and empty spaces. Designs are such that one feel at peace as you walk through the garden and reflect on yourself. Kenrokuen is one such garden and reckon to be one of the top in Japan. Well maintained, one could simply just wander around and get lost in the many different portion of the garden and yet would not be anxious to want to find your way out. Kenrokuen has my vote as a place to go to to free your mind and reflect on your life. I would totally recommend that anyone visiting Kenrokuen must bear this in mind and understand the philosophy and design elements of the garden when visiting this site","Written August 2, 2019"

Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Pine trees on crutches 🤔,"I agree, this is a nice place. Very Japanese serenity. There are a lot of very beautiful trees; however I was a bit disappointed to see that nearly all pine trees needed support not to fall over.

I came on a day trip in winter and in late spring overnight a couple years later. I can say that this is a fabulous place to visit any time of the year even if you don’t have a lot of time as long as it isn’t raining. Might as well go over to the tea district and do some shopping after your visit.",
Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Beautiful gardens that live up to the reputation,"These gardens come with the reputation of being among the best three in Japan. You see why as soon as you enter.
Attention to detail is abundant, although moments of tranquility are hard to come by when busy. It is a truly special place and good value when bought with a combo ticket for the adjacent castle, although the gardens there are free to enter and arguably a little more enjoyable than the castle itself, which is a recreation of the original and bereft of artefacts beyond info about how they rebuilt the castle","Written July 17, 2019"

Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Worth the trip,"This was one of the main reasons we stopped in Kanazawa, and so I was a bit nervous that it wouldn't live up to the hype. We visited in May, after the blossoms, before many flowers were out, except for the irises. It was lovely, nonetheless, and well worth the visit. I hate to think how busy it gets in blossom season, or in autumn or high season. In mid-May it was quite busy, but very manageable and pleasant.","Written July 6, 2019"

Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Awe-inspiring,"If you only do one thing in Kanazawa, visit Kenrokuen Garden. I got up early & got a taxi to be at the garden when it opens at 7am (tourist loop bus doesn't run that early). Going at opening time was completely worth the effort! That first half hour when the garden is almost empty is magical, absolutely awe-inspiring. I visited from 7am-10am on a cold, grey day and found that the garden was busy and noisy, including large tour groups, from 9am onwards. I stayed for three hours but you certainly don't need that long - I'd say one hour minimum.

I'd come back to Kanawaza just to go to Kenrokuen again.","Written July 3, 2019"
Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,This was the number one reason we came to Kanazawa,"I read this garden was rated the third most beautiful gardens in Japan. That is really saying something since there are so many gorgeous gardens at temples. This is right across the street from the castle. It was absolutely gorgeous, so much bigger than I imagined. So much to see. Because of the surroundings we saw a wedding photographer taking pictures of a couple in many locations around the garden. There are waterfalls, Wysteria trees, many varieties of plum trees and every turn is a feast for your eyes. I took many pictures. There is a shrine that is the origin of the name Kanazawa for the gold. If you see it, look up there is a great painting on the ceiling. I would highly recommend that when in Kanazawa, you must delight your senses at Kenroukuen Garden.","Written July 2, 2019"
Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Stunning Garden Park,"I spent a wonderful couple of hours just wabderingvthis spellbinding garden in Kanazawa. I knew it was considered to be world class and I expected to be impressed, but it still blew me away.
It's not just that its stunning, its theatmosohere of peace abdcserenity it has. It's big enough that everyone is not on top of each other but small enough and intimate enough to enable most visitors to walk pretty much every path.
The Kasumagike Pond, the highest in the park, is a gem with its famous pine at one end tmand turtle- shell shaped island in the middle. The rainbow bridge affords a great view.
The smaller Hisagoike Pond is beautiful too, much more shaded and hidden.
Another spot I i really loved was the Meijikinen Monument.
The real joy is to just wander, relax, take it all in contemplate.",

The design of the garden on undulating land provides popular fine views and parts which are quieter and more peaceful, with shaded avenues and mossy banks. Many manicured trees and shrubs creating a classic experience. Naturally enough, the plum grove in bloom was a hot spot for visitors in late March. Kanazawa was colder than Tokyo or Kyoto, with a light snowfall overnight, so we caught plum or peach blossom we missed elsewhere, but most cherry was yet to come out.",

It is a large but manageable size to walk around and you really do want to walk around the whole thing. The attention to detail is stunning and its beauty is evident without being showy. There are relatively few flowers except for beautiful rows of irises along a stream and a few other flowers but the beauty arises from the combination of trees, sculpted bushes, lovely miss covered areas, rocks, and bridges across several streams. Go early in the morning well before the groups arrive with their shrieking tour leaders desperately trying to herd their group.",
Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Truly beautiful,"Kenrokuen garden is one of the 3 best gardens in Japan. It is my favorite place in Kanazawa. The garden is quite big and relatively dense. It doesn't have huge wide-open spaces which make the character of Okayama's Korakuen. Instead it is packed with variety of very interesting trees, meandering brooks, little pavilions. It also has the oldest fountain in Japan. The garden is popular with visitors, but it doesn't feel overcrowded since you can usually find some less-used path to enjoy a bit of solitude.

In the far end of the garden you will find the Seisonkaku Villa and The Prefectural Museum for Traditional Products and Crafts. Neither of them is a must-see, and they require a separate entry fee, but since you are already here - come in. The villa has several rooms on two levels, nightingale floorboards and a little garden at the back, which you can only admire from the porch. The crafts museum has some beautiful products for sale, so it might be of particular interest if you want to bring home a little piece of Japan. Some items are quite expensive, but there are plenty of little things which are very affordable.

Don't forget to leave some time to wander through the nearby castle grounds and to see the Ishikawa Gate.

If you need to eat - there is a little cafe / coffee shop outside of the garden, very close to the northernmost point / entry gate (near the Ishikawa Gate). It is in the street forming the north-eastern edge of the garden, maybe 60-70 meters from the gate. They have very decent food, nice deserts, friendly service and reasonable prices. I think the sign is just 'COFFEE'.","Written May 21, 2019"

Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Beautiful,"Kenrokuen is recognized as one of the three great gardens of the style known as Kaiyushiki (a circuit stroll style garden that features a path around a pond) in Japan. Other two are Korakuen in Okayama city and Kairakuen in Mito city in Ibaragi. Kenrokuen is known for its cherry blossoms, plum trees and autumn foliage. And not to be missed is the beautiful peaceful snowy day panorama of the garden. It was a free admission day when we were there. Strolling the huge garden, you can appreciate how meticulously plants are cared for. The garden is not flat. It has high points and low points. Although there were many visitors, our experience was surprisingly quiet and calming. A Japanese beauty not to be missed.","Written May 17, 2019"
Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Very Crowded - Side paths are better,"I took the bus to Kenrokuen Garden and got turned around off the bus - walked around for 15 minutes before I crossed the street, walked up the steep to one of the entrances. Given all the tourists in town today, I wasn’t surprised that there were no English-speaking guides available at the information center but it was a shame. The map provided at admission is very useful. There were many tour groups so I veered off to the side paths because they were less crowded; turns out this was the right thing to do – I guess tour groups stick to the wider, well-trodden route! This garden is famous because it contains the six different sublime qualities to which a garden can aspire: spaciousness & seclusion; artifice & antiquity; watercourses & panoramas. I had printed some info about these qualities and how they’re put into practice at Kenrouken which helped me understand the objectives and accomplishments. And to realize that not everything in these gardens has to hit you in the face or be super huge or showy. While there were people all around, there were plenty of meandering paths so I could have a path to myself for a minute or two. The Sei son Kaku villa inside the park was very interesting - possibly the highlight of my visit to the park. Walking along the less travelled paths of the garden, I was interested to see how the branches of the large, older trees are propped up with very thick, strong & official looking wooden posts. I got to a point where there was an exit and I was ready to leave.","Written May 17, 2019"
Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,A beautiful garden of the highest quality.,"We were in Kanazawa for 3 days and visited Kenrokuen twice, for the different light. It is a stunningly beautiful garden, sculptured and planned to the highest details. Every few steps there are beautiful photo opportunities. We were here in mid-May when the Azaleas, magnolia and Wisteria are in full bloom. Cherry blossom season must be spectacular but so must the crowds! We found the quietest time was lunch time, too early or late and you will get the large tour groups. Go when people are elsewhere eating!

Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Different and interesting ...,"Not sure how or why, but we gained free entry: it may have been because it was a Sunday, or maybe because it was blossom season, but the gardens were packed with locals, which was nice to see, but maybe detracted somewhat from the peace and serenity ...

Given we were here for blossom season (early April), most of the trees, plants and flowers were devoid of greenery and bloom. As such, the gardens weren’t in their prime, but nonetheless we enjoyed traipsing through the different areas, which are beautifully and fastidiously maintained.

There’s a bit of uphill gradient in certain areas, and some bridges to cross, but neither are essential to appreciate part, if not all, of the gardens.

Worth a visit, especially given it’s adjacent to Kanazawa Castle and it’s lovely park.",
Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Morning,Spectacular expansive traditional Japanese garden in Kanazawa. Created in the Edo Period by a local Samurai leader.,
Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Is this the garden of six attributes or more five already?,"Kenroku-en means in Japanese ""Garden of six attributes of a perfect landscape"" . These attributes were listed in the Li Gefei`s book ""The Chronicles of the famous Luoyang gardens"". The Chinese poet listed them: spaciousness, seclusion, artifice, antiquity, waterways, and panoramas. Rare Park has three-four, Kenrokuen has all six. Or rather, had. Problem with seclusion. The Park was opened to the public in 1874 and attendance is only increasing. A place where you find yourself in solitude is hard to find. So there are only five attributes for us tourists. Maybe only workers of garden can have 6th attribute after the closure of the garden for the night. It is pointless to describe the beauty of the Park. Everything we see in Kenrokuen is created by human hands, even if it seems to us that it is a creation of nature. This ""natural"" beauty was created more than two centuries with a break for the fire, after which everything had to start anew. Kenroku-en was developed from the 1620s to the 1840s by the Maeda clan. To look at everything that was done for two centuries it takes 2 hours and 310 yen. For children only 100.",

A few cherry blossoms were left, although they were definitely past their peak. Despite all the people, the garden projects a tranquil atmosphere.

Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Beautiful Japanese Garden,"Kenrokuen literally means ""Garden of Six Sublimities"" - spaciousness, seclusion, artificiality, antiquity, abundant water and broad views. These special attributes made the Garden a perfect one. There are two main ponds in the garden. Cherry blossoms are must see here in spring time. The iconic pine tree protections will however be erected only in winter seasons. I missed it as it's the wrong timing. There are many walking trails and the pedestrian walkway just outside the Katsurazaka Gate was already very eye catching and picturesque.",
Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Lovely but crowded,"The gardens were lovely, but very crowded. The gravel paths, which made walking a bit tricky at times, were winding with inclines, constantly giving different views. What spoilt the experience for us was a local guide bellowing into a microphone as she conducted her group around. There was a restaurant inside, doing a roaring trade in ice-creams and several restaurants and shops just outside the gardens. Across the road, over a bridge, was the castle where we strolled around the grounds.",

Take care to admire the very old, beautiful trees that often have poles/twine/wires to support their sprawling branches. We went around 9:30am and it was already quite busy. This garden is more about the form of the landscape and it how it interacts with streams, ponds, water features, mossy areas, flowering trees and shrubs.

Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Beauiful garden,"Well deserving of it's top 3 ranking, this is a really lovely garden. Our second time to Kanazawa and this garden is something that I could never tire of, and one of the reasons to visit again. Not too large, it is easy to walk around in an hour, but deserves more time so you can take in the beautiful elements that are everywhere. On a clear day the reflections in the water are fantastic and the different sections of the garden each have their own beauty. We were there a little before peak cherry blossom season as some of the trees were just coming into flower so missed the mass effect, but even without flowers the garden is amazing. We did watch some of the gardeners taking down the winter supports from the pines which was fascinating in itself, and makes you realise just how much work goes into keeping the place looking good.","Written April 19, 2019"

Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Large garden with lots to see - but also large crowds,"The problem with the more famous Japanese gardens is that they were probably not designed to handle the huge crowds that descended on them particularly during cherry blossom season, and Kenrokuen is no exception even with its large size. I was fortunate to be visiting right after a heavy icy shower and it was also lunch time, so except for a couple of large and noisy tourist groups I had a pretty nice time enjoying the various sights before the large tour groups arrive in the afternoon. Do study the map to ensure you do not miss out on some of the more easily overlooked sights such as the Gankobashi (Flying Wild Geese) Bridge and the many beautiful pine trees.",

Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Exquisite and essential Japan,"The Kenroku-en garden of Kanazawa is a National Treasure for very good reason. It combines history, artistry and botanical beauty in a very accessible experience. This historic garden contains all the elements of a perfect Japanese garden. Ancient, well-tended trees and landscapes of both open and secluded views, water in ponds and bubbling streams, and long views all provide perfect structure and “bones” for this garden in any season. This strong structure is then accented by seasonal highlights-cherry and plum blossom, magnolia, azalea, water iris, then the depth of greens in summer and the riot of autumn colours.
This is also a people-0watching place-tourists, locals, young couples in traditional dress, having their photos taken to mark their relationship or engagement, schoolgirls or sisters, gracing delicately patterned kimonos, posing under overhanging cherry blossom boughs, elderly locals on their daily walk, cheeky, racing children, and the incredibly skilled gardeners perched on ladders to prune the ancient black pines into the shapes of gods and dancers. There are also some significant buildings, don’t miss the Seisonkaku villa, built by a warlord for his mother, a moving tribute to family love and care, and a fascinating example of traditional architecture. It also houses a fascinating collection of miniatures of extraordinary artistry.","Written April 5, 2019"
Japan,Kenrokuen Garden,Plum blossom season,"We went to Kanazawa specifically to see this garden. It’s not surprising that this garden is considered one of the best in Japan. It has great views all over, various walks around. The Plum Grove was in blossom and beautiful.
The garden has several places where you can get a light meal, drink or light lunch. We got a good vegan soup and snack in a tatami room overlooking the lake. Our fellow diners were two young women in lovely kimonos, which are worn by quite a few in Kanazawa it seemed.","Written April 4, 2019"

Japan,Nasu Animal Kingdom,Close proximity to animals and fun,"Then we drove to the second stop of the day: Nasu Animal Kingdom 那須動物王國. It is famous for having many animal shows, including Bird Performance Show, Cat Show, New Zealand Farm Show, and Aqua Friends.

There are also areas where visitors can interact with animals closely, such as Capybara Forest, Alpaca Hill, Tropical Rainforest. We had a good time in the park, with the opportunity to interact with the animals, many we had not seen before let alone be in such close proximity.

During the visit, one can also experience the nice ambiance of the Nasu Highland. Approaching noon we decided to have lunch at the Yamaneko Terrace, going for a soy sauce ramen while enjoying the gorgeous view in the backdrop.",
Japan,Nasu Animal Kingdom,Unique Experience in the Capybara Hot Spring Bath,"My wife and I bought very reasonably priced tickets for this place through a Tokyo deal book, and our tickets included a meal at the barbeque all-you-can-eat restaurant, a trip to the capybara hot springs, and regular admission.

In terms of pricing, we got a good deal - but, I think the all-you-can-eat barbeque restaurant prices (around 2500 yen [22 USD] per person as of October 2018), along with the capybara hot spring bath, which costs a little bit extra (around 250 yen [1.75 USD] per person) are pretty good bargains on their own, without a package deal.

The capybara hot spring bath is a unique experience, and there is a little pavilion outside of the hot spring where you can walk around in the buff and admire the mountainous landscape around the Tochigi plateau, as well as the capybaras, who are also relaxing in the buff. There were very few people using the hot spring when we went, so it felt quite private.

The barbeque restaurant is lovely. The selections for all you can eat a bit spartan by Japanese standards (vegetables; noodles for frying; beef, pork or lamb slices; yogurt with granola; a drink bar with a range of sodas and a cappuccino/coffee machine; and rice). The best part is really the view on the pavilion seating outside. There, you can enjoy the view of the mountains as you cook your own food at the table. It's very charming, but I'm not sure I'd recommend the restaurant on rainy or foggy days where the view is obstructed.

In regards to the animal treatment, I have to agree with many people who have gripes about the birds being in cages. It is pretty disheartening to see them unable to fly and with little space, so that's why I took away a star from this review. Some of the other animal cages were cramped as well and littered with feces, but I'm going to play devil's advocate and say that there are indeed other places, in Japan alone, that are much worse for animal treatment conditions.

You can pet many of the animals, including capybaras (which is another on the list of reasons to go to Nasu Animal Kingdom). The guests were all very respectful of the animals' space and the capybaras make squeaking noises similar to guinea pigs when you rub their bristly fur.

Overall, a great experience due to the mountainous background view and staff. The bird show and various animal feedings were a lot of fun, as well as the New Zealand sheep dog experience (the kiwi guy in charge of it was hilarious).

Good food, a fun trip, beautiful landscape. A few cramped cages, but overall, the animals really seem loved.

Tip: Don't forget that you need to book the pick-up and drop-off bus a day or two before you go.",
Japan,Nasu Animal Kingdom,Nice animal friendly zoo,"You cannot see wild animal but lots of farm animal and friendly animals. People can choose to feed rabbit, sheep or alpacas. Ride a camel or horse. Besides, there are animal show involving dogs and cats and other animal as well as eagles. You can see forest animal and penguin as well. Lovely place to visit.","Written July 1, 2017"

Suggest you buy ticket together w barbecue buffet . Restaurant food very small portion and expensive. Barbecue buffet is more worth . It's located in mountain . Very nice autumn leave view in early of November .",
Japan,Nasu Animal Kingdom,Animal lovers rejoice!,"While I dont disagree with the treatment of certain animals within the kingdom, this is comparatively better than similar places elsewhere in the world. More importantly, one could treat this as a way to introduce small kids to animals, would say this is still better than a zoo because of the interactive experience! You could take a bus ride from Nasushiobara station or a private car/taxi to get here, its a long way off. Dont forget to carry your camera to capture some moments, and please be kind to all the animals. Some animals are a bit inactive, but that could also be due to the season or timing of the visit or the very nature of the animals. No animals should be kept within a constrained environment, but for those that are, lets give them the love they deserve, this is one such place.","Written December 31, 2015"
Japan,Nasu Animal Kingdom,Good Zoo for your Children !,Nasu Animal Kingdom has a huge area for both indoor and outdoor animals . I love the shows so much .,
Japan,Nasu Animal Kingdom,A big let down. Cruel treatment to birds.,"We ( my wife, my 12 year old daughter and I ) are all animal lovers and we went to Nasu Animal Kingdom with a lot of expectations. As we first entered the park we were devastated to see a white cockatoo sitting alone chained to a small post. It was all alone in the room with visitors free to touch / pet the bird. It looked very sad and struggled to move as the chain was cruelly short.
Few other animals were also alone in their small / bare cages.
One unique aspect of this farm was that you could touch , pet and interact with the animals such as penguins, alpacas , reindeers ( that looked pathetic ) apart from cats and dogs. You are also encouraged to buy the animal feed kept near the enclosures and feed them.
We still cannot digest the cruel treatment meted out to the large birds of prey - they are chained to a small wooden pole alone in their enclosure unable to fly all day long. They are taken out by the trainers and allowed free flight for a few minutes as a part of the show few times a day. It was such a heart rending sight to see the big majestic birds ( American Bald Eagle etc) flutter and try to fly but cannot..
Interacting with the dogs and penguins was fun though. The bigger dogs did look active and energetic.

You have chances to pet lots of animals, and even hold a lion cub! I also got to see a baby wallaby which has appeared in television several times.
Other than that, I felt sorry for the dogs that you get to pet. They all look so tired, and bored. You have a chance to walk them, for a price, around the whole park. Adorable, but their furs were greasy and dirty, I felt terribly sad for them... It's very loud around there and the dogs hardly get any peace and quiet.
If you're lucky, you'll get to see staff walking an alpaca and get a change to pet it!
There's also a 'cat house' thing with lots of cats. of course, inside a spacious building. Lots of equipment and apparatus for the cats and lots of space for them to roam in. Many of them, however wanted space away from people.
The cable car which leads you down to the other half of the park, where you will see more farm/desert mammals, like horses, camels, kangaroos, sheep...etc. was a nice trip. Nice views as you go down with the cable car, however, it's quite dangerous, as there's no belts and it's quite steep.
I took several pictures of the animals and they're very inactive, and quite sad looking.",
Japan,Nasu Animal Kingdom,Many animals in huge area,"Unlike a zoo, Animal Kingdom is located on top of mountain and the area is huge. From the entrance there is a cat petting house and dog petting area so if you like animals you are free to enjoy being with dogs and cats. Many shows are also seen in sequence so you don't have to worry about missing one for because of another show.

From top area you will either need to walk a long way or to take a bus to another (huge) zone. There you will see raptor show, sheep show, alpacas, ducks, etc.

You may either take bus back or take ski lift (costs extra).","Written July 11, 2012"

Long, long escalators take you through to the upper level from where your adventure starts. The restaurant provided the best food we had during our stay in Atami and was well worth the 30 minute wait.

Due to the religious affiliation, I was initially reluctant to attend. But my wife was in Tokyo for a Japanese ikebana conference, and their rimpa style arrangements are originally based on the Korin artwork on display here, so she had to attend, which meant I had to attend.

Despite my reluctance, I'm very glad I came. The Korin exhibit was incredibly beautiful and the setting of museum in the hills over Atami is magnificent.

The entrance has long escalators which take one into the depths of the museum. Much of the artwork on display concentrates on Japanese and some Chinese, including exquisite pottery and beautiful objet's d'art.

Pity that the enthusiastic lady guide cold only explain the details in japanese which leaves the foreign visitor at a loss as there were no pamplets in english. they did provide a detailed English translation for the illustrated legend in ten chapters, or was it nine? Like the Golden Tea Room too, the sumptuousness capturing the importance of the emperor and lords who served him. Nice mix of European art, too, as Rembrandt's self-portrait in his youth was displayed along with Monet and other French artists. The Chinese pottery, mainly from the Ming and Song dynasties also made absorbing viewing.

Japan,Kunozan Toshogu Shrine,NOT an Easy Climb.,"I disagree, the climb is NOT an easy one. The stone steps are uneven, steep and can be as high as 10 inches in certain sections. The area was wet due to overnight rain. We noticed many people who simply stopped after the first series because it was quite strenuous for someone who is not in top physical condition or may have some mobility limitations. The wood and bamboo walking sticks are situated near the ticket booth but are reserved for the elderly or those with trouble walking.

We took a taxi to the ropeway and arrived shortly before the cruise ship buses.

This shrine was one of the prettiest and colorful that we have seen in Japan. There are a few structures in the small complex - none of which are open to visitors. You simply look inside. We reached the top of the hill. Entrance fee is only 500 yen.",

The sticks made a big difference as we climbed higher and higher to the top. The views from the top to the bay would be spectacular on a clear day, but we arrived in the middle of a rain storm.

The place itself is a jewel. Ieyasu’s grandchild considered this place to small and constructed Nikko, now overrun by tourist. Nikko is an inflated Kunozan without the atmosphere you can find here. Climbing the walkways inside the shrine complex one feels that this was the place were a big ruler got his peace to think over his realm.

Japan,Kunozan Toshogu Shrine,An exciting day trip from Nagoya or Tokyo,"Shizuoka Station is about an hour from Tokyo and 68 minutes from Nagoya by Shinkansen. I met a Japanese Facebook friend who lives in Florence, Italy for the first time there, and the tourist information center recommended us to go to Kunozan Toshogu. Both of us have been to the Toshogu Shrine in Nikko, and we were curious what this Toshogu Shrine looks like at Kunozan. We obtained coupons at the information center, which helped us save a few dollars. We took a 10:30 bus from Gate No.11 at the North Exit of the station to get to Nihondaira (580 yen/40 minutes).
There are several buses running throughout the day. From Nihondaira, which is one of Japan's 100 most scenic spots where you can see Mt.Fuji, we took a cable car. The round trip costs 1,100 yen and with a coupon it is 990 yen. The ride is rather short (5 minutes) and expensive, but the beautiful scenery is worth it. (How many times can you experience this in your life time?) The other option was walking, and we did not want to do it on a hot summer day. The Shrine is located on top of Kunozan (270m) and it was constructed 19 years earlier than the one in Nikko. The scale, being on the mountain top, is not as big as the one in Nikko, but the architectures are beautiful. The main hall is a national treasure - is unique style, bright colors, and construction materials are gorgeous. There was a small exhibition box with Ieyasu's Gundam plastic model, too!! Regular admission to the shrine is 500 yen but with a coupon it is 400 yen for adults. If you combine the Shrine and the museum, it is 800 yen (with coupon 700 yen).You can use the coupon for up to 5 people.The museum houses many items which the Tokugawa Shoguns owned. I especially liked Ieyasu's clock from Spain. There is a small shop-cafe near the museum, and my friend and i had matcha soft ice cream with Abakawa mochi (local sweets), sweet red beans, and corn flakes (400 yen) and ate the delicious dessert looking at the sky and the ocean from there.

I booked a bus so I wouldn't have to navigate the Japanese train system even though I've heard that isn't actually very difficult to do, and I had a fantastic day. In many ways the shrine itself feels quite different from some of the others I've visited so that was neat and the lake up in the mountains that we also stopped at was one of the most beautiful places I've ever been with a remarkably calming vibe.

Japan,Kunozan Toshogu Shrine,Ieyasu was a little man.... so is this shrine,"I'm a history buff of the Sengoku period and so naturally I was excited to visit Ieyasu's shrine, but I definitely had grander expectations. The shrine itself is lovely and you can enjoy the architecture of the walls and buildings - though it should be stressed you're barred from entering any of them within the actual compound. Quickly you realize this trip is more a 30 minute detour that doesn't justify a trip in of itself, yet can adequately complement a larger more expansive trip.

Some advice to travelers: you may also have checked and read about the nihondaira rope way and may plan to drop that into you trip to this shrine. Don't waste the money. The ropeway is a 5 minute descent to the shrine over a view of nothing but trees. It's like getting a closeup of broccoli. Also, suggest skipping the Tokugawa museum there - unless you're really keen to see Ieyasu's scissors and his bookshelf.",

Japan,Kunozan Toshogu Shrine,Do you know IEYASU TOKUGAWA? It's possible to see a shrine of his grave and national treasure.,"Tokugawa Ieyasu is deified in Tosho-gu, it's a shrine. When he died in 1616, Tokugawa Ieyasu was reburied in Kunouzan Toshogu immediately. It's deified in Nikko Tosho-gu after that, but it's this place that there is a grave of Ieyasu. There isn't history museum in Shizuoka-shi, so to know Ieyasu deeply, I come to this place, and a museum, a grave and a shrine should be seen, and it's understood. Ieyasu wasn't 75 years old any more, but government by the shogunate beat Toyotomi Hideyoshi's child and Hideyori who spend 15 years from 60 years old by Shizuoka-shi and have in Osaka-jo, and fought and won to become in peace. After that I crossed to rule by the law made personally in 15 generations and about 260 years as a will, and peaceful government was brought to Japan. This time isn't called Tokugawa Period because there was Shogunate in Edo, and says the Edo Period. It's possible to see grand Mt. Fuji from Nihondaira on the day which cleared up. It's said that Japanese best is beautiful, so please come by all means.","Written October 26, 2015"

Japan,Kunozan Toshogu Shrine,good half-day excursion,"Take a bus bound for 'Nihondaira' mountain; from the top of the mountain take a cable car across to Kunozan Toshogu Shrine. This is the original shrine built to enshrine 'Ieasu Tokugawa', before his remains were moved to their current place in 'NIKKO' which is a super-sized copy of the original Kunozan Shrine. Go on Saturdays and Sundays spring and fall and it's almost guaranteed you'll be able to wittness a Japanese wedding procession taking place there.
If you want to climb the mountain instead of taking the bus and cable car, you can take the stairs to reach the top - in that case you need to take a bus along 'Strawberry road' to the south-side of nihondaira mountain along the ocean, and take the ancient stairs to the top. A reasonably fit person can master these stairs in about 20-30 minutes; the view of the ocean along the way is spectacular, too.

Japan,Kunozan Toshogu Shrine,"Walked 1,200 steps up the stone stairs","Kunozan Toshogu Shrine is located at the top of Kunozan, a small mountain where you will need to climb 1,200 steps up the stone stairs. Please wear comfy footwear as the steps are rocky and uneven. I was surprised that it was not as tiring as I thought to climb the thousand over stairs. If you really cannot climb stairs, you can also take the ropeway from Nihondaira and walk down the stairs after that. I highly recommend taking the stairs up though.

To get to the foot of Kunozan, we took a bus from JR Shizuoka station and walked to the foot of the mountain in about 3 minutes. This shrine is dedicated to one of Japan's most famous leader, Tokugawa Ieyasu. From the shrine, you can take the ropeway to Nihondaira where you can see Mount Fuji on a clear day, Unfortunately, I could not see Mount Fuji on that day as it was cloudy.

Not just in Toshogu Shrine but the area surrounding the hill the shrine sat on. As s student studying Japanese in the US at the time it was the first place I really got to connect with the materials I was learning.

I wanted to come back and enjoy another trip to Nikko and came with some friends it was easy to do since I was living in Tochigi at the time. We had an amazing time just relaxing in the hot springs in the area and chilling in the area near our hotel which was also near Toshogu Shrine.

Early November is a good time to visit.
There are 3 sections of the Park that you can choose to visit. And you must take a Tobu Bus to go to those places.

Section 1 is from Nikko station to Bus stop #26.
Section 2 is from Bus stop #26 to 35
Section 3 is from Bus stop 35 to beyond

Most people go to section 1 with lots of sightseeing like shrines, temples and a big lake (where you can board a boat cruise)

Section 2 and 3 are less people but more romantic if you two couple want more bit romantic time together.

Make sure you know the Bus schedule for going back to Nikko station because it gets dark quickly after 5pm. There’s a limited schedule for both Bus and train at Nikko National Park. Please ask the tourist information people for details.",

We traveled in a group of 14, and came to Japan one day before our guided tour of Japan were to start. We decided to visit Nikko and needed a bus which would pick us up with all our suitcases at the airport and by the end of the day bring us to our Tokyo hotel. I stumbled upon an excellent company Bus Hire. The lady I communicated with, Natsumi, was extremely cordial, attentive to all our needs, and proactive. She not only arranged a bus suitable for our needs, but provided a tour guide, and even suggested what we should eat and where to avoid the crowds. She inquired if we had any food requirements and suggested what we should see at Nikko in the limited time we had (and this is a bus rental office!). After our trip, which went without a glitch, and on-time, she inquired whether everything was to our liking. We are very pleased with the services of this company. And her English was perfect (which is a rarity in Japan, even at large hotels). So, come to Japan and hire a bus to see places of your choosing. It is easy and not much more expensive than going places using public transportation.","Written April 13, 2019"

UNESCO awarded the National Park of Nico the title of World Heritage Site in 1999, thanks to the city's temples. The Nikko city boasts beautiful mountains, among them the most beautiful waterfalls and waterfalls in Japan, which are packed with monkeys, so it is recommended to keep all your valuables in your bags so that the monkeys will not steal them. , Because they tend to snatch such things from people 's hands The Nikko National Park is about 125 kilometers north of Tokyo, and you can get to Niko by Tobu or Japan Railways, and if you purchased the JR Pass, It is more worthwhile to take the Japan Railways train, although it requires a train exchange at Utsunomiya Station, which takes about 1 hour and 40 minutes to Japan Railways, and Nikko's famous temples are about 2 km from Nikko train stations. If the weather is pleasant and you have power, you can reach the temples on foot by walking 30-40 minutes along Nico's main street. Alternatively, you can use the bus, which departs from the train station to the temples. The bus ride is about 10 minutes long and it is more worthwhile to purchase a round trip ticket if you intend to return by bus on the same day.","Written November 5, 2018"

One could spend a few hours or days here. There are many trails. We took DexterD2013’s suggestion to take the bus up and walked our way down. We didn’t go all the way up to Yumoto Onsen but worked our way down from just above the Senjogahara Moor, past Ryukyu Falls and hopped back on the bus at Stop 34 to Kegon Falls. The attractions were busy as tourists mainly get bused from one attraction to the next but the trail was quiet.
The trails were well marked and easy to walk. Comfortable walking shoes are a must but doesn’t need hiking boots. Outerwear that keeps moisture out would be handy as the weather up there is hard to predict. Markedly cooler than Nikko. Most of the walk was under cover so sun protection is less critical.",

Japan,Nikko National Park,Great Walk with Beautiful Scenery,"If you are looking to get out of town, the walk around the lakes / river is excellent. We got one of the 'free' bus passes for 2 days. If you catch it to stop 45 or 46 (the end of the ride), you can then walk gradually downhill around the lakes, with a couple of waterfalls along the way. We caught the bus from stop 34 on the way down as the walkway from there down is largely beside the road and not as scenic. Get off and on at stop 26 if you want to see Kegon Falls (much more touristy). You can do as much walking as you want to. We ended up doing 28,000 steps.

Positives
- Well maintained walkway - a lot of it on built up wooden walkways
- Mostly downhill
- Beautiful scenery and very nice walking down next to the river
- Very friendly fellow walkers! Many with little bells to keep the bears away!!
- Option to get off / on the bus at key points
- The switch-back road on the bus ride back down is amazing!

Not so great
- once you get to stop 34 it isn't as scenic around the shores of Lake Chuzenji
- Kegon Falls (stop 26) are right in a small village and far more touristy, with people just driving to have a look at them","Written September 22, 2018"

Japan,Nikko National Park,NOT tourist friendly at all,"Nikko is heavily marketed as a tourist destination, but I am disappointed to report that it was barely tourist friendly. There are no elevators available at JR Nikko Station, so travelers have carry their luggage up and down the stairs. This is a little troublesome. I know some smaller Japanese train stations do not have elevators, but I am baffled as to why this tourist destination does not have this modern convenience for all the tourists they entice to come and visit.

Secondly, the staff I encountered at the JR Nikko Tourist Info Centre was incredibly rude (by Japanese standards). Her name was Ayuha Suzuki. When I requested a map and public transport info, she just gestured to the map on the table, which was not very informative. She also did not have any printed schedules to give to me. It is strange there aren't any printed bus or train schedules at the Tourist Info Centre. I have been to numerous Tourist Info Centres across Japan, and they all have printed public transport information on hand to give out to travelers. I believe that is why they are called Tourist - Information - Centres.

I asked if she had more info in English, as I would be going around different parts of Nikko. She proceeded to huffily walk out from the counter, stormed off to the other side of the room, and pointed roughly to the brochures. ""THERE. ENGLISH.""

This is not the Japanese hospitality I have grown accustomed to while traveling in Japan. I am very taken aback to be treated so rudely by staff that are meant to be friendly and helpful. Less well known places, like Lake Tazawa and Naruko Onsen, had infinitely more cheery and helpful staff.

In any case, Nikko is most definitely not a tourist friendly destination, and should not be marketed as such. If you do visit, make sure you do all your research beforehand as the staff are unlikely to be of any help.","Written October 30, 2017"

Walks are to taxing...unless you want them to be. Lay in one of the Onsens and dream about being active if you have to!! Just get there...it is grand",
Japan,Nikko National Park,Stay away on weekend,"Too overcrowded and too many local Japanese day tourists. Bus connection does not help because of too many private cars. MUST avoid on weekends.

Was there during the first October 17' weekend. This is kind of the beginning of the autumn (leaf color change) here. This means that during any weekend it will be packed by local Japanese day tourists.

There is a bus going from the Nikko train stations up to the hiking area. You can buy the 'Nikko pass' for 3000¥ for two consecutive days or decide to take single rides on the bus for very expensive prices (one time up and one time down is 3200¥, so it makes sense).
On the weekend the roads are so packed with private cars that a 1:20 hour ride on a weekday took 3:30 hours on a Sunday. So try by any means to not spend a weekend here!
They ought to improve the bus connections on the weekends during the high season and let less private cars go up by charging more for the parking lots up there and less for the overpriced bus pass (3000¥!!!!). There were passengers who had to stand up the whole 3 hour bus ride up to the last stop (yomoto-onsen).

It's a pitty but this made Nikko a negative memory for me. Would not recommend it on a weekend.",

Japan,Nikko National Park,Very Different From Your Typical National Park!,"Nikkō National Park is a breathtaking park you do not want to miss. It's absolutely phenomenal and alive with rich culture and history. It's unlike any national park I have ever visited.

I'm from the states, so to me national parks literally mean parks full of nature. Maybe a canyon or a geyser here and there surrounded by trees. But in Japan, WOW! There's mountains and mountains of forestation and cedar trees as tall as buildings! And so many gorgeous temples and shrines to visit! I was taken away to how colorful and amazing each building and gate was. It's as if time has stopped and I stepped right into history. I had the most wondrous time.

Whether you're a history buff, book worm, city girl -- doesn't matter! This park is a must see site for all! And it's definitely a suitable tourist location for the young and old, family vacations and even with friends. Enjoy!",
Japan,Nikko National Park,This place must be one of top 5 to visit in Japan,I visit Japan every year for business but always take two days for pleasure. This place is really worth to spend two days minimum. Relatively short trip from Tokio by train. Buy a bus pass and book Japanese type of room in hotel to complete your fun package. If you are not very in Japanese history half day is enough to see main temples and shrines. But my advice to dedicate one day for the park itself ... take a bus to the very top last stop (Yuno Lake) so you can go by foot down to Kegon Falls and get on the bus to return to the town. It's long trip but worth every minutes.,"Written July 12, 2017"

I bet it is so beautiful in spring and fall! It was nice to get out of the big cities Japan is known for. So much scenery to take in. I got a 2 day pass from the Nikko train station to hope on and off a bus so that I could see as much as possible!!! I thin kit was 2000 yen and well worth it!

Japan,Nikko National Park,"Very good views, away from the city, historical sites","This is a very good place to visit outside of the city. It's has a good combination of nature and historical sites that you'll feel like you're in paradise. There are lots of shrines here. The main shrines can be accessed via the bus, but you can also take the historical walking tour following a simple map (and help of google maps) to visit all of the nearby shrines and attractions. If you have enough time, can you also do hiking tours, but it will require far more preparation and you'll be venturing into unpaved paths.","Written March 31, 2017"

Japan,Himeji Castle,An Incredible Castle,"If you have time to see one Castle while in Japan make sure it's Himeji Castle. I've seen many castles in Japan and Himeji has been the most impressive so far. The complex and castle itself is gigantic. At first when walking through the gate, you get a great view of the castle. There is an open field here, makes for great photos. I came here at 9am to tour the castle and highly recommend paying the entrance fee to visit. Visiting the main keep was amazing, the size of the castle was impressive and seeing the inside was very neat. Not a whole lot of decorations or anything, actually there is nothing inside the castle, but the wood work inside is nice. After viewing the main keep, head toward the long hall to see more of the castle and grounds. You can easily spend a few hours here. When getting your ticket you can do a combination ticket for the gardens next door, it's an extra 50 yen, so well worth seeing both the castle and the gardens.","Written October 26, 2020"

Japan,Himeji Castle,The most spectacular castle we got to witness!,"When talk is Japanese castles, Himeji is definitely part of that conversation and rightfully so. It is among the best preserved monuments and still a breathtaking sight from near or far. Don't expect to see fancy stuff inside, Japanese castles are not about that, but the eperience in total is very much worth the time spent here!",
Japan,Himeji Castle,The White Heron Castle - largely original and wholly impressive,"We visited Himeji (White Heron) Castle by train from Osaka, choosing to go from there on our trip to Japan purely because it was closer than Kyoto and we travelled independently instead of booking a tour because it was so easy using Japan’s excellent transport system and gave us the freedom to go early before the bulk of the castle’s daily visitors arrived, timing it so that we had about 20 minutes to wait unti, it opened. On arrival at JR Himeji station head straight out of the main entrance and take the good walk straight up Otemae Dori and as you get to the last stretch the Castle comes into clear view. Then when you reach the T junction at the top, cross over heading diagonally to your left to enter the park and ignoring the zoo on your right follow the curving road around to the left up to the castle entrance.
If you get there early to avoid the crowds I would suggest you forego a guide for the visit because that will leave you with growing numbers filling your photos. For the same reason it’s probably bette to do as we did and head straight to the top of the Dai-tenshu or main keep first, the route being pretty obvious once you are in and gradually following steps up and around to the right initially. The interiors is on 6 floors (a 7th is below ground and we didn’t see any access to it) and the route is via a series of steep wooden steps. There is little to see on each floor and the interiors is unfurnished and undecorated though there are occasional displays of roof tiles and text detailing the castle’s history. The weapon racks on the walls along the way also remind that this was a defensive structure and not merely for display, it was a military and political centre in it’s day. Take time too to enjoy the views outside as you ascend and to admire the structure itself as you get to stare out across 5e rooftops and over to the Nishi-no-Maru Bailey from where you will be able to look back and capture some photos of the keep hopefully with cherry blossom in shot. To admire the sheer bulk of the keep you can stand too directly below it in the large open space that is the Bizen-Maru bailey. The square San-goku-bori moat and outer buildings give plenty more to see on leaving the keep and once outside the castle heading back out to the road and turning right will bring you to Koko-en gardens which are well worth a visit and where you can enjoy a Japanese tea ceremony.
We enjoyed our visit and owing the castle is original and not wholly reconstructed as so many were following WWII or subsequent fires only added to the sense of history.
In summary then we found it really useful to visit independently by train instead of booking a tour, visited early to arrive shortly before the opening time. We also self guided and headed directly to the big point of the main keep, ahead of the growing number of visitors and avoiding queuing for the stairs while getting photos largely empty of other visitors. If you have any mobility problems though be aware that the stairs are steep and it’s a long way up to the top with the stairs narrowing as you go.
Hope you enjoy your visit as much as we enjoyed ours.","Written March 23, 2020"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Fantastic Architecture,"I came to Himeji Castle and I wasn't sure what to expect. I had seen many castles in Europe, but nothing like this. The unique designs and colors certainly rival Europe's finest palaces. There are also many gardens surrounding the castle along with a zoo and theme park, but I only went to the castle. The castle tour is fun. You walk at your own speed up many stairs. You have to take off shoes, however, to keep the castle tidy. The exterior is fantastic and a wonder to behold, but the interior does lack some of the flair of the outside. This contrast does keep the castle from earning five stars, but it's worth visiting if you're not too far.","Written March 12, 2020"

The castle itself is spectacularly situated on a hill, approached through extensive gardens, some 2 km from the mainline station, and features prominently on many promotional posters and advertising for Japanese tourism. Easy reach from Osaka, this is an absolute must-see venue for visitors to Western Honchu!","Written March 7, 2020"
Japan,Himeji Castle,A Must visit castle,"It was already awesome looking the time we came out of the station. The walk on the road to Himeji castle from the station was about 15 mins or 20 mins slow walk. Along the road you can find lots of yummy food like the udon, ramen, gyoza and shopping streets, so it’s never boring to walk. Posted on the food in a separate post.

In the himeji castle compound there was a small zoo which we didn’t go as that was not the highlight. Besides the castle, there are other structural compound at the site that u can visit first if the castle gets crowded.

The stairway within the castle and buildings are steep, so if you are bringing young kids or elderly, it may be a challenge if you decide to go all the way up to the top of the castle. See one of the photo. For tall folks, be aware of your head as the beam at the entrance/exit of the stairway may be too low for u.

Everyone will have to change to their slippers. They have it in big, medium and kids size. As I have slim feet, the slippers keeps falling off so for safety reasons, i walked bare footed while climbing up and down the stairs. I do see some kids having the slippers falling off too.

At the top of the castle , the windows are with bars so it was hard taking gd views at the top. Anyhow, if u hv experienced a castle in japan before, the interior is more or less the same I guess.

Another thing my sis noticed while going up and down the castle was that it was slighted slanted to one side which was true when we read one of the narratives. We went in winter and it was awesome already. Can’t imagine when it’s during cherry blossom. But still I prefer lesser crowd.",

The castle is extensive, and you really appreciate the workmanship and incredible defensive arrangements it has by visiting the main castle. Be warned there are lots of steps, and you need to take off your shoes and wear slippers, I found these difficult to climb steps in, so finished off taking them off, so wear a good pair of socks.

Japan,Himeji Castle,3 ways for a gaijin to apppreciate the castle,"First, one could venture in cluelessly up the ramp and stairs through the empty halls up to the top. Second, one could hire an expensive guide (rates I saw were ~$100 per tour). Third - which I highly recommend - is to accept the free tour offer from the ladies of the Historical Society, just behind the ticket counter. I was slightly skeptical at first but my guide, Ms. Nagata, turned out to be phenomenally knowledgeable. There are so many - infinite - interesting subtleties about the history, architecture, political-social-military behind the castle to be appreciated. I suspect that an enthusiast who lives in the area and grew up around the castle has so much more offer than a guide for hire. So, I recommend it.

The castle was built in 8 years but housed a succession of daimyos from the Tokugawa clan who used it to control the restive masses far down south from Edo. From the military perspective the attention to detail in the design is nothing if not brilliant. Worth a visit.",

Japan,Himeji Castle,We lost sense of time it was so awesome!,"Let me tell you...we went here thinking this would be a better option to the million or so tourist infested venues in Kyoto. We weren't wrong. At first I was put off by a review by someone going on about nothing being within the castle and just a lot of walking and climbing steep stairs while wearing ill-fitting slippers.

Let me tell you. We ventured forth thinking we didn't want to spend the money on the actual visit inside and I took a leap of faith knowing we probably won't be back in our lifetime. We were both glad we did. There is a wealth of information within the castle and most exhibits are in Japanese as well as English. In addition, they have kept the grounds and castle as historically correct as possible. So yes, there are a lot of steep stairs and long hallways of gorgeous wood. If you spend time here you will see the awesome workmanship and the continued restoration of this relic that has been around longer than many other countries have even been alive! This place is awesome. I wish I knew more about Japanese history to truly be enveloped by the stories, but unfortunately I know very little. Even so, you get the idea of what happened here and how it happened.

Mind you the museum at the end of the castle was closed and will be closed until April 2020 there was still a wealth of information. Docents are very knowledgeable and even in halting English one sought me out with my daughter to show us some little known facts about the construction of the main Keep. It was awesome and I wanted to go back and thank her again and again for such awesome knowledge sharing.

Japan,Himeji Castle,Family trip with a 7 month old baby,"We took the train from Osaka, which took us about 50 minutes. It might seem long, but it's actually just a few stops since the train skips local train stations. The train ride was lovely as it took the coastal route.

The castle is about max 10 minutes walking from the Himeji station. We actually thought we would have to hike a lot, but you literally just walk through the main street from the station to get there.
Upon entering the castle gates, there is a big courtyard with cherry blossom trees on the side. From here you get a good view of the castle already.

We had a baby stroller with us, which we were not allowed to take in the castle. We had to leave this behind the ticket office, where they have a designated are for strollers.
If you are travelling with a baby, I HIGHLY recommend you bringing a carrier.
We went to see the main keep, where we had to take our shoes off. We were handed slippers by the staff, however these were not really convenient to walk with on a properly waxed wooden floor and stairs. It got quite slippery, so at some point I took mine off.
The stairs are very steep and narrow. Walking up with a baby in the carrier was quite a challenge as it got steeper and more narrow the more you ascend.

Enjoy climbing steep staircases on dimly lit floors to admire the the holes in the walls for arrows and shotguns. The grounds themselves are also fun to wander around, so budget some time to really soak in the experience. You can also admire the castle for free from different angles and get some great photo shots. Try the bridge on the way to the entrance, the main grounds in front of the castle, and the Shiromidai Park just a short walk southeast of the castle on a street corner.

However, the walk around inside the castle is worth it to get a feel for what it was like in those years when the castle was used as a defense. Enjoy climbing steep staircases on dimly lit floors to admire the the holes in the walls for arrows and shotguns. The grounds themselves are also fun to wander around, so budget some time to really soak in the experience. You can also admire the castle for free from different angles and get some great photo shots. Try the bridge on the way to the entrance, the main grounds in front of the castle, and the Shiromidai Park just a short walk southeast of the castle on a street corner. Also, don't forget to explore the city a bit on your way to and from the castle from the station. There is a nice covered shopping street you can check for souvenirs and other goods on your way to the castle.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Perfect park for relaxing,"When we came to Himeji, on the road to the castle we found next to station big naturally looks restaurant with cascade levels for sitting. At the every level was tree, bourn. Few steps closer to castle we found Sega club, yes, its Japan´s game club, you can play just for 0,10Y, front of club they have many toys of Pokemons. When we came to castle, we saw many of Koi fishses in river under temple, walk through the park to castle was amazing, we didnt catch the time for visit it, we came little late for last visit, becouse we made stop in every corner, we only walk around, its really big area park, quietly and perfect for relax.

We went there on Sunday noon, and there were garage sale going on along part of the road.
And then need to pass the beautiful garden and or zoo.
Enter the castle, we needed to take off shoes and wearing the provided slippers. Prepare for the steep stairs. Many old people really made it to the top of the castle. View from the top was lovely.

Japan,Himeji Castle,Worth the visit,"The castle provides a window back in time and is a popular place to visit. Be prepared to climb pathways and reasonably steep stairs inside the castle (carrying your shoes - slippers are provided). Great views from the top and you get a good appreciation of the engineering/construction necessary to build it.
Buy the combination ticket for the gardens (300 mtrs away) as they are definitely also worth a visit with great examples of water features and detailed layout.

Japan,Himeji Castle,Stunningly Beautiful Castle,"We went to Himeji on a day trip from Kyoto via Shinkansen, and found it an incredibly worthwhile experience. The castle is stunning, sitting high on a hill at the end of a long boulevard, that leads from the train station. At the tail-end of the Japanese New Year's celebration, we were concerned about the crowds, but the hour, or so wait, as we wound up the narrow road to the castle, was itself enjoyable, and climbing through the castle itself a great lesson in history and craftmanship. It has been on my 40-year long Japan bucket list, and I was very happy I went..","Written January 9, 2020"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Interesting to see the difference between this and European fortifications,"I took about three hours visiting but could have spent more time here with better preparation, fatigue set in from the volume of information I was trying to cram in. A word of warning - much as I expect, and respect, the necessity to remove outdoor footwear and Don slippers I was not prepared for the difficulty of climbing narrow and steep stairways whilst not comfortably shod, if you have some of those socks with non-slip soles in you luggage this could be the place to wear them.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Amazing castle,"We walked all around it first, and got to see egrets? roosting in a big tree. A beautiful park behind it. We saw it in the daylight, going inside for the whole experience. It was a tad cold in there, in our stocking feet, but it was amazing to see the structure. We saw it at night, all lit up and just a gorgeous symbol for the city. The stone walls at the base, the smooth walls of the castle, so interesting to see. And so easy to get to from the train station. 15 minute walk up a broad boulevard with sculptures all the way. We missed the street festival by one day!!",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Impressive,"I visited here with a group of local friends. We arrived quite late with only an hour to look around, but it did the job.

From the outside it is indeed beautiful to look up at and also looking at the rest of it from inside also provided some more unusual angles. Climbing up was definitely a trek and as someone with arthritis in both knees it was not easy. I'm very glad I did it though as the views from the top close to sunset were gorgeous. Is it worth climbing up if your not interested in the views? Probably not as each floor was basically the same ...polished wood and steep steps.

I know Himeji is considered the best castle in all of Japan, but I think there are others that grab my attention more.

The castle is about 20 mins walk from JR Himeji. There are buses too.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,"Glorious outside, disappointing inside. Don't miss the adjacent Kokoen gardens.","Claimed to be the most beautiful castle in Japan, it really is stunningly beautiful on a sunny day with a blue sky background. The inside visit was disappointing: there are very little artefacts and furniture inside, and the inevitable crowds make it all rather fraught as you shuffle round, up steep and slippery wooden stairs into the narrowing floors as you go to the top, then back down again for relief from the confined and crowded spaces. Don't miss the adjacent Kokoen gardens, which are a blaze of colours in the autumn.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,"Outside impressive; inside, not so much","Himeji is definitely a great stop if you are traveling through on the Shinkansen from Hiroshima to Kyoto. The train station has lockers in which you can store your luggage and it's easy to walk around the city and up to the castle (or you can grab a cab). The castle is probably one of the more impressive pieces of architecture in Japan, although the tour inside is not so worth it. Seeing the outside and then taking in the neighboring garden would have been sufficient for us.","Written January 5, 2020"
Japan,Himeji Castle,"Outside looks beautiful, but don't waste your time and energy inside","Himeji Castle is of course one of the most iconic images from Japan, and I wanted to squeeze in Himeji somehow in my trip. I did so by squeezing it in my day-trip between Kyoto and Hiroshima. The castle is 20-minute walk from JR station, or 1 bus away with 2 stops. Once you start approaching the castle, you start getting the beautiful views of the castle. There are huge grounds outside the entrance which afford nice views, to click photos of yourself as well if you want. However despite all the hype, I'd strongly suggest to not waste your time, money and energy going in. There is absolutely nothing inside, it's barren walls amongst a lot of steep stairs to get to the top from where you can see some city views. At the end of descending, I entered museum which detailed about the Castle and how it survived the WW2 becoming an iconic part of Japanese identity. This museum was a better experience than rest of the climbing stairs inside. I'd go as far as to call the castle not unmissable, and if you can't squeeze it in your trip don't worry- Osaka Castle looks majestic too, and inside that castle there is actually something.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Himeji experience,"It was greatest privilege bestowed on me to be able to walk the floor where many great samurai warriors walked such as Hideyoshi and others

Entering the castle area is required to take off the footwear.The building inside the castle is dominated by old and big woods, both floors, stairs, pillars and gates. There are 6th floors in the castle and through a narrow staircase to each floor to the top. Be careful while climbing the stairs to the top.

Japan,Himeji Castle,Beautiful Castle,"We took a day trip from Osaka to visit the Himeji Castle. As soon as we stepped out of the train station, we enjoyed the openness and quietness of the city, a good break from the busy Osaka and Tokyo. The castle is within walking distance from the train station so we opted to walk. The castle looked so beautiful and stunning from the outside. There was a small admission fee to go inside. We went in November so it wasn’t super crowded and no lineup to get in. As some people has commented, the castle wasn’t “furnished“ but you go in to admire the architectural designs and the constructions . We took our time on each level and no one rushed us. There were some steep stairs to climb going up to some levels so may not be suitable for everyone. Once on the top level, the views were spectacular. We were lucky to visit on a clear day so we could see far. After exiting the castle, I think most people just left. We walked around a bit and found out you could actually walk inside the corridor surrounding the castle. That was very interesting too. Our admission also included the entry to the nearby garden “ Koko-en ”. Given that it was the fall, not many flowers could be seen. It was still nice to walk around and enjoyed the quietness. If you happen to be in Osaka or Kyoto, I highly recommend this place to visit. One last note, I didn’t know about the “Discover Himeji Castle with AR” until much later so I didn’t download the app. With the app and the QR codes at various spots, visitors could get more details about the castle.","Written November 21, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Interesting but not what I expected,"Maybe I am spoilt from the castles I have visited in Europe. The castles in Europe are furnished with household goods from that era. Japanese castles are basically bare timber floors and a lot of stairs to to top floor.

Easy walk from the train station and the town has a huge shopping arcade. From the railway station to the castle.

Japan,Himeji Castle,Most beautiful castle in Japan,"I've always wanted to Visit the White Heron Castle as the picture of this castle always adorned the calendars since I was young.

Finally my dream came true and it's still the most beautiful castle in Japan. Not that I've visited all, but been to quite a few and this is still the most outstanding one. So majestic! It's walkable from the Himeji JR Station. Around 20 minutes or so. Just straight down from the JR Station entrance. We took the bus, as we went to the ropeway first before returning to visit the White Heron. Climbed up to the tallest tower, although most of the artifacts are not there but can still admire the architecture and structure of the castle.

After visiting the castle, we took a leisurely walk back to our hotel next to the JR station and it was a wonderful walk in the evening. Stopping by at the little shops selling green tea ice-cream and green tea. As we made our way back to the hotel, we got our bearings of where the shopping and food streets are. Sadly I couldn't explore everything as we only had 1 night there.

Definitely intend to visit Himeji again!",

The guide pointed out so many things we would have otherwise not noticed or even understood what it was.

Japan,Himeji Castle,Splendid main keep,"The highlight of the castle is the Main Keep. The main Keep is a wooden building and externally the main Keep appears to have 5 floors. However, it actually has a 7 floor configuration consisting of six internal floors and a basement. At the basement are two toilets and a sink. At the first floor, we saw the decorative covers which conceal nail heads on beams connected to pillars. We also located the stone drops where in the past, allow the throwing of stones and firing on enemy soldiers. On reaching the second floor, we saw a garret room over the entrance and lattice windows which are opened. There are also many weapon racks as the main Keep was used as a weapon stockroom. At the four corners of the 3rd floor are spaces for deploying warriors in an ambush. At the north and south sides of the floor, there are higher positioned windows, so there are stone throwing platforms. High Windows at the 4th floor allowed gun smoke to escape. At the 5th floor, we could see two large pillars, east and west. These pillars extend from the basement level up to the 5th floor beam. The west pillar is rectangular whereas the east pillar is round in shape. The Osakabe Jingu shrine is located on the 6th floor. Be careful when you climb the narrow , steep staircase. From the lattice windows we could see the city, Koko en and the moat. Next we went to the West Balley . We had to walk through a long roofed passsage before getting to the room of Princess Sen. Do look out and note the different types of gates, towers, stone walls, roof tiles , windows, openings on the walls and the shachi.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Stunning Exterior,"Each time I am anywhere near Himeji during my frequent trips to Japan, I try to at least catch a glimpse of this iconic structure, which stands high on a hill. For example, when traveling by bullet train, I find that Himeji’s elevated Shinkansen station provides a nice, but quick view of the 6-story, 150-feet-tall, main keep. When I have the time, I leave the train to spend about an hour walking around the castle’s exterior and admiring what UNESCO considers to be the finest surviving example of early 17th-century castle architecture in Japan. The main keep’s mostly empty interior no longer beckons, especially its narrow, steep stairs, but was certainly worth a look when I first went here.

My most recent visit took place in October when I introduced a traveling companion to this elegant structure. It has earned a nickname of the White Heron Castle, because of its color and because some said the building resembles a bird ready for flight. Constructed of stone and wood, this castle is the largest in Japan and is certainly stark white. Its grounds contain many feudal-era buildings, with the complex, as it appears today, completed in 1609.

Short on time, we opted not to pay the 1,000 ¥ (about $10 U.S.) castle admission charge. Instead we crossed the castle’s inner moat via the Sakuramon footbridge and went through the large, wooden Otemon Gate. This entry route brought us to a huge free admission area, with many photo ops, beneath the castle. Various information boards offered details in Japanese, Chinese and English. Many cherry trees stand here and their blossoms bring huge crowds to the beautiful setting.

We left our luggage in lockers at the Himeji Station and walked along Otemae-dori Street for about 15 minutes to reach the castle. Miyuki Street, a covered shopping arcade that runs parallel to Otemae-dori, was our return route.","Written November 10, 2019"

Some of you are spoiled by the stone-built European castles that you can't understand how hard it is build and maintain the castle using traditional way! Osaka castle is like no history at all compared to Himeji castle. You are supposed to step on the floors in the castles to imagine what was inside and what people were doing using the stuff/stairs/small windows. This is a castle with true spirit, unlike Osaka castle which only told the story of 丰成秀吉 without much link to the castle itself.
Pay some respect to the culture and stop for a while for the instruction they had a lot of places.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Stunning,"My partner and I had an amazing time at himeji castle it was one of the best things about our trip.
Be able to go inside and walk all the way to the top was an experience I will never forget. I will make sure to go back on my next trip to japan",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Majestic Himeji,"A definite must see experience in Himeji. This world heritage site commands the surrounding countryside.
This medieval era fort is great viewing. A word of warning, there are a lot of stairways to the top of the keep and low headroom. Not for those who are claustrophobic or have a fear of heights.
Remarkably this castle never featured in an actual battle.
Numbers can be limited so best to go in off peak times.
Highly recommended","Written October 21, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Magnificent Castle,"Didn't originally plan to your the Castle, but so glad we did. Such an impressive fortification sitting high above Himeji. It's steep climb to the top up to the 6th level but there are lots of interesting facts on the how and why It was built. Then head over to the West Bailey, a 300m long attachment housing apartments and a fascinating film of the restoration work that has been carried out.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,A highlight of my trip,Himeji castle is worth the day trip for sure. The place is stunning. It has all been renewed and so it feels like walking back in time. It is true is empty inside but that gives a chance to truly see the details. If you like architecture and history it is really great. The walking around the castle is also great with lich opportunity to see the roofing details along the way. Beware no strollers are allowed (you couldn't get them anywhere anyway) so you'll have to carry baby for the duration. Still worth it. The views drom the top are beautiful. The western buildings are also worth taking a look for a better idea of lovong quarters instead of a military building. It wasn't too crowded when I visited so I was really able to steep in the days of yore atmosphere. Not to be missed!,"Written October 20, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Well worth the visit,"As soon as you exit Himeji station you can see the castle. It’s striking and exactly what you’d hope for.

The walk there puts the castle in perfect profile. We got there at about 1015 and walked straight in, then through the Long Corridor, and into the castle. There are lots of stairs, some a bit steep but all with handrails on both sides.

It’s fantastic to see the quality of the woodwork in the castle. Great photos and views over the courtyards and over the city",

Japan,Himeji Castle,A ‘Must See’ when in Japan,"This splendid castle, one of only twelve remaining ‘original ‘ castles in Japan is an absolute Must See if you are in Japan. Easily accessible via Shinkansen and a brief walk, the castle is a delight of architecture and history. Be sure to walk up to the top Shrine and absolutely do not miss the Shogun’s Gardens, one of the best in Japan. You’ll definitely put a visit to Himeji as one of the top things you’ll do in Japan.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,A must see in Himeji,"During our day trip to Himeji, a trip to the castle was a must. A spectacular structure steeped in history and beautifully preserved, we learnt so much.

Do note that it’s a steep climb up to the castle and very steep stairs within the castle. It may not be advisable for the elderly or if you families with strollers.

Would definitely recommend making a pit stop to the Himeji castle if you are visiting the town.

Tip: if you have the time, purchase the ticket to the Koko-en gardens as well.",

Japan,Himeji Castle,Old world splendor in modern Japan,"Take a step back in time by visiting this beautiful castle. It's an easy day trip from Kyoto or Hiroshima on the Shinkansen train. Train station has a good number of lockers or varying sizes to store your bags while there. (Locker only accept 100 yen coins so make sure you have a few). Explore the grounds and parks around the buildings, taking in the many photo ops. The main building is a prime example of medieval Japanese wooden architecture. Unfortunately, there are no furnishings in the buildings so you'll just have to imagine how beautiful it must have been. The wooden beams and joints are pretty stunning if you think back in time to when these would have been hand hewn!!! Be advised that the castle is 7 stories high and the wooden staircases between floors are very steep with metal handrails. Be sure to include the gardens in visit, this a few extra Yen on your ticket but well worth it.","Written October 9, 2019"

Japan,Himeji Castle,Amazing FREE English tour,"My best friend and I (both 21) flew alone to japan recently, and one of the best tourist experience we’ve had was at himeji castle. We didn’t plan on going on a guided tour, but walking in a nice man called Hidekazu (hide) Fujisoka Offered to give us a free two-hours tour of the place, in English. He asked for nothing in return, 100% volunteer work, and gave us the most interesting tour of the place possible. Honestly it was such a great experience, I saw the place in a completely different (much more interesting even!) light once I knew about the history behind the castle and the way it was built. Hide sensei was the sweetest guy as well!

If you plan on visiting, I have to recommend finding him at the entrance! Honestly, he made our day. I don’t know how exactly to contact him beforehand, but I added his business card to this review. Can’t recommend enough, truly.","Written October 6, 2019"

Mixed with the modern buildings around Himeji Railway Station, it is a focal point. You need a good pair of shoes and plenty of water. There are lots of steps if you want to see all the available areas. It is up a steep slope which could prove hard with a pushchair.

The long renovation has brought the castle back to its former construction. There are plenty of information plaques in English to enable you to fully appreciate the history attached.

It took us a good 2.5 hours to see everything. It was not busy when we met but there were signs that you could have to wait in line to enter.

Non-refundable lockers are available.

Worthwhile buying a joint ticket for the gardens.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Amazing site superb restoration work,"Took a day off from rugby to visit this magnificent UNESCO World Heritage site. We came from Osaka so about an hour on a rapid train. From the station exit the castle can be seen and a gentle flat walk takes you to the castle.

Japan,Himeji Castle,"Stunning castle from the outside, a long walk inside with a lovely view from the top","A friend of ours that works in Japan recommended we stop here between Hiroshima and Osaka, so we made sure we stopped. You can see the castle from the station and it's an easy 15 minute walk from the station to the castle.

With so many shrines and castles in Japan, I honestly think this was one of the prettiest ones we saw. At least on the outside.... This castle is situated so beautifully. Besides the lovely moat, stonework and gardens surrounding the castle, the castle is still the centerpiece of the town.

Inside, there really isn't anything to do other than walk the many floors of very steep stairs to the top floor. Once at the top, the views of the town are fantastic. We were there in the deep heat of summer, so it was very nice to stand at the windows there and take advantage of any breeze coming through. We'd worked up quite a sweat just walking to the top. There were very few exhibits regarding the history or architecture of the castle, which was somewhat disappointing.

Still, it was a nice short excursion to see a very fine example of Japanese architecture.",

Japan,Himeji Castle,Empty shell,"Sadly I found Himeji Castle a little disappointing, but in saying that, it’s still something you have to visit. The structure itself is impressive, with beautiful wooden floors and massive timber beams, but that’s about all. The AR app wouldn’t work, the QR site was average and there was nothing to see except the view. It was like walking through an empty museum. I enjoyed Matsumoto more, just for the display of armour and weapons. Also if you’re going in summer, arrive early, the heat is crazy.","Written September 9, 2019"

From the outside the castle is very impressive - it has obviously been well looked after. The view from the top of the castle is amazing but you really have to work to get up there, with many steep staircases to negotiate. The interior of the castle is surprisingly bare, which is a real disappointment as other castles have relevant exhibits which add to the experience. Aside from the exterior photo opportunities ad the view at the top, there isn't much else in the castle of interest. We didn't visit the adjacent gardens as the weather was brutally hot, but we have heard they are quite beautiful.","Written August 26, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Surprisingly under-whelming,"Not sure why this famous castle didn't grab us as much as other sites in Japan. Indeed, the temple complex of Mt Shosa - Enkyo-ji just outside town - had more of a wow factor for us and is highly recommended, particularly if you have seen Cruise's Last Samurai. Himeji is a beautiful castle to look at, no doubt, but the interior has little to see and the information in English is poor. There's a VR mobile phone system but you have to have a Japanese Google account to access it. Queues of people climbing the interior narrow stairs mean long waits, which detracts from the experience. So this is more of a seen it / done it location, at least for us.",

Japan,Himeji Castle,Has so much potentil to be excellent - put an exhibition inside!,"This might be the most beautiful castle we've seen so far in Japan. It's beautiful on the outside but we prefer the inside of Matsuyama castle since it wasn't empty and it had things to see and experience like in a museum (samurai sword and clothing, gun, etc.). Matsumoto castle was the one we liked less so far. The stairs are wider and less steep than in the other two mentioned castles so they're easier to climb. They give you a plastic bag to carry your shoes and walk on your socks. It took us an hour and a half and we arrived at 8:30 to have a good place in line when it opened at 9 (it would take longer if you go later with the crowds). The combined ticket (the ticket line is the one to the left when facing the castle) with Koko-en garden was great since we loved the garden maybe even more than the castle. They were the perfect combination.","Written August 23, 2019"

It was just about enough time to see the castle and neighbouring garden and have lunch in the restaurant in the garden. We had no time to look at the shops.

The castle is entirely made of wood and smells lovely inside.

Actually one hour is enough and we were lucky enough to be only a few tourists there (of course great for pics). You have to take off your shoes, they give you a plastic bag for them. There are a lot of stairs, actually it's wooden ladders at some places. So be aware that climbing up to the 6th floor can be pretty strenuous for some people.","Written August 12, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Highlight of our Japan Tour,"I can see why so many tourists visit this place. The castle is very stunning from inside and outside. However be prepared to walk up several flights of stairs if you decide to go inside the castle.

Japan,Himeji Castle,Get there Early!,"We did a day trip from Osaka and arrived at the castle just before 10a.m. on a week day and this was perfect timing as it was just before it got hot and there were very few people there. We did not pay for a tour so that we could take our time and take photos. This is one of the many sites in Japan that requires you to take off your shoes when going inside the castle so I recommend wearing shoes that can be taken off easily. The castle itself is amazing and well worth the visit!
We also purchased the garden ticket along with our castle entrance ticket. This was worth it. The gardens are lovely and they are a nice break from the hustle and bustle of a major city.","Written August 11, 2019"

There are a number of slides explaining the construction techniques and to go inside you must remove shoes for walking on the wooden floors.

The grounds are well maintained and have lovely gardens. The inside was really interesting. You can't wear shoes inside so make sure you are clean socks. The castle is more of a fortress. Everything in it was to keep invaders out. So it is not filled with beautiful furniture or ornate items. There is not really a lot in it.

The highlight of the stay was visiting Himeji Castle,as it is one of the only original castles still standing. We were given a free tour in English, which made it even better. The guide was extremely informative and even spent some time afterwards talking to us about Japanese culture.

We had a great meal at the shopping center across from the castle and topped it off with some matcha ice cream.

As we browsed through the souvenirs afterwards, a concerned Japanese man approached us and told us not to buy anything near the tourist attractions and pointed us to the local discount store. We absolutely love the Japanese frugality!!!","Written July 22, 2019"

If it is raining, there is a parallel street going to the Castle one block east which is totally covered and wonderful for shopping.

Definitely leave your stroller at the bottom because there are over 100 stairs to climb as you tour through the castle. You are required to remove your shoes, but they give you bags to hold them. I would definitely download the free Himeji Castle app which gives you an augmented reality experience of some parts of the castle.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,A Great Example of Japanese Architecture,"Our first view of this amazing castle was while walking down the main avenue from Himeji station. Built high on a hill it is an impressive sight. Unlike most European castles the main keep is finish in white plaster.
If you visit the castle be prepared for a lot of steps if you want to go right to the top but in my opinion the climb is worth every step as it takes you through some great displays of life in castle in a by gone era.
Well worth a visit, don't miss it!",

Japan,Himeji Castle,Highly-impressive Himeji Castle!,"This was my first time to visit a Japanese castle and I can say that I was very impressed. Even from afar, you can see how majestic it was.

From the train station, there's a long walk to reach the castle (maybe 20 min). I could not calculate much because we made a lot of stops to take photos before reaching the castle's complex.

It is highly recommended to buy ticket to enter the castle. There's a ticketing machine and a ticket counter as well.

When you reach the main gate of the castle, don't forget to get the brochure where you can select from variety of languages.
The castle's complex has very good defensive systems in its design and architecture including its several layers of moats.
It's required that you remove your shoes/slippers/sandals to explore the interior of the castle. You either go barefoot or with socks. The stairs to go up were quite steep and extra caution was needed to ascend.
From the inside, you'll get to see the panoramic view of the town and the decoration of the tiled roofs.
Do not get disappointed if you notice that it almost look empty and no furnishings. The beauty lies in the castle itself built with stones and woods and how it survived and restored to its glory.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,As original as it gets!,"I knew I wanted to see inside one Japanese castle whilst I was in Japan and Himeji was a convenient and clear winner. Unlike many other castles that had been re-built or heavily renovated after World War 2, Himeji was almost untouched by the war and therefore had an immediate upper hand as you can actually see structures that are hundreds or years old. It does get super busy so I would recommend trying your best to go to it at off-peak times. That said, the only time I could go was at 3pm on a Saturday (super peak time) and it wasn't horrific. The flow of people was kept under control very well apart from the top floor where everyone ended up in a queue bottle-necked trying to get down the stairs. Still worth it.

FYI - if you have a Kansai One Pass (IC card type) you should be able to get a discount from the entrance ticket. I forgot to show it however so no discount for me!",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Must-see Himeji Castle while in the Kansai area,"We visited Himeji Castle on our way back to Osaka, from an overnight stay in Hiroshima-Mijajima (Note: we bought the JR Kansai West Pass good for 5 days).

We left Hiroshima about 9:00 am, took the Shinkansen train, and alighted at Himeji JR station. We stored our carry-on luggage at the station lockers, and opted to walk to Himeji Castle for about 15-20 mins, while passing by some nice shops (and flower planters) along the way. The Castle can be seen from the rail station.

The approach to Himeji Castle is very scenic--with lots of picture-taking opportunities, with the rickshaw. The walk through the small bridge was delightful, and some cherry blossoms were still in bloom in the Castle grounds.

From the grounds to the Castle requires a bit of walking, and climbing/navigating the 6 floors (7 including the basement) of the Castle can be a challenge--but is doable. The stairs are narrow, and steep, but visitors can opt to return to the ground floor upon reaching a particular floor.

The views from inside Castle is lovely--of the castle grounds and the Himeji area. The inside of the Castle is mostly bare, except for small shrines; however of great interest is the all-wood structure and architecture of the Castle. Upon reaching the 6th floor, there is some sort of monitor which indicates that you have reached the top of the Castle.

There are also shops where to buy drinks/snacks and souvenir items within the Castle grounds.

On existing the Castle grounds, visitors can take a bus/trolley which goes around the Himeji area--on the way to the Himeji JR rail station. Visitors can alight at some nearby places of interests, such as the Botanical Garden.

Japan,Himeji Castle,One of Our Favorite Attractions in Japan,"We spent 5 nights in Himeji and had a wonderful time. The highlight of the stay was visiting Himeji Castle,as it is one of the only original castles still standing. We were given a free tour in English, which made it even better. The guide was extremely informative and even spent some time afterwards talking to us about Japanese culture.

We had a great meal at the shopping center across from the castle and topped it off with some matcha ice cream.

As we browsed through the souvenirs afterwards, a concerned Japanese man approached us and told us not to buy anything near the tourist attractions and pointed us to the local discount store. We absolutely love the Japanese frugality!!!","Written July 22, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Brilliant castle well worth visiting,"We really enjoyed this castle as it is extremely beautiful by also you could see it would be a very effective castle for defence.

We did a day visit from Kyoto and it was very easy to get there and back.

The grounds around the castle looked impressive too but it was a little too hot when we got there so we didn’t stay in the grounds that long.

Our children enjoyed the visit and enjoyed the origami ninja stars that were given to them by a member of staff.","Written July 16, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Most beautiful castle in Japan,"This is an amazing castle high up on a hill in the center of this small city. It is about five blocks north of Himeji Station. If it is raining, there is a parallel street going to the Castle one block east which is totally covered and wonderful for shopping.

Definitely leave your stroller at the bottom because there are over 100 stairs to climb as you tour through the castle. You are required to remove your shoes, but they give you bags to hold them. I would definitely download the free Himeji Castle app which gives you an augmented reality experience of some parts of the castle.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,A Great Example of Japanese Architecture,"Our first view of this amazing castle was while walking down the main avenue from Himeji station. Built high on a hill it is an impressive sight. Unlike most European castles the main keep is finish in white plaster.
If you visit the castle be prepared for a lot of steps if you want to go right to the top but in my opinion the climb is worth every step as it takes you through some great displays of life in castle in a by gone era.
Well worth a visit, don't miss it!",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Beautiful castle,"Lovely castle and gardens with amazing architecture. Pick up a brochure as its worth at least understanding a little of the castle’s history. A short walk directly from Himeji Railway Station. We stopped here and stored luggage on our way between Hiroshima and Osaka. A good wander through the main castle filled in about 2 hours, but you could spend much longer exploring all the grounds. Lovely place. I’d recommend!","Written July 12, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Highly-impressive Himeji Castle!,"This was my first time to visit a Japanese castle and I can say that I was very impressed. Even from afar, you can see how majestic it was.

From the train station, there's a long walk to reach the castle (maybe 20 min). I could not calculate much because we made a lot of stops to take photos before reaching the castle's complex.

It is highly recommended to buy ticket to enter the castle. There's a ticketing machine and a ticket counter as well.

When you reach the main gate of the castle, don't forget to get the brochure where you can select from variety of languages.
The castle's complex has very good defensive systems in its design and architecture including its several layers of moats.
It's required that you remove your shoes/slippers/sandals to explore the interior of the castle. You either go barefoot or with socks. The stairs to go up were quite steep and extra caution was needed to ascend.
From the inside, you'll get to see the panoramic view of the town and the decoration of the tiled roofs.
Do not get disappointed if you notice that it almost look empty and no furnishings. The beauty lies in the castle itself built with stones and woods and how it survived and restored to its glory.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,As original as it gets!,"I knew I wanted to see inside one Japanese castle whilst I was in Japan and Himeji was a convenient and clear winner. Unlike many other castles that had been re-built or heavily renovated after World War 2, Himeji was almost untouched by the war and therefore had an immediate upper hand as you can actually see structures that are hundreds or years old. It does get super busy so I would recommend trying your best to go to it at off-peak times. That said, the only time I could go was at 3pm on a Saturday (super peak time) and it wasn't horrific. The flow of people was kept under control very well apart from the top floor where everyone ended up in a queue bottle-necked trying to get down the stairs. Still worth it.

FYI - if you have a Kansai One Pass (IC card type) you should be able to get a discount from the entrance ticket. I forgot to show it however so no discount for me!",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Must-see Himeji Castle while in the Kansai area,"We visited Himeji Castle on our way back to Osaka, from an overnight stay in Hiroshima-Mijajima (Note: we bought the JR Kansai West Pass good for 5 days).

We left Hiroshima about 9:00 am, took the Shinkansen train, and alighted at Himeji JR station. We stored our carry-on luggage at the station lockers, and opted to walk to Himeji Castle for about 15-20 mins, while passing by some nice shops (and flower planters) along the way. The Castle can be seen from the rail station.

The approach to Himeji Castle is very scenic--with lots of picture-taking opportunities, with the rickshaw. The walk through the small bridge was delightful, and some cherry blossoms were still in bloom in the Castle grounds.

From the grounds to the Castle requires a bit of walking, and climbing/navigating the 6 floors (7 including the basement) of the Castle can be a challenge--but is doable. The stairs are narrow, and steep, but visitors can opt to return to the ground floor upon reaching a particular floor.

The views from inside Castle is lovely--of the castle grounds and the Himeji area. The inside of the Castle is mostly bare, except for small shrines; however of great interest is the all-wood structure and architecture of the Castle. Upon reaching the 6th floor, there is some sort of monitor which indicates that you have reached the top of the Castle.

There are also shops where to buy drinks/snacks and souvenir items within the Castle grounds.

On existing the Castle grounds, visitors can take a bus/trolley which goes around the Himeji area--on the way to the Himeji JR rail station. Visitors can alight at some nearby places of interests, such as the Botanical Garden.

It was a wonderful day in Spring at Himeji, although we missed the full bloom of the cherry blossoms. Plan for about 3-4 hours for the visit.","Written July 9, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,"Marvellous castle, fantastic tour with Fujioka-san","I won't say much about this magnificent castle, except that visiting it is a dream come true to any fan of Japanese history or castles in general.

But I would like to say that choosing a guided tour of the premises with one of fthe English speaking guides adds very much to the experience and will lead to even more admiration of the defensive logic of its design.

We were offered a tour by Hidekazu Fujioka san who is a native of the city, a mild mannered gentleman with humor and very good of English. He asked us how much time we had and whether we wanted the short tour. Upon answering that we had nothing to do for the rest of today, he took us on a tour that lasted somewhere between 3 and 3.5 hours, explaining to us the almost unending series of ambush locations, deceitful desing, ingenius obstacles etc, that were supposed to stop an overwhelming attacking force (though the castle was never beseiged or assaulted). The more he told the more the castle came to life for us. Otherwise we would simply have walked around shaking our heads mumbling 'nice walls, nice gates, nice pathways, nice stairs, nice towers' without realizing the unseen dangers that lurked behind many of its features.

Do not forget to visit the well of Okiku and learn about the legend of a poor girl whose life fell victim to a plate and then turned to an angry spirit.

Thank you Fujioka san!","Written July 8, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Lovely castle with hidden gems,"It is really beautiful and highly recommend picking up at least the guide pamphlet on the way in to understand its rich history. Tickets to the castle and the adjourning ko-koen garden can be bought at the ticket booth, while tickets to the castle only can be bought at the ticketing machine.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Gorgeous castle,"Must visit castle, beautiful castle and city. Its only 1 hour by shinkansen from osaka. We went there day trip and definetly will be back again",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Major bucket list item checked off! There's an app for that!,"My husband and I have wanted to visit Himeji-jo (Himeji Castle) since before we started coming to Japan with the Manjiro Summit in 2007. We've been to many castles in the meantime. It's actually a good thing that we waited, because they did a massive restoration and the roof tiles are white again. It's so beautiful!

Since we had been looking forward to this so much, we bought the castle and garden ticket, signed up for a tour in English, and did some exploring on our own. We got there between the two English tours, so we spent a lot of time in the very reasonably priced gift shop near the entrance, including a $13 Shiromaruhime plushie!

Shiromaruhime is a white ball with Himeji Castle on her head. She's the mascot for the castle and is amazingly cute. I bought a t-shirt of her in the shops across the street at the intersection. They had American sizes and sample shirts.

There's an app for that! There's a Himeji Castle app (it mentions it in the English handout), you click the Self-Guided Tour, and look for signs that say AR (augmented reality). Some have videos that you can download, some let you look through the walls to see how the castle was put together, and some let you look out onto Himeji as it was many years ago. There are also 3 photo ""items"" that you can download (frame, Shiromaruhime, and samurai armor). The AR by the well says ""Look up!"" You look up and there's an obake (ghost) of the lady who died in the well. Yipe!

The castle tour takes you up lots of stairs, so be able to walk up 6 stories (while carrying your shoes in a provided plastic bag). There is a lovely view of the city from the top! Once you start, you're committed, because the entire castle is one way only. It was cool inside, even when it was 85 degrees Fahrenheit outside. We wore moisture wicking clothes.

At the end of the English tour, we got to take pictures with fun outfits. We walked through the princess' wing where we saw a video on the restoration.

There's a small gift shop on your way out. I think it's a little more expensive than the one outside the entrance.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,One of the best in Japan,I've visited most castles in Japan and this is one of my favorite. I was lucky to go when there were no tour groups going through so it was very quiet and comfortable. Highly recommended.,"Written July 1, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Get there early,"I had read the reviews about the queues so arrived just after 9am. Straight through and not many people in the castle and grounds. In June. Cost was 1,040 yen including the gardens. They’re located back out the gate, over the bridge and down to the right (about 3 minutes walk). The castle is basically bare inside. It has QR code scanning for information but it’s a bit limited. There are however free guide pamphlets in a variety of languages at the gate. A read up on the internet is recommended before you go.","Written June 29, 2019"

There was no air conditioning inside. It was quite cool inside.","Written June 28, 2019"

We were lucky to get an amazing English speaking volunteer guide Mr Komatsu who was humorous and knowledgeable. He explained how the castle was supposed to function in the event of a war. Very informative. The walk around the castle took us more than 2 hours and we thoroughly enjoyed it. There are many stairs to climb and would be challenging for older people. I would say it is the most beautiful castle we have seen in Japan. A must visit for tourists going to Himeji.,"Written June 28, 2019"

Japan,Himeji Castle,White Heron Castle,"Even though you can see the castle from the JR train, it’s still about a 25-30 mins walk from the JR Himeji station. This was unbearable on the hot day (when we visited) as there are no shade trees lining the street and we are surrounded by concrete buildings along the way. When it sunny & hot, it’s best to take the city bus or taxi to the castle instead of walking.

We skipped a visit to Osaka Castle in favor of Himeji Castle since it’s one of the original castles (not reconstructed). It is a very regal white castle high up on the hill and very large grounds. We set aside at least 2 hours to leisurely see everything including the Kokoen Garden. Admission is 1040Y (including the garden), more than the Osaka Castle admission at 600Y. Afterwards, it was a short JR train ride to nearby Kobe for a Kobe beef meal.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Absolutely Stunning Structure,"When approaching the castle grounds from across the street, I could tell that this day would be special. I could clearly see the castle in the distance and it was a beautiful sight to see.

We paid the admission fee of 1000y each and began our slow walk up to the castle. I was amazed by the intricate layout of the walkways and gates. They seemed to crisscross each other and was definitely meant to confuse anyone trying to gain entry to the main building. First you are walking in one direction and then you are walking in another direction without knowledge of how you got to where you are. Truly brilliant!

Once inside the main building, the rooms were cramped, dark and barren. Each floor had a stair up to the next level. As you ascended the stairs, the slope of the stairs got steeper and the stair treads and risers got smaller. Whoever had to launch and attack on the upper floors, they had to be very nimble and have small feet. I made it to the top floor, but I had to use the railings on the last three levels.

The view from the top floor is terrific. You can look down Otemae Street from the top floor and see Himeji Station in the distance.The tour route leads you into an outdoor courtyard where you can look out over the grounds and the city. It was a nice spot to look at the beautiful high walls and the castle.

As a person with a construction background, I was totally blown away by the walls of the castle and how they were constructed without any mortar or binding agents. The small rock shims were really cool. Whoever designed this building really had their head screwed on straight back then. I could not imagine building this without a computer.","Written June 25, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Worthwhile the day trip from Kyoto,With the JR railway pass it’s easy to do the 1 hour trip and walk from the station to the castle.

Japan,Himeji Castle,Beautiful castke,This castle is well worth the visit. It is absolutely stunning. You can also buy a ticket that includes the garden. Be prepared to go up lots of steps and also a part of it you need to go without your shoes .. so take socks or walk barefooted. Stunning views. It was very hot so take a cloth and wash it with cold water and keep it with you.,
Japan,Himeji Castle,A breathtakingly beautiful castle,"It was truly beautiful, to say the least. It is quite a climb on to the top. Narrow wooden stairs. Might be a little tough for those with knee problems. Actually, there is nothing much to see inside the castle. The view from the top was really nice though.

Walk around the garden outside the castle. You will be able to take a really nice photo of the castle.

Japan,Himeji Castle,A nice time at an impressive castle,"We took a half-day trip from Osaka, taking the shinkansen took about half an hour, to see Himeji Castle. We also took a taxi to and from the castle as it saved us time waiting for the bus and since there were four of us, it would've cost about the same as taking the bus. When you get to the rail station, you can see the castle in the distance and when you finally get beyond the castle walls, what a sight! It took a bit of walking to get to the castle itself and then many steep stairs to climb within the castle itself. Like a prior review said, there isn't much to see inside the castle itself but what there is to see is very interesting, like where they stored the weapons and also the trap doors. And of course, there are great views of the city below. It was fun walking up and down the stairs, although someone with bad knees might not enjoy it. This is in contrast to Osaka Castle, where you take an elevator up, then walk back down through the exhibits. After we got out of the castle, we took many more photos of the exterior of the castle, then back to the rail station, and a quick trip back to Osaka.","Written June 17, 2019"

Japan,Himeji Castle,Empty and Disappointing,"This was the most disappointing part of my entire trip to Japan. I think it had just been re-opened after a refurb but hardly any of it is original. The crowds are manic (I went in November).

When you enter the castle itself it is just empty wooden rooms. Not sparsely decorated or only a few bits to look at.. it’s literally empty. So you go in and join a huge queue (about 5-6 wide) and walk extremely slowly, with many stoppages) up some stairs into more empty rooms. Then down again and out. The grounds themselves are a little bit better and have that wonderful and quintessential Japanese feel and wonderful finish but there’s nothing really to see. And I like going to temples and these kinds of places!

Really disappointing.","Written June 14, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,A castle with a smart defense system that was never used.,"Along with Matsumoto and Kumamoto Castle, Himeji Castle is one of Japan's three best castles, and UNESCO world heritage site (1993) The White Heron castle is a real star of cinema. The great Akira Kurosawa filmed here his Japanese interpretation of ""King Lear"" ""Ran"" and ""Kagemusha"" (Shadow warrior), received the ""Palm D`Or"" in Cannes. Sean Connery was spying on a ninja school in ""You Only Live Twice"", the fifth in the James Bond series. White plaster covers the outside of its walls and is even used to give stability to the roof tiles. Thanks to it, the castle got its romantic name. It is built on a hill called Hime-Yama and is surrounded by a plain. Tensyukaku (main tower) is a symbol of power of the owner of the castle. 7-tier 46-meter donjon is built on the highest place and was a convenient point for observing the possible movement of the enemy in the area. The area around the main tower was the most important part of the castle and was called honmaru (main fence). Political life took place here. The living quarters were behind the 2nd and 3rd fencing. The profile of the walls of Himeji differs from European castles. They are steeply up, curving in the upper part to the outside. they are very difficult to climb-for this curvature, which is called OGI-no-kobay (slope folding fan), 7-tier 46-meter donjon However, if the enemy is already climbing the walls, the battle is almost lost. Most of the attackers must be destroyed in front of the walls. The holes in the walls are designed for this. Oblong loopholes for archers, square for muskets. This is in most castles not only in Japan, but also in other countries. The ""trick"" Himenji gardens in the form of mazes with lots of dead ends in front of the castle. Moving to the donjon, you need to loop, from time to time moving away from it, which gives the impression of movement in the wrong direction, even when you approach it. First, it is highly demoralizing, and secondly, the warriors are shot out of bows and muskets. It is the invention of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the unifier of Japan, to which the castle passed in 1581. Political measures Hideyoshi stopped internecine war and protected castle better walls and maze. The castle of The white Heron has lost its military importance. American bombers bombed it in 1945, burned down the whole neighborhood, but the castle itself is fortunately missed. Admission is 1000 yen.The castle has no any reservation systems, that`s why you need to stand in line. During summer and vacations it can take around 1 hour. We would be willing to stand, but Japan Rail has prepared us another, third surprise for the trip. Railways blocked, Shikansen stopped for four hours by suicide. We got to Himeji in the evening and were forced to confine ourselves to external examination.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,UNESCO World Heritage Site -- A must-see!,"We visited Himeji Castle as part of our 12-day tour with Gem Japan Tours (highly recommended!). It is a magnificent structure, and the grounds are beautiful. We were fortunate to visit in late May, after the cherry blossoms had fallen, and so we didn't have to face large crowds.

We didn't think to supply ourselves with water before we began the climb up to and through the castle, and our energy began to flag the higher we climbed. However, we caught a lot of nice, refreshing breezes, and the views were tremendous from high in the castle. If you go, do yourself a favor and grab a water bottle from the concession before you start your tour.

Our Gem Japan Tour guide escorted us around and through Himeji Castle, relating a lot of history and legend as well as information about the engineering and construction of the castle. Although the castle is empty of furnishings, there is still plenty to enjoy in my opinion. I enjoyed climbing the steep stairs, and I especially enjoyed watching very elderly Japanese tourists climb the stairs with relative ease.

If it is high tourist season, I might not enjoy the visit so much with large crowds. There is a shrine on the top floor of the castle, and a lot of visitors linger there to make offerings and to pray, which creates a logjam that results in people being stuck on the stairs between floors. There doesn't seem to be an obvious escape route from this one-way tour of the castle, so once you've entered you are committed to the end, and heavy crowding could cause some people some discomfort, anxiety, or frustration. Know yourself and your physical and mental limits, and take a reading of the crowd size before you commit to entering the castle.","Written June 8, 2019"

So many twists and turns to throw off any potential attackers! So much so that it was never actually attacked during its time in power. I couldn’t recommend this enough! As someone who loves castles, this is one of the most impressive I have visited! Definitely worth checking out for the historical value and awe-inspiring structure itself!",
Japan,Himeji Castle,An inside view of ancient woodwork,"If you're thinking that visiting this castle will give you an insight into Japanese warrior living/artifacts then you will be disappointed. Visiting Japan's largest castle is more about seeing how the castle was structured and built. The interior woodwork is amazing for its beam sizes and how they are connected and massive floorboards. Be prepared for some narrow and steep stairways and slow queues especially as you near the top level. The views from the top especially of the tilework is interesting. You can see a replica of the 'tiger-headed fish (sachi) along the main street in front of the castle leading to Himeji station.
I recommend getting the combined castle and garden ticket as the garden next door is well worth a visit. Be sure to allow at least 2 hours or better still 3 hours for the combined visit as the crowd in the castle can move very slowly.","Written June 5, 2019"

Japan,Himeji Castle,Historic Gem,"This is a wonderfully maintained wooden structure and gives a great appreciation of the period construction. On the tour they have a video of the renovation that was recently done which follow the original methods.

The defense strategy of continuously turn attackers sideways to make them more vulnerable to the defenses is fascinating. The castle is about 1 hour from Kobe on the JR rapid express and is only a 10 minute walk from the station.

It’s well worth the time to see. Plan on a 2 hour tour.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,"Very impressive castle, worth a visit","We were travelling from Osaka to Okayama and stopped at Himeji. The castle is worth a visit. It has a very rich history and was not so much damaged during WOII.

They weighed everything and total weight of keep is 5700 tons!We took train from Kobe port from cruise ship. Once you get to Kobe station, JR train goes to Himeji every 30 minutes as does the return train- about $35 for two people round trip. Don’t worry about bullet trains unless you have a longer trip planned.
Not to be missed!",
Japan,Himeji Castle,A fairytale castle with WOW factor.,"We decided to stop here on the way to Kyoto from Hiroshima and I am very glad we did. We traveled on the early morning bullet train to ensure we secured an entry ticket (limited numbers are sold). We left our luggage at the train station and walked to the castle (approx 1km). It is a magical castle straight out of a fairy tale book. The inside quarters of the castle was very cramped with tourists but still impressive to see. We visited in cherry blossom season, so the gardens were beautiful.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,You must see this castle!,"While visiting Kyoto, we took a day trip to Himeji via the Shinkansen(which is pricy, but at 168mph worth it and in itself an amazing experience).

We travelled by rapid train from Osaka.
Conserving energy until arrival at the castle.which appearing white and majestic is like the stuff of fairytales....
We climbed the seven floors of the castle- whilst Motoko enlightened us on samurai history and hierarchy and the building techniques employed in the castle. We then descended the seven floors( no elevators)....not for the faint hearted 😊

Saying this, the Himeji Castle was one of the best sites we visited in Japan.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Lovely castle - even better with an English Speaking (Volunteer) guide,"My fifth visit to Himeji-jo, first in many years - the queuing was made palatable by the wealth of information our lovely volunteer guide gave us as we went up the numerous flights of stairs/ladders. He was awesome - and loves the castle and its many details - as well as its historical context (and loved imparting that knowledge).

We went there during Sakura blossoms season. There're definitely too many tourist from around the world. The wait time to go inside the main keep was around 1 hour. So, we recommended to go there early to take as much time as possible and enjoy!","Written May 7, 2019"

Amazing architecture with mostly tongue and groove construction. Also stroll the nearby gardens to picnic and see the autumn colours. Postcard pictures of Osaka Castle and Himeji Castle look the same, but Osaka Castle is a reconstruction whereas Himeji Castle is the original. Postcards do not do Himeji Castle justice. The traveller must go see, experience it, and be taken back in time to fully appreciate it.","Written May 7, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Awesome Castle!,"The castle is spectacular, one of the most see sights if you are near Himeji. The city is literally based around this castle and you can see that there is a lot of history in this place. There is a moat around the place when you first enter. The walls surround this place like... what you would expect for a castle. There is a nice little gift shop before you enter the castle. Once you enter the castle, you can see the interiors of the individual buildings such as the guard towers. The smell of tatami is strong in this place, especially near Senhime's room. The castle itself is windier than expected. Also, the amount of assassin hiding places. There is a story about the stones of Himeji, that they didn't have enough stones to build the fortress. So an old lady donated a stone to the castle. This prompted civilians from across the country to donate stones to build the castle. The wood of the castle comes from Taiwan. During world war 2, this was used as a garrison, but it was never touched during the bombings. Anyway, visit this place, this castle has so much history.","Written May 7, 2019"

Crowds were manageable (visited castle Sunday afternoon and grounds again Monday morning), the sight of the white and gray castle with the cherry blossoms is a once in a lifetime experience. The throngs of tourists, local and foreign added to the experience. Seeing old friends sitting on a park bench sharing a box of chocolates, beers, and bento boxes (depending on the bench bench) under the ephemeral haze of cherry blossoms a poignant reminder of what it means to be alive.

We arrived on a Sunday afternoon and departed Monday morning from Himeji. Really worth an overnight stay with plenty of good restaurants + Kokoen garden.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Magnificent castle,"Accessible readily from Osaka a visit is highly recommended
The castle floats above its grounds like a glorious confectionary
The stone work in the walls is amazing and the techniques used clearly explained
Thereis enough information in English for interested foreigners although the interior is bare it gives a feeling for what it must oncehave been like
Elements of the structure are explained in small side displays
The bailey a long narrow building is worth a visit to get a feeling for what living there must have been like
There are quite steep steps through out the castle and no access for strollers or wheelchairs
Busy but there is an attempt to control the throng in the keep
We did not bother with the top levels as the queue was hundreds of people long and we had other things to do

Japan,Himeji Castle,Beautiful!,There is so much to see at this beautiful place. We were told it would take about three hours to walk around the castle but it took us nearly a whole day.,
Japan,Himeji Castle,Amazing Cultural Site,Get ahead of the crowds by being there when the ticket line opens at 9 am. Be sure you’re in good physical shape to meet the challenge of ascending paths & multiple stairs within the castle. This amazing UNESCO World Heritage Site is awesome to behold.,
Japan,Himeji Castle,Spectacular visual feast,This castle is an amazing sight to behold. It has been used in several films and is a UNESCO heritage site. It has been renovated over the years. The setting in gardens is wonderful. It is a steep climb up many sets of stairs inside and in my opinion it is many appreciated as a visual feast from the outside.,
Japan,Himeji Castle,Incredible even without entering!,"This castle is big. Not just big but MASSIVE. No photo taken of it exists that depicts just how imposing it is. You have to stand in front (well below) it to understand. So beautiful.
We didn't bother going inside as I wouldn't have made the trip up, let alone back down.

Surprisingly on our way out I found the best part of visiting this location. We nearly walked past it as the set of stone stairs at the base doesn't even offer a hint of what lies beyond. We came across the most beutiful nature setting we've seen in Japan to date. A mixture of plant life (including cherry blossoms of course) that was simply magical! The backdrop and grounds of this area was a carpet of cherry blossom petals that looked like something out of a painting. It was hard to believe. Amazing.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Scenic castle within easy reach of Osaka,"Visited here during the cherry blossom season so the area was filled with colorful trees dotting the landscape. It was an easy train ride from Osaka to here. With all the tourists visiting to see the cherry blossoms, it was crowded but manageable. Bot sure I would wait in line to go up to the top of the castle as I enjoyed the view of the castle from outside more than the view from the top of the castle looking down onto the castle grounds. Something to note if you are in a rush. What makes this trip convenient if traveling from Osaka is that you pass Kobe along the way. We managed to hit both on the same day trip.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Among the most spectacular castles in Japan,"Himeji castle (locals also call it Heron castle - Shirasagijo) is almost unanimously considered to be Japan's most spectacular castle. It is also a national treasure and protected as a World Heritage Site. It is one of only 12 original Japanese castles that has never been destroyed by war, fire or natural disasters. When visiting make sure to enter the grounds too. You have to pay for a ticket but it is well worth it. I was there first time in 2008 but the interior of the castle went through a renovation in 2015 and is now even more spectacular.","Written April 23, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,What an amazing sight,"This Castle , built in the 15thC, is known as the “ white Heron” because of the soaring pagoda style roofing, which resembles the local bird ...
It’s a massive structure, protected by a large moat, & 3 separate defensive stone walls .... one of them concave .... to make it more difficult for hostile armies to penetrate .

The sight of the Castle, perched on a hill high above Himeji City , & surrounded, when we saw it in April ... with beautiful Sakura ... was one to behold .

I saw information about Himeji online and decided to take the hour long train ride to go see it.

The castle was probably the most amazing site I got to see during my two week visit to Japan. Definitely worth the one hour train ride from Osaka.

Hint: If you're coming from either Osaka or Kyoto and you're not Japanese, buy the one day ""JR West Kansai Wide Pass"" to get here. You will need to bring your passport to the JR Ticket office to buy it in order to prove that you're a foreigner.","Written April 21, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Excellent but so busy,"Himeji castle is an original castle so it is worth going out of your way to visit it. Most other castles in major places like Osaka or Hiroshima etc. are all reconstructions. Because Himeji castle is original all the surrounding buildings are gates are intact and the main tower of the castle is much larger than other castle and the interior is all original. The only downside is that because it is one of Japan's major tourist attractions there are huge numbers of visitors and the queue to get up and through the main tower of the castle can be very long, although you can go through parts of the castle on the way. Inside is very busy and it can take a long time to get through. At the top is very busy and it is hard to see out of the windows because there are always people in the way.","Written April 21, 2019"

Japan,Himeji Castle,Way too crowded! Hard to enjoy.,"The outside of the castle is pretty amazing, the inside less so.
The crowds are enormous and it's really hard to enjoy the castle, feels like Disneyland.
If you're traveling to Himeji specifically for the castle, you better enjoy extreme crowds.

They should really limit the amount of people who go through daily.","Written April 18, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,So Beautiful!,"The Castle grounds were lovely in spring, so many great photo spots! The castle itself is beautiful too, and I loved the details and architecture. But inside looked pretty lonely and empty, devoid of any furniture to make it look like how it would have been in the past. This was a pity.
Having said that, here's a tip, if you have young kids, go super early, preferably before 10am. Crowds build up later and there will be queues. We went early on a Sunday and though there was already a queue, it was acceptable for us. Wear socks as you would be required to remove your shoes and place them in plastic bags given. There are also many stairs in the castle to climb to go to the upper levels and the stairs are pretty steep. Would have to be careful.
After visiting the castle, there was a flea market and a fair just across the street. Not sure if it is a regular feature, but it was lovely.","Written April 17, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Keep your expectations in check and enjoy!,"First off, this is an excellent castle and well worth a time. Book an English-speaking guide for the castle (they are free of charge but small gifts are appreciated) to get the most out of it. These tours take about 3 hours, and the guides will be able to tell you things about the castle you won't be able to find by just looking around.

Some reviewers that say you don't need to go inside - I disagree completely. I imagine the reason many say that is because they expect to see a museum full of exhibits inside. Go inside Himeji Castle and you'll see very few. Keep in mind this an original castle (one of 12 left in the country), and not a reproduction. The castle is intended to be preserved in the same state as it was back in the 1500s, so you get an idea of how the castle looked and functioned in those times.

If your intention is to see a castle with lots of exhibits inside, then this is not the castle for you. However, if you want to see one of the best examples of a Japanese castle complex, then this *is* the castle for you.","Written April 16, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Yes you do need to go inside!,"Our last several visits to Himeji did not allow us to enjoy the grandeur as the castle was wrapped in scaffolding. This time, lo and behold it was in it's full glory.

Cherry blossoms all round, herds of people and grounds packed with picnickers. You get it, lots of people.

True our visit inside was not as memorable as our first due to the sea of humanity but I would still argue that if you do not go inside the castle and climb to the 6th floor you have done your self a disservice. Granted you need to be able to climb and descend steep steps however if you can you must go in.

Expansive grounds, lovely gardens, beautiful castle. Completely and utterly worth your time to visit and explore.","Written April 16, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Beautiful during cherry blossoms,The outside of the castle and grounds were beautiful during cherry blossom season. I'm not sure if it's worth paying to tour the castle.

The view is also amazing, but the building itself is truly the main attraction. The only thing me and my friend was missing was the lack of objects inside the main castle. It was a bit too empty on some places, but that is just something minor.
I really recommend this place!",

Like most sights at this time of year (or maybe always?) arrive early for a less crowded experience. We got there at 9:30, even from Kyoto. Expect to spend closer to 3 hours to get the full experience of the castle without rushing.
No need to stay in Himeji. It is an easy day trip from either Kyoto or Osaka, on the Shinkansen, and a short walk straight up the main street from the station.

Regardless though the views of the castle, as well as from inside, are really something to behold. You can marvel at the technology used to build it, the sheer scale of it, the beautiful blossoming trees and when the wind comes up a bit, the shower of blossoms blowing across you.

Walking up and down each floors was an amazing experience. Make sure to also visit the other halls around the castle.

Too many people from a health and safety perspective and borderline more than I was comfortable with. In the event of an issue it would be very difficult to clear the building quickly as there are only two very narrow staircases, up and down and a lot of elderly people visit. There are a lot of steep stairs, be warned. You have to remove your shoes on entry and the floors were cold; you may wish to wear two pairs of socks! All said, it is a spectacular building and the visit was well worth it. Just plan your visit time sensibly.","Written March 28, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Arrived just as it was opening and got round it promptly,"I had been worried by the horror stories of long lines but I visited just prior to the cherry blossom season and first thing on a Monday morning. It was very quiet.

I was amongst the first visitors to the main keep and had plenty of time to enjoy the surrroundings and take pictures.","Written March 25, 2019"

You simply walk up to the top through tiny stair cases even removing your shoes at some poins, totally different to Osaka castle where there is so much to see inside.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,Get a guide,"We got an independent guide quite by accident. She approached us in the courtyard before we got tickets. Usually in Europe I wouldn't go for these sort of ad hoc street soliciting.
This elderly lady was amazing!!! She really knew her stuff. English was on point. She did it for fun to stay occupied. And unlike guides who just recite the same thing, she could easily field my questions and deal with it.
I would highly recommend getting a guide in some shape or form (even electronic). Otherwise you will kiss the real thought and beauty if the castle beyond the visually aesthetic Instagram shot.","Written March 22, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,Most beautiful castle in Japan,"We have visited quite a few castles in Japan and our verdict is Himeji Castle is the best among all.

Japan,Himeji Castle,Magnificent castle,"One of the few castles in Japan that remains more or less in its original state. You can see it from far off and it gets even better looking as you approach. Visitors are allowed inside the castle keep but you have to remove your shoes before entering - no surprise there, this is Japan after all. The steep stairs do not make going up (or down) all seven levels easy, but we saw an 88-year-old grandma do it so there’s no excuse not to do the same.",

This castle is very masculine and it is easy to imagine the samurais living in it. We just missed the cherry blossom season so on the one hand we could just imagine how beautiful it would look like with everything in pink.

However, it was a super attraction to see on a fine afternoon.",

Japan,Himeji Castle,Wonderful place - even in the rain,"This place is worth making the effort to get to. In our case, it was pouring with rain but the castle itself is magnificent. We learnt lots - including how to climb extremely steep stairs in Japanese slippers which was quite an effort! We were lucky to be there on the last day of the special opening of the west keep - only done in Feb each year so we saw more of how the rooms were connected.","Written March 6, 2019"

Japan,Himeji Castle,Free tour guides!,"This is the most beautiful castle in the world. Be advised that there are FREE tour guides in English at Himeji. It is important to ignore the person outside the ticket booth selling $10 tours, this is not the real tour! After buying a ticket to the castle enter the grounds and walk past the ticket booth, immediately turn left and you will find a FREE tour guide window in English. These tour guides are members of a 50-person historical society dedicated to Himeji castle.

My tour guide, Midori, was beyond wonderful to me! I received a personalized 2 hour tour of the castle; just her and me. Himeji was built with many secrets to surprise attackers, so I would have never noticed them without Midori's impressive knowledge to point them out. I am very grateful for her kind tour!

I did not find any pushy sales people in Japan. The Castle was awesome from the outside but on the inside , not so much. Maybe, we expected it to be like an European castle but it was not. One more thing, you need to take your shoes off and they give you slippers to walk on quite slippery and steep wooden steps. Once you start walking up there there is no way to turn back without going all the way to the top.","Written February 21, 2019"

Japan,Himeji Castle,Unique in the world,"Himeji Castle is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and rightly so. The castle is a wonder, and very much worth the visit. Japan Rail makes it easy, with simple connections and (of course) utterly reliable service. The day we arrived, the castle was not crowded, even though it was a Sunday and we saw ropes and signs related to crowd management. When it is crowded, a visit might be less pleasant. We had hoped to visit the garden, too, and got tickets that included the garden, but unfortunately it started raining while we were inside, so we skipped the garden. Nonetheless, we found the castle visit very much worth it. The ‘augmented reality’ things seemed mostly gimmicky, and it is true that there is not much explanation about the various rooms and floors, but you really don’t need much explanation to appreciate the wonder that is Himeji Castle.","Written February 20, 2019"

Japan,Himeji Castle,Majestic,"We made a day trip to Himeji from Hiroshima using the 7 day kansai west pass. It was a long but fruitful walk from the JR station to the castle as we stopped by souvenir shops and a nice restaurant serving beef bowls. The castle grounds are huge and takes a long time to cover everything including the long corridor. There is only one way up and another way down. Once inside, we must take off our shoes and change into special slippers that are provided for us. They will give us a bag to put our own shoes in which we will need to carry throughout the visit until we leave the main keep. Steps are very steep and narrow so it's not for the faint hearted. The view at the top of the keep is not that fantastic but it's a good exercise to climb up anyway.",

It is visible in the far distance when leaving the Main Station, after arriving amidst an industrial landscape. Suddenly there are wide boulevards reminiscent of Paris or L'viv, and one can easly walk the 1 km to the entrance to the Castle Park. The nearer one gets, the more impressive the view of the castle becomes. When the cherry blossom is out in April, it is one of most magnificent sights imaginable. There are masses of shops off the main walk up to and back from the Castle, which are well worth investigating! If you have time, you can walk most of the way to the Castle under cover, taking in all the retail outlets on the way!

Japan,Himeji Castle,"""White Heron"" Castle Exceeds Expectations","The last time we were in Japan, Himeji was under construction, so I wasn't going to miss it this time in all its glory. We arrived in Himeji after a brief 1-hour train ride from Kyoto Station, and the moment we exited the station, Himeji was visible. The 10-15-minute walk up the main thoroughfare to the gate gets more and more exciting and is one of those walks where you stop every few moments to take a picture, even though you know they're not great.

Adult entry fee is 1000 yen and well worth it. We paid 1040 yen for entrance to the gardens next door as well. There are brochures in a number of languages and free guides, but we wanted to wander at our own pace as much as possible (I have a chronic foot injury, so I'm very cautious at these sites, especially as you must take off your shoes when inside).

Additionally, Himeji has neat AR (augmented reality) spots throughout the grounds where you can scan a code and see an image and get info for various spots. We didn't do this but saw others who did.

The immensity of Himeji is hard to fathom, with all of the towers, walls, auxiliary buildings, etc., but climbing up to the top gives you a great idea of how important its location was and how intimidating it must have been (and still is). Wandering the grounds is peaceful and quiet, even though there were big crowds in the main keep. I think many people must do the main keep and then let kids run around outside, which is great.

All in all, Himeji was one of those travel moments that seems a dream - an icon of Japan, I never really thought I'd see it myself, and I'm so very glad I did. An excellent day trip from Kyoto, we also caught a small festival procession in one of the many shopping streets near the station.

A note: while I am not anywhere near disabled, as I mentioned, I do have a foot injury but was still able to navigate Himeji well and saw many elderly people doing the same. The main keep is not accessible for those in wheelchairs, but the grounds certainly are.",
Japan,Himeji Castle,A White Castle away from the crowd,We were in beautiful Kyoto but the crowd!! Looking for a breather we made an impromptu decision to go to Himeji. A wide boulevard led one's eyes to the Castle sitting on a low hill towering above the city. A white castle! The open castle ground is such a pleasant break from the crowd-everywhere Kyoto. We caught an English guided tour and were treated with colourful descriptions of the history and design of the wooden castle that was built around two massive wooden columns. We got to climb the six levels and were rewarded with a beautiful panoramic view. The air is fresh and view is clear. the rest of the city is similarly delightful. The Ko-ko-En garden has one of the most beautiful fall colours. Certainly the antidote for the crowd-affected tourist.,"Written January 15, 2019"
Japan,Himeji Castle,A “must see”,As soon as you exit the train station it is in front of you looking more majestic the closer you get. An easy walk to the castle via the Main Street or the arcade to the right of the station,
Japan,Himeji Castle,Majestic Historical Japanese Castle,"It is a castle that can be easily seen once you stepped outisde the JR Himeji Station. It is walkable from there for about 10 minutes (depending on the pacing). But there are also buses running in the city starting from the station. Fee is flat for the first 2 stations (100 yen).

The park inside is clean and has 2 attractions. Himeji zoo and the castle itself. Depending on the amount of visitors, long queues could form. You can start on the west gate towers then going to the main keep.
The main keep is a 6 storey structure with steep stairs (not advisable for senior or with weak lower body strength), but this is understandable as the authorities wanted to preserved the structures and show its original form as much as possible.
The flow tends to slow down once the top most floor is reached due to the amount of tourist and visitors wanted to take the city view of Himeji from the inside of the castle.
After the main keep, you can go to the east tower of the castle.
There are souveneirs at the base and vending machines.
Reminders:
- No drinking and eating inside
- No toilet in the main keep of the castle
- There are also tours done in english
- You need to take of your footwear when entering the structures. A plastic bag will be provided for you to carry your footwears.",

Japan,Himeji Castle,Majestic! Beautiful!,"I had a slow walk, about 20min from Himeji Station to Himeji Castle. Do not worry about the directions. Once you are at the station you can ask the station staff or just look at the signage above you & you will not go wrong.

The Castle is already visible when you walk on the street towards it. There is a nice shopping mall outside the train station as well as some shopping streets toward your destination. There are many eateries on both sides of the streets, even at the back of the alleys. Those restaurants & pubs lying at the back only open in the evening.

Before you hit Himeji Castle, you will arrive at the town square. Should you want to try a trishaw ride, ask for a good price. I didn’t try but I saw tourists were talking to these strong men about some pricings. There are many small shops in the square too. Some sell nice umbrellas which I bought a few (the staff could speak good English), other shops sell souvenirs. There are restaurants there too.

The external path & garden of the castle was already so breathtakingly beautiful. Though the sky was gloomy that day, my phone camera didn’t quite stop clicking at the scenery. At every angle I viewed, the castle was so majestic & beautiful. Some trees were already turning red.

I didn’t have the chance to visit the inside of the castle as the queue was very long. More tourists were joining behind me and I gave up willingly. Hence, I spent more time strolling in the clean park. Air was fresh as it was breezy.

I wasn’t disappointed at all. After all, the entire compound was so nice for a stroll. There were some structures erected at the open field which meant for the upcoming lights-up. I spent about 2 hours all in all.

On the way back to the train station, I walked on the left street. I stopped at a small eatery selling udon. I had a simple but economical bowl of tempura udon. It was satisfying in this breezy weather.",

Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Such a disappointment after Hiroshima,"The scale model of the Bomb, time-lapse of the Explosion (ghoulish or what), the Display about the History of Nuclear Bomb Development, its Testing and their proliferation around the World since - they were good.

The rest, I regret to say, was a big disappointment, as was the crowds inside (over-exited & out-of-control School Children, all in immaculate School Uniform comprising the majority). I have to stress, this was an exception - only time on 7 weeks.

Being incredibly rushed, on a -round day Trip from Fukuoka, due to an error in Tour Planning, did not help, but this Museum compared very poorly with Hiroshima.",
Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Destruction and Rebirth,"A friend and I visited this moving museum on a weekday morning in early October. We had come to see how Nagasaki portrayed the effects of the Aug. 9, 1945, atomic bomb drop on the city. The curators have chosen to tell a story, presenting Nagasaki before the bomb fell; immediately after the explosion; and today. They weave explanations of historical details within the story and show what happened through photos, videos, artifacts and much more. The conclusion focuses on the need for peace and the end of nuclear weapons, made abundantly clear by the bomb's destruction of the city and the killing of at least 74,000 people. Those, who survived, would often have to endure physical ailments from the radiation and psychological trauma.

As soon as I entered the exhibition hall, I felt uneasy, looking at a giant black-and- white photo of Nagasaki as it appeared before the bomb fell. That's because I knew what would be ahead for the thriving city. A recovered wall clock frozen at 11:02 a.m. soon appeared, marking the exact time that the horrors began. Displays feature English descriptions and include photos of the atomic wasteland that Nagasaki became, along with stories of that fateful day from survivors, including heroic rescue work. Artifacts damaged from the flash of heat range from a 14-year-old girl's lunch box with rice charred from the fire to six green glass bottles melted at the top and stuck together, which were found in a store's ruins. A helmet with the remains of a skull inside is one of the more grisly items.

I found information on the bomb itself to be especially interesting. A life-size model of the one used on Nagasaki is displayed and called ""Fat Man,"" because of its appearance. A video shows the military loading Fat Man and transporting it to the plane for the mission. There is also a photo taken from the plane that shows the mushroom cloud rising into the sky after the blast.

We went through the relatively small museum in about 1 hour. It cost 200 Y (about $1.89 U.S.) to enter. A corridor leads from the museum to the adjacent Nagasaki National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims. There is no fee to enter the Memorial Hall. Both are located near ground zero for the blast and the Nagasaki Peace Park. To reach the museum, we took the blue line to the Matsuyamamachi tram stop and then walked for about 4 minutes.","Written September 13, 2020"

Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Sad but it happened on 9Aug1945,"This place tells us the history from the victims’ angle. After coming here, i am very upset with human mankind, especially towards the Americans. Why would somebody approved to build such devastating bombs that could inflict so much harm to human mankind. And how could the then President approve to release such bombs on innocent victims? The WW2 was ended when Enola Gay dropped the bomb on Hiroshima against the military there, but why Nagasaki when there were so many non-military and civilians? I just cannot understand but life has to move on....let this be history and a lesson for humanity.
Come visit this museum and learn to know what actually happened here in 1945.","Written January 25, 2020"

9 August is a very sad day for the city.
Interesting with the museum being packed with teenage school students, how the entry of Japan into WW2 is downplayed. If you do not fully know your history then lessons from the past will be forgotten. I gather that current Japan history books used in schools also have this slant.","Written November 21, 2019"

Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Remember...,"You know, this is the one of the most heavy feeling places I ever visited.
Museum of Atomic Bomb you can call Museum of Peace. Call to the Peace. Call through a pain, fear, despair of war. A demon that turn people to an evil creatures that murdering men, women, children, old ones. Turning moms, dads, sons, daughters to an ashes and burned corpses bleeding and crying because of the unbearable pain.
You seems to be transferred in time.
Dark room and a lot of photos. Common photos of common morning of common people. Owner prepare his shop to open. Children goes to school. Janitor cleaning streets. Trams are ready to start a line. Common morning of common people... you almost hear a laugh of scholars, noise of milk truck engine, water rings in a river and wind whispers in a leafs of a trees... but... you hear a clock.
Tick-tock-tick-tock. Boys are running in a school.
Tick-tock-tick-tock. Taxi driver is open a door of his car.
Tick-tock-tick-tock... soon... soon... a bombers are already here. Soon... tick-tock...
And in a moment morning city with all it’s people turns into an ash...
“Water, water, give me a water, please, I beg you...” and a men gives a water to a burned young girl, she drinks it once and dying with only one word “thank you”...
All this place just staying in a water. Memorial with tens of thousands lights that are shining under a thin layer of water. Fountain of the Peace is a wings of water, hundreds bottles of water under monuments... living now people seems to ask them sorry and bringing water to a souls...
So much feels a pain... and feel of lump in throat that bitter unbearably...
If only there were no war... If only there would no war.

Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Poignant but...,"Predictably you come away with a profound melancholy despite a certain lack of balance in how the story is told.

Have never understood how the second bomb was justified (except by an inhumane desire to compare uranium and plutonium variants). But had forgotten Nagasaki was a secondary target with little strategic value, especially compared to Kokura, the prime target. And how only a momentary break in the cloud permitted the eventual drop.

All that said the storyboards and the videos have precious little to say about the inhumanity which gave weight to proponents of the weapon’s use. Visitors from the Philippines and Korea with engrained family lore to factor in may find the presentation wanting.","Written October 10, 2019"

Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Solemn and appropriate,"We travelled across town to visit this museum. My wife wasn't too sure she wanted ro go, but we decided we should. In the end, we were glad we visited.

Unlike Hiroshima, Nagasaki was an interesting place before it was bombed, so it is possible to visit the city without coming to the A-Bomb Museum. Last time I was, it was a rather rickety display on the second floor of a former school house. Now it is in a splendidly appropriate purpose-built building, with carefully designed exhibits, pointing up the horrors of atomic bombing and, in the final exhibition area, the ongoing danger posed by nuclear arsenals.

There were not many people around, so the atmosphere was pretty still and quiet. We wandered at will through the horrific exhibits, with ample opportunities to record our impressions. In all, we spent about 90 minutes there, and were pretty glad to emerge into the spring air.","Written April 22, 2019"

Reminds you why revenge war is never good although I sense there's a bit of downplay of the root cause of this - the Japanese invasion into southeast asia.

Well maintained museum with a good part of the exhibits neatly translated.
The last part of the exhibit about US's role on making the atomic bomb is mainly in Japanese when 90% of the exhibits are well translated in English - wonder what they don't want foreigners to read.

Wish they could have ended the exhibition by acknowledging the wrongs of the Jap invasion and how innocent citizen lives are made to pay for the price of the invasion.

I think the Japanese youth of today should be told this story and be able to refute what our local guide told us that the US had the A bomb and wanted to try it out somewhere to see what happened.

Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Japan is not a victim.,"As per the other reviews, the horrible tragedy that struck Nagasaki city and its people are well described via chilling photos and relics. It’s certainly moving and designed to evoke strong emotions.

What is not well covered is the ever important question of “why” the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The bombing of Pearl Harbour. Countless atrocities that the Japanese Imperial forces caused in Asia. The rise of blind fascism, imperialism and racism towards its colonies. Essential ignorance of the Potsdam declaration. Leaders’ sacrifice of its own people in kamikaze attacks. Why the Japan’s denno had to be essentially stripped of his power and be left as a figurehead post surrender.

Granted, in comparison to completely whitewashed exhibits of Hiroshima, there is some mention of the history of Japan in WW2 in a small part of display (curiously, in Japanese only), as well as some interactive videos that point to the rise of fascism in Japan. I also noted the videos of Australian POW survivors who did voice out that the atomic bombing would have prevented the Allied invasion of Japan and the millions of casualty that this would have caused. Perhaps any more than this, the museum will face the wrath of the ultra-right nationalists and be entangled in a political cross line.

However, this is still not enough. This was not some natural disaster. Japan was not an innocent bystander and victim, but an active and belligerent participant. We must hope and work towards a future without another nuclear tragedy, not by merely singing peace songs and folding pape cranes but through impartial education and analysis of past actions and mistakes. It is the lack of this component that left me with a bitter taste as I left the museum.","Written December 24, 2018"

Be it the displays of ceramic roof tiles that bubbled and melted in the 3500c blast heat or the human bones that are embedded in a molten glass bottle, the museum does a good job of illustrating that this famous event, one that we have all read about, is really a tragedy that has a huge human element to it, one that you cannot truly appreciate unless you see it with your own eyes.

Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Disappointing,"Museums should be informed by the story of history, not partial history; advancing some great points while ignoring other essential points. This is about the end of a war . . . an ending in horror for the nation Japan. This ending is not presented objectively. I get it that this is Japan so some tilt in the presentation is to be expected. Yet the display says the bombs were dropped to save the lives of American soldiers. This is true. But it is just part of the truth. Other nations’ lives stood to be saved, including, yes, Japanese. So the Japanese lives lost due to the atomic bombs were not in isolation. Had the war continued conventionally, Japan was ready to continue the fight sacrificing many thousands of its own people. How those lives would have added up, one battle at a time, we will never know. But it is not totally unreasonable to imagine that more Japanese lives would have also been lost than those lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As for the allies Americans were not fighting alone. You would not know this from the displays here. This was not a Japan-versus-the-United-States war, it was a World War. Allies active in the Pacific theater also included Philippines, China, United Kingdom, India, Burma, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and others. They all stood to sacrifice lives had the war continued. There is nothing here suggesting why a then-belligerent Japan was fighting in the first place. As this is a Japanese memorial mostly for the Japanese people, not visitors; perhaps they know their own history so thoroughly, the origins of the war go without saying. For similar memorials in the US, I’m confident our own young people are not that informed of this history. If you are interested in how a culture displays its own history, this might be a good visit. Otherwise, you may also be disappointed.","Written October 9, 2018"

Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Good but not great,"What is the purpose of a museum? To explain facts or also to educate and answer ""why?""

I have mixed feelings on this museum, as I had on the similar one in Hiroshima. Both are influenced by the need to show Japanese as Unique Victims.

In terms of explaining what happened on 9th August 1945 and the impact to the people and the city, it does a great job. Many carefully arranged artefacts, with multilingual labels, are on display. And for those that don't skip the later (less visually arresting section) you'll get some background to the War and the role of Japanese militarism in the catastrophe.

But you may also come away with the impression that:

1) the dropping of the Atomic bombs represented some new and catastrophic moral line the Allies crossed. This is dubious, given that 6 months earlier far more Japanese civilians had died in the American firebombing of Tokyo on March 9th-10th). So the right question is why the war had reached the point where democratically elected civilian politicians accepted the need for arguably indiscriminate mass attacks on civilians?

2) the dropping of atomic weapons was avoidable as Japan was about to surrender. Contentious, to say the least.

3) a world without nuclear weapons would be more peaceful. Also contentious - at least for those of us who lived through the Cold War in Europe.

Great museums don't spoon-feed babies. They help us to think about history and how to critically assess competing explanations (whilst indicating where there is a historical consensus). That's why this is a good, but not great, museum.","Written August 25, 2018"
Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Must-see Museum in Nagasaki,"Nagasaki atomic bomb museum is a must-see place whether you like visiting museums or not. It's accessible from the tram line, and it's a few stops north of the main train station. There are signposts to follow from the tram station, and you can probably spend a few hours here.
Firstly, the information provided (in English and Japanese) is extensive, varied and deep. Sources are quoted, and there are a wide variety of displays, from photos to the twisted remains of structures. There are also quite a wide number of viewpoints of the bombing. Korean and western prisoners of war, school children, soldiers, doctors, and those making the big decisions all have a voice. I even found a video about the war in Manchuria, including information about Japanese atrocities there.
Secondly, the exhibitions flow so well to create a story.The displays are clearly designed to be emotive, and it's hard to leave the place without feeling something. I think this is a great example of how to engage an audience, and I can think of some museums around the world that could learn from this.
Finally, a surprising thing for me was that the final exhibition display in the main museum had been updated a mere two days before we visited! The curators here are clearly working hard.
Final word: Is it fun? No of course not, it's about a nuclear bomb being dropped on civilians. It is interesting, emotionally charged, visually stimulating, thought provoking and well worth a visit? Yes.","Written August 22, 2018"

The Atomic Bomb museum was pretty informational and had some old pieces to show of when this thing went off. A Bunch of glass rosaries fused together during the blast along with other items like it.

If you can do without seeing those items and just want to see the hypocenter where the actual bomb went off, then don’t waste time at the museum. The hypocenter site itself has plaques and signs with enough info on them that you don’t really need the museum. Just saying...if you are pressed for time. Buuuut, if you have a little time, go check out some of the artifacts.

The first two pics are some of those artifacts. The pic of the clock of when the bomb went off was the actual time it stopped during the blast and the second is the melted rosaries I mentioned above.",
Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Informative and detailed,We went to both (Hiroshima and Nagasaki) A-bomb museums but found this one more impressive. Many personal stories and information on the aftermath of the bomb. A real size replica of the bomb is present.,
Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,A must-see!,"The museum is full of artifacts from the ruins of the bombing. It explains the effects of the bomb on the people involved and the surroundings, you can even watch multiple different accounts of the bombing from both Japanese and western people who fell victim to the nuclear bomb.
The history and everything revolving the bombing is explained.","Written July 26, 2018"
Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,An emotional trip,"We headed to Nagasaki with plans to visit the museum. A well organised museum with various artifacts, film clips and photos showing the after-math of the terrible incident.

The painful sharing by the locals showed the human touch. Like one of the stories which shared a lady who is terribly burnt yet trying her best to get her child out when the rescuers told her that it is impossible for them to reach out to her kid who was stuck underneath the massive wooden blocks. She didnt say much but use her last breathe to push away the heavy blocks to save her kid before passing away almost immediately.

The lesson learnt from this musuem is so enriching and emotional as it showed the human touch and mother's love.","Written July 25, 2018"
Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,"Fascinating, Informatative and Thought Provoking","I went with my wife and found this museum very thought provoking. It is very different to the museum at Hirosjima. The museum gave a detailed build up to the dropping of the A Bomb, with images of old Nagasaki. There were images of the immediate aftermath and also various exhibits.
The museum is well set out, and deals with the subject in a very subjective way.
I would thoroughly recommend a visit if in Nagasaki.","Written July 24, 2018"
Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,"August 9, 1945: A Museum to reflect on the significance of that day","A well appointed museum with various artifacts, film clips and photos dedicated to the atomic bomb, that was dropped on Nagaskai and the start of the nuclear age. There is a lot to be gained from this museum. The museum is across the street from the street car stop and adjacent to the Peace Memorial.","Written July 17, 2018"
Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,A stop-over for history and non-history lovers,"We headed to Nagasaki with plans to visit the museum. Didn't expect my parents to love this place so much that we spent around three hours inside. It's not a big museum but it does hold a lot of artifacts and information. I appreciated the timeline near the exit of the museum. I guess we liked this this place because it didn't just focus on the bombing but EVERYTHING related to it.

Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Zero historic reference to World War II,"Let me start by mentioning the terrible fate of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, no 'but' on my side. However, the thing that totally offends me is the fact that in the museum there is (to the best of my knowledge) zero reference to the reason why these bombs were dropped. The atrocities of the Japanese in Manchuria, Korea and the rest of southeast Asia are not mentioned. For this reason I consider this museum a missed chance.","Written June 23, 2018"

The atmosphere inside is one of quiet reverent interest and respect. Many of the exhibits have a very moving impact on the viewer. There is also a “cut-away” full sized example of the type of nuclear bomb that the Americans dropped.

Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Thought provoking museum,This museum shows the horrors of what a nuclear bomb and war can do to mankind. Man's inhumanity to man is so well shown here.

For the gas bags complaining about schoolchildren in the way-well perhaps you weren't so fortunate to be taken on field trips as a child but despite their laughter and noise I am sure they absorbed good information. Next time do what I did and go on Sunday-no school groups but yes some families-mostly Japanese. The balanced presentation about the causes of the war is particularly impressive.

There is also the ground zero of the bomb in the park outside where monuments of the events are erected.",
Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Very confusing place with limited facilties,"There were so many Japanese school parties here and the children clearly did not understand the significance of the place. It felt totally surreal to be so distraught and moved while surrounded by a sea of laughter and exuberance. I shall never forget the experience.
The cafe is pretty useless. Serves only the basics and in a country where waiters and waitresses are unfailingly helpful, the staff were all surly and miserable.
Finding your way into the museum is quite tricky. It seems to have so many entrances, yet once inside it is not very clear where to go. But maybe a lot better without a million kids around?","Written June 1, 2018"

A Perfect place for kids to learn about their history and the terrible tragedy of nuclear warfare. There are displays not only of artifacts but those that show a model of the ""fat boy"" bomb and how it was made and how such a bomb is detonated. This is a museum not to be missed for its insight into this terrible day and the human tragedy that occurred.

Evidence of the UV effects and the melting effects of the bomb are on display and the eerie coincidence that all the clocks stopped at 11:02.",

The museum displays and commentary are fascinating and sobering. From facts about the compression waves of the bomb to the side effects on people to the debates by scientists about the use of atomic weapons, it’s a lot to take in without losing one’s appetite. And to think that this bomb was created more than 70 years ago. It also shows how, when the super powers and other nations start throwing their weight round by boasting about their nuclear arsenals, it’s time to get very very worried.

The plane circled a few times and couldn't see anything, then through the clouds they spotted Nagasaki and decided to drop the bomb there. So basically those people were very unlucky.

Although this museum does not have as many historical photos and graphic displays as Hiroshima, it provides a truer history of the Japanese involvement in WWII. I was very disturbed by the Hiroshima museum's historical writeup about how Japan went into China to ""help"" the Chinese as it's an attempt to hide the historical fact that it was an invasion and attempt to take over China. At least in the Nagasaki museum, there were at least a couple of displays using the terms ""invasion"" in describing the Japanese presence in China during WWII. The museum also provided an inside look at what the U.S. was planning and why Nagasaki was bombed as an atomic target.

No reference is made to the terrors imposed by the Japanese Imperial Army in places such as Manchuria, Singapore or Burma where civilians and POWs were killed without mercy or starved to death. Perhaps a reference to the Burma railway and the horrors imposed by the Japanese might help understand why a wonder weapon would end their ability to impose more death and destruction.
The reference in text claiming that as millions of dollars had been spent on developing the bomb, it had to be used, is offensive. President Truman took an appallingly difficult decision and the correct one. I am not from the USA.","Written March 22, 2018"

Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Nagasaki on 9th August 1945,"The museum is incredibly informative and educational. Pictures show all the devastation made by an atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki on the day of 9th August 1945. Nuclear fission was created by the explosives imploding on the core of ‘plutonium’.

Facts of the atomic bomb: Length 3.25m, diameter 1.52m, weight 4.5tons. Explosive force: Equal to 21-ktons of TNT. Nick name: Fat Man (because of the look of its shape).

According to the information, it was targetted at Kokura- an industrial area in the northern coast of Kyushu initially, but due to clouds and poor visibility, the US Bomber B29 that loaded with Fat Man then changed its course to the next target- Nagasaki, when they sighted Mitsubishi Nagasaki Arm Factory.

Plutonium: the chemical element that used as a fuel in the nuclear reactors, and as an explosive in nuclear fission weapons.","Written January 11, 2018"
Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Interesting comprehensive museum,"This museum is next to the site where the bomb hit in Nagasaki. It has various exhibits telling stories of victims and survivors. At the entrance is a series of paper cranes. The legend is that anyone who folds 1000 paper cranes gets their wish granted. A 12 year old girl exposed to radiation from the bomb at age 2 folded cranes in hopes of her wish of surviving would be granted, but died before she could complete them. The museum is not huge, but it is modern, interesting and comprehensive.","Written January 10, 2018"

Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Haunting.,"Most visit Nagasaki to understand the effects of the atomic bomb, and the museum does an excellent job of conveying them in the most solemn of ways.

The whole place was simple, making all the items on display, primarily artifacts from the war period, much more impactful. English captions were available for all exhibits and were well-written. Definitely a must do when in Nagasaki, and perhaps half a day, just to take in the full scope of the tragedy, would be good at the museum.","Written December 25, 2017"

Japan,Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum,Well worth the trip,"Although I’ve lived in Japan for several years in the past (more than six years), I never had a chance to go to Nagasaki to see the museum, although I’ve been to Hiroshima several times. On a recent onsen trip to the Eastern part of Nagasaki Prefecture, my wife and I first spent a few days in Nagasaki City. It was then that I finally had an opportunity to visit the Peace Museum. It is, without a doubt, a sobering and emotional place that will take you through the days, months, and years following the dropping of the bomb. The facility is filled with interesting artifacts that will have you wondering how any humans could have survived such an ordeal. Indeed, some of the chronicled stories of those that did somehow survive will bring tears to your eyes. When you see and hear their stories you will then believe that often said statement that ‘the lucky ones died that day’. There are a multitude of reasons which supposedly support the dropping of both bombs. However, when you see the devastation, and the impacts that the bombs had even decades later…you cannot help but question the decision, and religious or not, you may very well find yourself praying that this never happens again.

There is one section which focuses on the years leading up to the dropping of the bombs. It highlights Japan’s actions (aggressions), in the Asian region. There is a tremendous amount of misinformation given, or more accurately, an abundance of historical facts which are left out (as is also the case at the Hiroshima museum), or tremendously downplayed. If you are a war history buff you will indeed notice it, especially if you can read and understand Japanese. Although not as grossly inaccurate as Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, it nonetheless speaks to Japan’s legendary ‘denial’ issues. But that is a socio-political discussion better left for another day,

As a first time visitor to The Museum, I thought it was a well thought-out and designed facility with ample space to see all of the displays without crowding. We spent, literally, an entire afternoon there, but my wife (who is Japanese), and I (a native New Yorker)spent much time discussing historical points as we viewed the exhibits. I do think it is somewhat smaller than Hiroshima’s museum. The associated Halls, event spaces, and archival library, however are all very nice. Really well done in a way which encourages contemplation and peace of mind. I think that Nagasaki is typically something of an afterthought for most foreigners traveling to Japan. When friends or coworkers here in NYC talk to me about their potential destinations in Japan, Nagasaki is hardly ever mentioned. Of the two ‘atomic cities’ Hiroshima gets the overwhelming majority of the attention. I think this is primarily due to the perception that Nagasaki is more difficult to get to or out of the way, which is not at all the case. It is readily accessible by multiple rail routes, and is a wonderful little city that is very easy to navigate. The museum is up a very steep road however, which can be challenging to anyone with mobility issues. If so, a taxi may be in order.

In closing, in my opinion, if one is visiting Japan they should try hard to visit either Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Just as Japanese people visiting Hawaii should see the Pearl Harbor Historical Sites. Given a choice between the Hiroshima and Nagasaki museums, I actually prefer Nagasaki, as it is much less crowded. But, I can understand someone heading to Hiroshima to see the Dome in addition to its Museum. The artifacts are largely the same at both locations; clothing worn by people at the time of the blast; metal, stone, and other items melted by the intense heat; household items which somehow survived, etc.. The individual stories at each location however, are quite different and riveting. Visiting Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum was a sobering experience to be sure, and a stark reminder of how close the world currently is to repeating such a horrific act. It is something you really need to see. I’m so glad I went.

In the case of Nagasaki I was less impressed. The museum of course is about a very similar event and tries to tell the same story as Hiroshima but somehow fails to bring the message home. Maybe because it misses the very compelling story of the girl that contracts leukemia and tries to survive folding 1000 paper cranes. That story really drives the message home and I missed it in Nagasaki.

It holistically tells the story of the events and days / months before and after the drop of the A-bomb and how generations of Japanese (and others) were traumtized by this terrible event. One can hardly not be shaken by this exposition and not feel a sense of solidarity with and sorrow for the people of Hiroshima.

Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,A unique emotional experience,"Visiting the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum triggered lots of emotions and questions. It helps all the visitors to make a decision whether they would become a peacemaker or not and to reflect upon wars, arms, weapons and especially nuclear ones. It is essential to remember that war is not limited by space and that it can affect all the lives of various populations in many parts of the world. It also made us realize that the conservation of artifacts and historical items is important if you want to make history believable. Seeing the old clothes and glasses, fragments of buildings and other infrastructures and linking them to the written texts was a very complex process and helped us to become witnesses of the horror the Japanese people living in Hiroshima. The bad effects of the war on children were clearly demonstrated through the exhibition and this provoked an immense sadness. The view of thousands of paper cranes near the Sadako Sasaki statue would allow hope for a peaceful world.

If you’re into these museums, which we are, plan for around 3 hours if you want to view everything including listening to the videos with a very leisurely stroll. Be prepared to leave a little emotional after hearing the stories and seeing the items.

Once you step down from the shinkansen at the train station, you’ll find a city full of vibrations and lovely. What remains of the A-bomb blast is contained in the ground zero in the Memorial Park area. And stepping into the Museum is just like you were brought back to 1945 seeing the pictures, witnesses in videos and belongings of the victims of the bomb.

Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,The museum of anecdotal stories,"Prior to visiting; I was mistakenly under the illusion that this museum would detail Japan's involvement in WW2 culminating in an atomic bomb being dropped on the site of the museum.

It is not this. Please do not expect more than a momentary museum placard detailing any events (including WW2 or Japanese operations in China) leading to the dropping of the weapon.

However, it's not quite a ""peace museum"" either. More so a grizly monument to women and children that lost their lives in both the impact and related radiation events immediately thereafter.

By way of museum quality, this is okay. The first two rooms are world class. Then it deteriorates rapidly to anecdotal stories and children's items of clothing.

Unfortunately, some of the history is.. revisionist at best (at worst - knowingly omitting information)- but it is more smartly done than the overt examples in the Hanoi Hilton museum, Vietnam. I can best detail this obscurance when we left the exhibition.

Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,"Highly selective ""history""","I spent half a day with a Japanese government-licensed guide touring this museum.
I'm sorry to say that she presented a dishonest, completely one-sided diatribe on the events that led up to the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima.

Astonishingly, she said the US was responsible for starting the Pacific War because Japan was ""forced"" to attack Pearl Harbor after the US embargoed the export of scrap metal to Japan in 1941. No mention of why the embargo was instituted--which was the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. (Text inside the museum correctly states that Japan started the war.) She (and the museum) naturally focused on the 146,000 casualties in Hiroshima, and there are hundreds of pictures of people with horrific injuries. But neither she nor the museum made any mention of 300,000 Chinese that the Imperial Japanese Army slaughtered in Nanjing alone.

Throughout her presentation my guide all but accused the US of committing a war crime here. She said an unspecified crew member of the ""Enola Gay,"" the B-29 that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, had visited the city a few years earlier. When asked if he regretted killing innocent civilians, she quoted him as saying ""there are no innocents in war."" She said she thought he should have been killed for saying so. ""Innocent victims"" is the overall theme of the museum, but there is no mention of the fact that there was a major Japanese Army base in the city.

I lived in Japan as a child from 1950 to 1953. I've been back several times, and have always been treated with great courtesy and friendliness. I was frankly shocked to have virulent anti-American propaganda thrown in my face, and quite distressed to see other people in my tour group eating it up because they were clearly ignorant of the truth. The Japanese government historically has had great difficulty coming to terms with its behavior in WWII. This museum was filled with school children, which makes me wonder what they're being taught in school and what they take away from their field trips to places like this.",

There is an area which is really graphic and quite harrowing, the individual stories, pictures, personal artefacts and clothing are very moving and emotional.

You also learn a lot about the rise of atomic and nuclear weapons, some of the history surrounding the bombing and the efforts to remove these weapons from the world.

There are many exhibits and the museum can be quite crowded, there are English translations for all the commentary and audio books available as well, there are a lot of school trips and young children around clearly doing projects.

The area outside the museum is very peaceful, the school trips conduct their own individual ceremonies at some of the statues and leave behind colourful paper cranes, as a symbol for
Global peace.....",

Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Disappointed,"After looking at the highly rated reviews on Tripadvisor I expected much more from this museum.
For a start it was very crowded and difficult to read articles relating to the exhibits (there is an awful lot of reading in this museum) and secondly, to me, there was no mention of the main reason for dropping the bomb - to bring the Second World War to an end and save the lives of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, who would have died if it had continued. It seemed to lay the blame for the exploding the bomb solely on the United States with the Japanese people portarayed as innocent bystanders. Perhaps there should be another museum alongside which remembers the horrors of the Burma Railway (200,000 died in horrific circumstances) or the Nanking Massacre (250,000 murdered). Perhaps there would then be a more balanced view of why the bomb was dropped and the further atrocities it stopped.
Whether or not the second bomb should have been dropped on Nagasaki is an entirely different question and much harder to justify.","Written November 7, 2019"
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Sad? Yes. Haunting? Yes. Worth it?

These children were seven or eight years old. I am not quite sure why a group this young should be exposed to this. And they seemed totally disinterested. But for teenagers and adults of every culture, this museum is a reminder of what should never be again.
Please be warned that this material is incredibly graphic. I have been to many Holocaust museums, and this is one on steroids. That being said, this is very modern and Well laid-out museum is top-notch and getting the message across. Hundreds and hundreds of photographs and artifacts.

I strongly recommend to think the visit through if you aren't dealing with this kind of stuff well or if you are bringing someone sensitive along.

Bringing children is a big no in my personal oppinion. If someone took me here when I was 13 I would been incredibly shaken and have nightmares for years. I am 20 nowadays and going to see the museum was my own decision. It's incredibly emotional and strong but also really graphic.

Even though I believe the museum deserves 5 stars, I would still recommend giving it a pass if you are sensitive about stuff like this. It's not worth the emotional hit.","Written November 4, 2019"

The museum contains photos of the devastation caused by the atomic bomb along with photos of the victims that perished and survived, including brief descriptions of their lives. In addition to photos, there are artifacts that were impacted by the bomb such as portions of staircases, bicycles, clothing, bottles, helmets, and wallets to name a few. I visited on a weekday afternoon and the museum was very busy and due to the amount of visitors, there were lines behind many of the exhibits and some were difficult to view due to the amount of people. There were also rooms that were filled with people and movement was at a standstill, so it may be best to visit at non-peak times. Overall, it was a great day here.",

The museum displays all kinds of artifacts and clothing and tells stories about the families and people connected to them. It sure makes it very human, very real, and it really impresses on you the aftermath with the radiation, and the horrible illnesses that people came down with afterward and died.

The museum was very very crowded, there were groups of all ages from all over the world. We heard tour guides speaking many different languages, leading somber groups from exhibit to exhibit.
We began by walking through vibrant Hiroshima in 1945. On the floor in front of us we saw the dropping of the Atomic Bomb and then the devastating aftermath. This interactive video lasted about 2 minutes, I videotaped this, it's a shame I can't upload video's here. We moved from room to room, through the devastation of the city, seeing photographs of destruction, pieces of twisted metal and stone left behind. The steps with the shadow where a person was sitting was memorable. There were lot's of photographs of people with deformities and physical damage from radiation poisoning. We saw the lasting physical, emotional and social effects of a society traumatized by the atomic bomb.
A gallery presented the dangers of nuclear weapons. the design and construction of the Park and Museum, and a commitment to peace.

If you are aware of the picture story called Sadako by Eleanor Coerr, and/or another picture story called My Hiroshima by Junko Morimoto, then this place is a must to visit.

Easy to reach from Hiroshima Station. There are two options by public transport: tram or bus, by using your Suica, Pasmo or ICOCA cards (use the North exit from Hiroshima Station). The third option is the hop on/off bus is covered by JR Railpass (use the South exit from Hiroshima Station).

Entrance is only ¥200 for adults. My suggestion is to also hire the audio guide for a further ¥400.

There are 54 listening posts on the audio guide. Visitors are extremely quiet in the museum, you can almost hear a pin drop. Every now and then, there are a couple of sniffles and a few quiet tears shed, as you listen and read people’s experiences.

What we all should be concerned about is not ""gun violence"", ""LGBT rights"", social justice, or elections. We need to be concerned and preoccupied with what God intended for us, and what we should become in His eyes. We need to be preoccupied how to love each other better.",

Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,An incredibly powerful experience.,"Hiroshima, Japan.

Monday 6th August 1945. It is 8.15am. The residents of Hiroshima are preparing for a new day. 31,000 feet above them Colonel Paul Tibbets of the U.S. army is flying a Boeing bomber aircraft. It is called the Enola Gay and is named after his mother. A moment later he releases an atomic bomb. It is known as ""Little Boy"". It takes precisely 44.4 seconds from the time it is released to hit the city of Hiroshima. In one single act by a single man 70,000–80,000 people are killed by the blast and the subsequent firestorm. Another estimated 70,000 people will die over the following months. To my mind, it was the most cruel single act of retribution perpetrated on mankind.

Nothing can prepare you for the horror and pain suffered by the Japanese people on that day and over the following months and years. Yesterday, when I went to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, I certainly wasn't.

When I entered the permanent exhibition space my emotions started to rise as I took in the images laid out before me. I had started to take some photographs but I stopped because it felt so wrong. Like I was invading a space in which I had no right to be. The horrific pictures of human suffering are indescribable. There aren't any words at all. The shocking images send you into a kind of numb grief. For people you never knew. In a place you've never been. It is simply heartbreaking. All the more so because this terrible suffering was caused by mankind.

I came out of there with tears running down my cheeks. I wasn't the only one. Even now, while writing this I find the same thing happening. It has really stayed with me. And so it should.

You won't find any of the images I have described above on this post. However, I have included a small group of photographs taken in the Museum which show some of the devastation. The photographers, many of whom risked there lives, captured some of the key moments after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. It is through their bravery and their photographs that mean we and future generations will never be allowed to forget.

Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Fascinating but crowded,"A fascinating museum that tells the stories of the people of Hiroshima during the atomic blast. Very cheap and all the displays include an English translation beside them.

The first half of the museum is sombre and includes lots of items (including the belongings of children) caught up in the blast to tell the story of the day and the aftermath. Very quiet so probably not suitable for small children.

The second half told the story of the development and use of the nuclear bomb and about nuclear proliferation. I understand that the museum is dedicated to the abolition of nuclear weapons but this section didn’t feel completely objective. I suspect that historians would question some of the information, which doesn’t quite tell the whole picture and suits the museum’s agenda. Still fascinating to see though if you keep that caveat in mind.

I worked in the Nuclear Power industry when I was working and I realize that a lot of the knowledge that we have on radiation exposure came from the data on the Japanese bombings.

I used the HOHO bus that is included in the JR pass to get to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. It is 200 yen to get into the museum. This museum is a must see.

The museum carefully documents what happened to the civilian people before, during and after the bombing occurred. I spent about 3.5 hours going through the museum and afterwards I felt ill because of what happened. Since these were the first nuclear bombs that were dropped, no one knew what the effects of so much radiation would do to the people exposed to it. Many people thought that they would be OK when they survived the initial effects of bombing only to die from the long term effects of the radiation.

The devastation of the landscape was total. The majority of the original buildings (except for the Atomic Bomb Dome) were wooden and they were totally destroyed. There was nothing left after the bombing. This has allowed Hiroshima to be completely rebuilt and the city is now beautiful. However, we must not forget the affects of the nuclear bomb.

The children, five and eight year old, were wide-eyed throughout the exhibition. I was concerned that it might frighten the children but it did not however it brought a torrent of questions about the incident. Caveat - discernment is needed whether children can cope with the photos.

I was personally surprised at the amount of tears we saw among the visitors.

This exhibit is done very well. It personalizes the event, we feel empathy for the victims. The exhibition is in Japanese and English. There is an audio tour guide available for a fee,

Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Great museum - would change a few things if I went again,"The Peace Memorial Museum is definitely a must-see in Japan, and much can be learnt from the displays. It's a humbling place which captures the horror of nuclear warfare and also details the sequence of events leading to deployment from the Allies.

That said, if I had to go again, I would give the following advice to myself.
1. Don't take the audio guide. It's not very expensive, but I felt that it didn't add much. The narrators voice reads the first few lines from the display, and sometimes adds a bit more detail, but hardly much to engage on. If you're a quick reader you're better off skipping this to engage with the text and visuals more, without the distracting audio
2. Don't go to the survivor's memorial lecture. I'm not sure what the exact name is, but it's an English presentation of about 45min in which a lady whose mother and schoolteacher survived the A-bomb detail their stories. I felt like I would rather have spent the time going slower through the museum then listening to the stories
3. If you can (museum personnel might be a bit directive and force you to go the other way) I would start with the history leading up to the deployment, and then go to through the after effects area. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of these sections, but I do know that the normal flow of the museum is against this recommendation. I suppose it's all a matter of personal opinion.","Written July 4, 2019"

The projected depiction of the dropping of the bomb is especially excellent, and appears to move.

Out the window you can look across the Memorial Park to the Atomic Bomb Dome.

You should visit the Dome building, the memorial park and museum together; all are within walking distance of each other, and all can be reached on the hop-on, hop-off buses.","Written July 3, 2019"
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,A must visit to make sure we never forget....,"There is so much more to this site than the Peace Dome, which is very moving in its own right. Make sure to take time to walk the grounds and to see the Peace Mound, where all the unidentifiable cremated bodies were buried, the Peace Bell, and the Children's Memorial. The underground memorial with photos of the destruction from October 1945 on the walls is a perfect time for reflection.
Collectively, a very sobering experience that should be seen by all if we are ever going to give peace a chance.

Easy to take the Shinkansen from Kyoto as a self-guided day trip to witness this
historical site.","Written July 3, 2019"
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Moving experience without blame,"Truly moving experience explaining, in a high-tech, innovative way, what happened during the bombing and the aftermath.

While it does talk about how the Americans planned the bombing, it very obviously avoids any explanation or information as to why Japan was bomb (so for the uninformed, it would seem like Japan was randomly bombed and to that I would say do some unbiased historical research from the American and Chinese point of view during WWII).

Nonetheless, it’s a well done tribute to the sadness of war and, unlike the Vietnam War Museum in Saigon (which placed pure blame angrily on Americans), the Japanese gave a more somewhat more neutral presentation of what happened, certainly less angry, and concludes with wishes for this never to be repeated.

This is not to be missed.","Written July 2, 2019"
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,A Remarkable Place,"We have visited many museums in our travels over the years but I have to say that this is the best, and most moving place I have ever visited. I was born just after the events of Hiroshima and it is so hard to believe that this could happen. The attitude and belief of the people today is to be admired. No apparent animosity just the hope and prayers that nothing like this will happen again. We visited the museum during Golden Week and with the great numbers of people did not get the chance to spend as much time as I would have liked to looking at the exhibits, photos etc. I would love to go back one day to take more in.","Written July 2, 2019"

Hiroshima has been in my thoughts for many years and I new I would visit when I got here and I am so very glad I did. Its amazing city when you consider it was virtually Destroyed by THAT BOMB.
The Museum will make you sad its HEARTBREAKING to understand what happened here But its Very important to come here and feel it. Schools come
here I saw many groups visiting. There has been a Great deal of care to build these Museums and the Japanese people are very caring so I will be visiting again next year 2020",
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Simply Superb,"This is an incredibly moving experience. It's not often a Museum will shock you or move you as much as this one. Its fascinating too as it documents Hiroshima before, during and after the Atomic Bomb detonation.
Some very arresting displays of photos of victims and their burns, the dead, the fused bottles and incinerated lunchboxes, a tricycle, charred clothing and a myriad of charred or melted possessions.
There's a model of the Atom Bomb dropped here and the one dropped on Nagasaki, a bronze cast of the Atomic Bomb Dome before and after and just huge dreds of fascinating and heartbreaking stories from victims. The display on the little girl behind the Children's Monument is heartbreaking.
Get the audioguide, it's brilliant. I spent hours in here, just an absorbing, horrifying, interesting and moving experience.
An absolute must do. One of the best museums I've ever been to.",
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Conflicted,"The museum was absolutely beautiful and very well designed- I wish we had similar ones in Australia. However, the story was told from the Japanese perspective and this can be difficult to understand if you had family or friends who fought. Would highly recommend, but suggest keeping this caveat in mind.",
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Thought provoking,"This is the major attraction in Hiroshima and probably why you are here or going so it goes without saying it's a must see. Very thought provoking but be aware also very confronting which is the point. The focus on the local children will leave an impression.

I think no matter when you go it's going to be busy with either tour groups or school groups. If you just go with the crowd and take your time you'll get to still appreciate the care and thought put into the museum.","Written June 28, 2019"
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,"Excellent museum, with an important message","The horror and heartbreaking real life stories of victims and survivors of the A-bomb are sensitivity told through exhibits and artefacts.

A visit to this museum is sobering, but essential for anyone visiting the city.","Written June 27, 2019"

Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Moving and emotional,"If you are traveling w/ children 10 years old or younger, you should prepare them for the exhibits. There were a lot of school children ~ ages 10-12 on field trip. We saw a few students crying and their teacher had to escort them out of the exhibit. A worthwhile education thoroughly covering the history of the atomic bombing. Allow at least a 2-3 hours visit. They close at 5pm.

The beginning of the museum starts with an aerial projected map of Hiroshima city and provides an insight into the devastation and extent of damage on that fateful day, and is a perfect lead into the rest of the museum.

The surrounding memorial park with the Atomic Bomb Dome and Children’s Peace Monument is also thought-provoking and a good place to reflect on the horrors of war and the everlasting hope for peace.",
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Powerful,"Some of the exhibits can be quite upsetting including clothing & personal effects worn by the victims.

We had a private talk with a Hiroshima survivor who told us her sad story. She was 8 years old & was only 3km from the hypocentre & she very open discussing that day & her life up to the present.

We did get to hear from both sides of the story having visited Pearl Harbour a few years ago.

Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,So much history,Such a nice place to visit and see the history. such a nice park area. great place to spend an hour or so walking around,
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,A brilliant illustration of the horrors experienced by Hiroshima victims,"An incredible collection of artifacts from the atomic bomb attack
on Hiroshima in 1945. Bottles, ceramics and metal items fused
together by the intense heat. The stone step from the Sumitomo
Bank, with the shadow of a customer, waiting for the bank to open,
all that remained of him as he was vapourised in the explosion. The
tiny child's tricycle, whose owner did not survive.

There are many stories told of those who lived beyond the bombing
only to die during the following 15 years of cancer caused by the
radiation.

The collection of recovered items is a vivid testimony to the horrors
experienced by the residents of Hiroshima. The before and after
photographs show the sheer devastation caused.

Hiroshima has adopted a very positive attitude and the emphasis is
not on the rights or wrongs of the past, but to promote peace.

Let us hope that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the first and last to
experience such extreme suffering.

Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Powerful,"The museum houses a stunning collection of artifacts associated with the bombing of Hiroshima, and the devastating aftermath. Parts of it may be difficult to go through because the museum doesn't shy away from showing how the blast directly affected the human body. And if you are an American, please don't be ""that guy"" loudly arguing to your companions that ""it had to be done in the interest of the greater good"". I found it extremely distasteful to bring that up while surrounded by evidence of so much suffering, pain, and death. Don't be that Ugly American stereotype!","Written June 15, 2019"

The photos are chilling and very emotive, but when you read the stories it really hits you. Some people were actually sobbing. It's a slow queued walk through the museum. Also interesting was the details of how the bomb worked and some of the letters written about how the sites were selected. We spent about 2+ hours here. It's worth seeing the remains of the 'dome' building before the museum to appreciate the how the bomb annihilated the area.","Written June 15, 2019"
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Very touching and informative,"The purpose of the museum was to raise awareness of the devastation caused by the atomic bomb dropped on the city. It was very impactful and you left feeling sad for the victims and fearful that this can occur in the future.

It hopes that such awareness will hopefully make people supportive of efforts for nuclear disarmament and everlasting peace. It certainly accomplished its objective with me.","Written June 13, 2019"

Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,"Brilliant, but slightly ruined","I’m going to echo the sentiments precisely of the previous review on TA. The exhibition itself is superb; thought provoking, moving, educational. But the museum needs to address its entrance policy. Literally over a thousand school kids were let in at the same time. It was, at times, literally impossible to move. The museum really needs to allow such groups on a time slot basis. We waited for them to all move through the museum (which they did at quick speed without really looking at anything) before we resumed our visit. Such a shame as it’s otherwise brilliant.

I shall never forget her passion for peace in the world. This is full on and I really think worth a visit.",
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,All politicians should see this,"We were near the end of an 8-day bus tour of Japan. An optional tour on the bullet train to Hiroshima was available. To see the miraculous recovery of a destroyed city and landscape, was well worth it, but the Peace Memorial Museum is something I think everyone on earth should visit, especially the politicians who hold the fate of the world in their hands. We shared the day with many school groups, who were visibly touched by what they saw, as were we. The displays were sensitively done, though nothing was left out or glossed over. Many visitors were in tears. This was the last thing on our agenda for the day, having spent a few hours already, walking around the large area devoted to memorials and landmarks. Something I never imagined that I would do, was to walk where the bomb had exploded. Nowadays, there is no more radiation in Hiroshima than there is in any other part of the world.","Written May 31, 2019"
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Must see!,"I think it's one of these places everyone should visit at least once in their life. We all learn about Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the horror of the atomic bombings at school, but here, with all of these photographs, stories and survivors artwork* it takes that knowledge to a completely new level. At some point it gets more personal, you can actually feel how horrifying it was. I spent over 3 hours in the museum and was so affected that I couldn't stop thinking about it for the next few days.

Apart from the contents, the interesting thing about this museum is that the entry fee is ridiculously small (200 yens). Thanks to that even more people are able to see it. I really appreciate that policy.

Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Smaller than expected but very informative,"The museum was very well made and the fee was very reasonable. We liked the exhibitions, especially the first one explaining about the US atomic bomb programs and testing prior to the bombing of Hiroshima. They also have exhibits about people’s injuries and the effects from radiation.
The one thing that was missing for us was explanation about the clean-up efforts and how long it took to rebuild afterwards.",

My heart went to the innocent folks who perished especially the many innocent school children. Any kind of War should never have happened, revenge & retaliation belong to the evil ones! This Museum is with good info for us to visualise what happened on 6 Aug 1945! Peace to the World, everyone can do a part!",
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Key destination in Hiroshima,"A detailed explanation of what happened when and after the bomb was dropped. It’s at times harrowing but if you’re in Hiroshima this is a must-see. The animation showing before and after is particularly shocking. If you take kids be aware that they may find some images scaring.
Why not 5 stars? The museum does not explain the context of the war and focuses only on the victims of the bomb. I felt that they should have included information to explain why the Allies felt it necessary to use this awful weapon.","Written May 30, 2019"
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Must see,"The museum does a very good job sharing what happened on the day of the bombing and the time afterward. As one can expect, there was very little about the Japanese aggression that ultimately led to the bombing. I was somewhat troubled by the storyline that the bombing occurred in part to justify the bomb's $2 B development cost and the need to give private sector developers a return on their investment. Also, the so-called 'guest workers' from Korea and China who also died was troubling too as they were essentially captive prisoners forced to work in the factories. All that said, it is worth visiting this museum but it is also important to be informed about the perspectives of others too.","Written May 29, 2019"

The before and after of a roof tile and blasted bottle made an impression on me.
There were also real stories of survivers, from that day.

Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,"Not to be a victim, but to be a fighter.","This Museum was originally considered as the main part of the Peace Park. The architect of the Museum and the Park as a whole Kenzo Tange made the Museum deliberately simple to strengthen the impact of the exhibition. Despite the fact that I came prepared, the exposition is still amazing. This is an emotionally difficult visit. The day before, we were in a similar Museum in Nagasaki. The authors of the exposition faced a difficult task: to condemn the atomic bombing, but not to fall into the justification of Japanese militarism. Excessive political correctness... The atrocities of the Japanese military in the Dutch West Indies and Burma, or the massacre of Nanjing in 1937, don`t justify the use of atomic bombs against Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The American command didn`t bomb these cities specifically to achieve a ""clean effect."" Yes, the headquarters of the 2nd Japanese army was in Hiroshima and was one of the goals of the bombing. But only ""one of."" By the way, the commander of the 2nd army Shunroku Hata was alive, and even appeared in the dock at the Tokyo international Tribunal. Such is the effectiveness of the bombing of the areas... But the main goal - terror against civilians was achieved. 145,000 Hiroshima residents died immediately or died in terrible agony from radiation and radioactive contamination until the end of 1945. Another 50 thousand hibakusha died after... The creators of the Museum showed the main purpose of the bombing is very simple. Sculpture - a gift of English Coventry is in the Museum. This city bombed by the Nazis on November 14, 1940, became a symbol of barbarism and terror, along with the Spanish Guernica. And courage and fortitude of citizens. That's probably the main thing. Not to be a victim, but to be a fighter. I missed this at the Museum. How to return to the ashes, how to restore the city in just 10 years, how to get up from his knees. After all, you can only fight for peace on straight legs.",
Japan,Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum,Heartbreaking look into victims experiences.. everyone should see this.,"I found Hiroshima to be a beautiful city! But as we entered the peace park to head to the memorial, as beautiful as it is, it feels heavy.. the whole area still has a sadness about it that is palpable. On entering the museum you are immersed straight away by walking into a circular room with floor to ceiling images of the destroyed city right round you, it is a hard hitting start. From then you see testimonials and the haunting art made by survivors. The burned/melted objects and clothes. The children’s possessions. I found it heartbreaking and was moved to tears very early on, I found it a difficult experience but one I think everyone should have. Many reviewers say this museum plays the ‘victim card’ and is propaganda.. Yes there is very little mentioned about the Japanese military actions before this atrocity, and yes it does make Japan appear an innocent nation minding its business when suddenly attacked without warning.. BUT!! THIS. STILL. HAPPENED. To civilians, women, children. Horrific hideous things that lasted for many years. Look at it as a museum about the effects of the a-bomb on the people.. and pray to whatever god you believe in that it wont happen to you!","Written May 25, 2019"

The museum tells the stories of the victims and their families in graphic detail. Some of the exhibits and photos may not be the best for small children.

It is a very solemn experience. People look at and take in the exhibits without saying a word. Only museum I have been in where everyone is silent and looks in shock. Very powerful indeed.

Once you get done with the main hall, you are greeted to a nice view of Peace Park.

This is a do not miss if you are in Hiroshima. If you are in Kyoto or Osaka, it can be done easily as a day trip if you take the bullet train. The museum is a 1500 yen cab ride from the train station. Very easy.

Japan,Atomic Bomb Dome,Stark Reminder of Atomic Blast,"This well-maintained shell of the former 1914 Industrial Promotion Hall clearly shows the effects of the nearby Aug. 6, 1945, atomic blast. It is one of only a few structures not totally demolished in the immediate 1.9-mile area. The building remains my most vivid recollection of the monuments and memorials I saw when visiting Hiroshima's Peace Park in October 2019.

Japan,Atomic Bomb Dome,A message of Peace,The atomic bomb dome is well preserved and a lot of information regarding the history of the actual atomic bomb (nothing about the history of WWII). It leaves visitors the clear message of the importance of peace and the devastation of war. It is an educational place. Requires time to absorb the history which should shape our minds. A must do while in Hiroshima.,
Japan,Atomic Bomb Dome,Ideal memorial to the bombing!,"Prior to visiting, and reading the informative signboards, I was not really aware of the division of public opinion that existed post-WWII, between those who favoured preservation of the remains as a memorial to the bombing and those who favoured the complete demolition of a dangerously dilapidated structure which evoked painful memories. Half a century on from the decision to preserve the remains (in 1967), it seems to have been the correct one as the Atomic Bomb Dome is today the iconic reminder of the devastation that befell Hiroshima that morning in August 1945.
Given the number of visitors to Hiroshima and the Dome's position as one of the top attractions, I particularly liked the way the preservation had been handled and also the way the ""mass tourism"" had been successfully managed. Several times I circled the building photographing the details which appealed to me from a discreet distance behind the fencing, without encroaching on others taking selfies or indeed others interfering with my own quiet enjoyment of the moment.
For me, quite ideal!",

Japan,Atomic Bomb Dome,O! That I were deaf!,"I came specifically for art purposes. To try and get in touch with the Elan... the Spirit... of the place. Do not forget, this Dome is less than 800 metres from the hypocentre of the first A bomb (in recorded history) to be deliberately exploded over human beings (that most of these human beings were civilian is important to 'absorb' in your viewing as well. I must digress a moment - but still staying firmly within the travel 'experience' - and tell you I am an Australian, 73 years old, and only in these weeks gone by, have fully understood how ordinary people, who do not want war, can be dragged into one by the driving force of political malfunction. Political malfunction they can do nothing about. Democratic voting, you ask? Nope. In Australia, the 2019/2020 season has delivered ordinary citizens a leadership that can align itself with Fascis regimes at the drop of a hat, and carry Australia into war... war of benefit to the Oligarchs of this world... As I say, this is not digressing from the travel experience, but to hammer home the bomb's use on civilian folk who were basically just like you. They had Mom n Dads, were Moms and Dads; had Loves and Lovers; had Sisters and Brothers, Aunts and Uncles, Siblins and Children; Friends and Acquaintances; Workmates and Colleagues... on and on... And they had Plans... Just like me... Just like you... That the wrong side of your own political leadership can snuff-out without you being able to do a thing...) So: to the Moment... The Dome... I was there for art, with easel set-up and sketching away, and folk would sometimes wander over and chat, and The best way to capture the essence of both the conversations and the Elan of the place is the Haiku (the seventeen syllable Japanese poem arranged in five/seven/five pattern), I ended-up creating on my sketch: ""Passers-by ask me:/ ""Can you hear the Ghosts from there?""/ O! That I were deaf...""",
Japan,Atomic Bomb Dome,Must SEE when visiting Hiroshima,"It's so eerie to see just the dome of this building as a survivor and reminder of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. I read on the plaque that all the other buildings that were damaged from the bombing were demolished and then it came time to destroy this one and while some people were for destroying it because it reminded them too much of the pain and the war, others petitioned to save it and keep it as a reminder of what happened. I am glad it is there for people to visit and see.

The Dome Building is located by the water. It is a peaceful area inside the large Peace Park.

I learnt about the history of this building, the calls to demolish this as it reminded locals of the trauma of the bombing.

Japan,Atomic Bomb Dome,Humbling and Moving,"When we were planning our trip to Japan, we scouted out possible festivals and local events near where we would be staying. When we then came across the peace ceremony marking the 74th anniversary of the dropping of the first atomic bomb, I was both drawn to it and absolutely horrified. As an American, I wanted to show my respects for those innocent lives lost, yet was concerned that we wouldn't be welcomed. My fears were groundless, as every Japanese person we met was kind and gracious to us.

The dome, set amongst the bustle of a thriving, modern Hiroshima, is a stark reminder of both the worst of humanity as well as the best of it. To see how it remains when everything nearby was decimated, is frankly quite humbling. It's a wonderful reminder of the human spirit and we were so fortunate that we were able to visit during the peace ceremony.

While the ceremony takes place just once a year, it was a beautiful and moving experience. As we sat on the bank of the river, watching the paper lanterns float by with the dome lit up in the background, we met kind-hearted and lovely people from all over the world. It truly did feel like a peace ceremony, because everyone was respectful of the surroundings and history. If you have the opportunity to attend this annual event, by all means, please do.

Even if you don't, don't miss stopping by to pay your respects to those whose lives were changed forever on that horrible day. Like visiting a concentration camp, the site of the twin towers in NYC or Civil War-era slave quarters, it's a part of history that should never be forgotten.",

Japan,Atomic Bomb Dome,A sombre monument,"To preserve the remnants of this Government Building, was the best
way to illustrate the power and horror of nuclear warfare. It is a
chastening thought that this devastation was caused by an early atomic
bomb and that current devices are many times more powerful.

The huge force and intense heat generated by the explosion melted
metal and glass and this ravaged building bears silent testament to
the terrifying affects of atomic weapons.",

Japan,Atomic Bomb Dome,Must go-For those interested in history,"I did a day trip to Hiroshima from Osaka. It only takes an hour to travel the 200-300km between this two distant cities.

There atomic bomb dome is an easy tram (streetcar) ride from Hiroshima station. You will know you have reached the station when tourists alight and you can see the dome from the tram.

Certainly worth the visit. My family walked around the dome to try to figure out which direction was those world war photos of the done taken.

It is a sobering sight and you know that you are in a place with historical significance.

Certainly worth a day trip to visit from Osaka.",

Japan,Atomic Bomb Dome,A MUST SEE,"The Atomic Bomb Dome is the ruin that remained after a nuclear bomb exploded, on August 6, 1945, The bomb exploded almost vertically 600m above the police station and the structure was able to withstand the almost vertical blast, everything else in the radius of approximately 1600m was erased. About 100,000 people died in the blast including everyone in that building.
The Dome now stands as a memorial to this horrible event and is part of Hirshima Peace Park. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a place to visit and imagine what happened there. Don't miss the Museum that brings more background on the event. Remember that today nuclear weapons are orders of magnitude more potent than this ""tiny"" 15 kiloton bomb.",

This action transformed WW II, into a nuclear war, Pray we never have another one.

The Atomic Dome is located about 100 metres from the Hypocentre, where a hospital has now been built. This is a reminder of the destructive power of an atomic bomb.

It is startlingly beautiful in some ways - apart from what it symbolises - but the memorial and park hopes for better. Lots of foot traffic around the base -make sure you cross over the bridge into the park to get the views from there as well - as almost better.

BUT this is NOT ground zero of where the bomb actually struck - that is about 150 metres away in a small side alley, just commemorated by a small 'monument' - more a plaque. Worth googling to 'see it' as this fact in itself was interesting ie the site of ground zero recognised by most as ground zero is not ground zero.","Written May 21, 2019"
Japan,Atomic Bomb Dome,All that's left of the big city.,"The famous genbaku house became a symbol of world war II. It was left in ruins, as was the Kaiser Wilhelm Church in Berlin and the St. Nicholas Church in Hamburg. The former building of the Hiroshima chamber of Commerce and industry was designed by Czech architect Jan Letzel. Being only 200 meters from the epicenter of the explosion, the structure withstood the impact. The only building in the epicenter...Most of Hiroshima was made of wood and burned down. People who were in the epicenter of the explosion, instantly evaporated, enveloped in red-hot plasma, the temperature of which was about 4000 degrees Celsius. Powerful light radiation left only shadows on the walls of houses from human bodies. 9 of the 10 who were in the 800-meter zone from the epicenter of the explosion died instantly. The shock wave swept at a speed of 800 km/h, turning into debris all the buildings in a radius of 4 km, except for a few built with the increased seismic hazard. Letzel building withstood the shock wave thanks to the steel frame. It didn't just melt. As well as high-quality reinforced concrete. After the war, when the citizens of the city began to rebuild Hiroshima again, it was proposed to carry Genbaku. The anti-war movement of the 60s saved the memorial. Activists raised money to strengthen the structure, and collected half a million signatures in the 90's to make the house a world heritage site in 1996. The US government has actively opposed that, because It put Genbaku on a par with Auschwitz and perpetuated the problem of military expediency and compliance with the rules of warfare of the bombing of Hiroshima. The nuclear house continues to be a symbol-a warning to humanity about the catastrophic consequences of the use of nuclear weapons.",

It is easily accessible from the Hiroshima streetcar network and can be viewed from a relatively short distance from all sides. Some of the efforts made to stabilise to structure for future generations are not especially well hidden, but this may be necessary given the nature and degree of damage to the structure.

Japan,Atomic Bomb Dome,Quite like nothing on Earth...thankfully,"Visited Hiroshima on a day trip by bullet train from Kyoto and wasn't really sure what to expect. What I found was an unbelievably vibrant city that tells a story about the dropping of the atom bomb without any self pity or anger towards those responsible. The Atom Bomb Dome is haunting and strangely enigmatic as it remains a very real memorial to all those killed and effected on the day and aftermath of the dropping of the bomb. It really has to be seen to understand what it represents. The city have done an amazing job of preserving it and building the memorial park and peace gardens around it. A short stroll through the park takes you to the museum which tells the story of the atom bomb through the lives of those involved in its development and those killed and affected by it. Just a couple of hundred meters away is the plaque identifying the hypocentre of the explosion, again worth going to see if just to recognise the understated way in which the events of August 6 1945 are remembered.

Japan,Sengan-en,A Must Visit Location!,"We’ve seen many homes and gardens in Japan and Senganen was one of the most impressive. The house is not just historic it is gorgeous. The staff are helpful (some English spoken) and clearly proud to be working there. The gardens are really remarkable with ponds, small buildings, fountains and great walking areas. It’s March and there are lots of trees and flowers in bloom but it must be gorgeous most of the year. There’s a lot of English signage which is helpful along with young, enthusiastic staff. The shops are interesting with local traditional sweets along with beautiful crafts. We aren’t so fond of cut glass but the production here is a quite remarkable. Expensive and wonderful. We spent 3-4 hours wandering around and having lunch in the cafe - which was also quite good. Keep a watch for someone ordering one of the deserts with tea - the making of the tea is an interesting exhibition.",
Japan,Sengan-en,Beautiful gardens,Huge garden with the residence houses facing the volcano in Sakurajima. Enjoyed the walk round the gardens n the great view of the volcano. There are also some shops selling souvenirs as well as some local snacks.,

Japan,Sengan-en,Well maintained,A more professionally managed attraction than most I saw in Kagoshima with plenty of ‘spending’ spots tactfully scattered along the ‘suggested route’ but then they can as they have plenty to shout about with the glass manufacturing and so on. The garden itself is stunning with some delightful shrines and plenty of explanatory signs. All that is missing for botanically minded tourists is plant/tree labels. Easy to get to as the tourist/city bus gets there but it does get very crowded.,

Japan,Sengan-en,Zen and nice tourist attraction,This is indeed a zen place to visit to feel the tranquility. There is also a matcha cafe where matcha latte is served in a unique way. One can have a drink after walking around.,
Japan,Sengan-en,Nice view of Sakurajima.,"If you only have time to visit either Sengan-en or Sakurajima, I would recommend visiting Sengan-en. It has a nice cozy collection of gardens, eateries, houses and shops. Walking paths are easy. Accessible from Kagoshima Chuo Station, through the Kagoshima city view bus. There is a pass for ¥600 a day. However, a one-way ticket is ¥190 for adults, so if you are just going to Sengan-en and back, it is better not to get a pass.

A guidebook with bus timings are also available at the JR information counter next to the shops at Kagoshima chuo station.

Admissions are split between the Garden+Museum, as well as Garden+Museum+House. We opted for the former.

(Nice sweet potato soft serve ice cream near the entrance row of shops.)",
Japan,Sengan-en,Great view of Sakurajima,Recommended if you like gardens. There's also a shopping area for food and souvenirs and some restaurants. We also bought the full priced ticket to visit the house as well and it was interesting.,
Japan,Sengan-en,Beautiful landscape garden with great view of Sakurajima,"Driving down from Kumamoto, I chose Sengan-en to view Sakurajima, rather than go to the observatory or the prefectural building and I am glad I did. The gardens were constructed in the 1650's by the Shimazu family, which ruled the area for a considerable time. They couldn't have picked a better spot with its stunning views of Sakurajima and Kagoshima Bay. The residence, which was rebuilt in the late 1800's and the rooms show life at it was in those days. There are two restaurants and a matcha cafe, gift shops with local crafts of wood and satsuma kiriko (cut-glass crystal), and snacks, sweets and delicacies. Entrance is 1300 yen for the garden, museum and house (recommended) or just 1000 yen for the garden and museum. My wife and I spent about 3 hours there. This is one place that shouldn't be missed.","Written May 12, 2019"

Japan,Sengan-en,Clever Use of Borrowed Scenery,"Having visited 4 superb gardens in Tokyo & 1 in Hrioshima, this garden came as a dissappointment although in fact it is a very good garden. The major aspect is the opportunity to visit the House.
To gain entry to the garden a ticket can onlyt be purchased using one of the Automatic Machines. The attendants at the gate were rather brusque which for the Japanese I found very surprising.

The site cleverly uses the backdrop of the hills and across the water to Mount Ontake (& its smoking Volcano).

The site is basically long & thin. From the gate travelling east the garden stretches about 550m and at its widest (around the house) about 110m. Westwards from the Main Gate there are the musuems. Outside the site and to the western edge is the factory with it's showroom & visit to the glass-blowing.

Walking around the garden the parths are of shingle and this has a habit of getting into open sandals (best to wear shoes).

When we were there the main pond had been drined for maintenance and obviously could have looked better. Of note (apart from the House) whilst walking around was the Tin Gate, the Original Main Gate, the Jumping Lion Lantern, the Oniwa Shrine and the water-powered Rice Pounder.

In the shops the was very beautiful & expensive glassware for sale

Just outside the Site (by the car park) was the simple Tsurugane Shrine",
Japan,Sengan-en,"Enjoyable, despite the rain","It's wonderful to be a tourist. Why do I say that? Because it enabled us to visit Sengan-en (Iso-telen) garden in Kagoshima, Japan, which was very enjoyable, even in the rain and rain it did the day we visited. The grass was sparkling. Trees were greener than green. A delight for the eye and the mind. Visibility was limited. If not, we would have been able to enjoy views of Sakurajima. The garden (and villa) was the private property of the Shimazu family (and of the last Samurai), combining, said our guide, Edo period gardening and Meiji modernization. It's now a UNESCO heritage site. The Samourai used to arrive by boat. The main gate has direct access to the sea. Must have been an imposing sight indeed. The gate into the garden proper – not the outside gate – was for the Samurai only and for his son. He was tall, 1.80 meters, weighing over 100 kg. An imposing figure in his time. There’s a statue of him in Kagoshima and Tokyo. There are no queues. No discount for students. No dressing code. It's a garden.",

The garden boasts spectacular views of active volcano Sakurajima, and the house provides a glimpse into the lifestyle of a powerful feudal lord.” We paid the admission fee of 1,000 yen that allows you to visit both the gardens and Shuuseikan and as we made our way to the residence and main garden area there were gift shops with an extensive range of local products from food to craft. Following the gift shops we came to a recommended photo site with a spectacular view of Mount Sakurajima. The best view of the garden with the borrowed scenery in the back is admired from the best room in the residence. So I went as close as possible to the main residence to command this spectacular view. We next followed the path to the Kyokusui garden, where Kyokusui events are held. Sengan-en’s home page tells that the event “is an elegant poetry game originating in ancient China in which small cups of sake are floated down a winding stream. Participants dressed in traditional clothing sat along either side of the stream must write a waka poem before the cup passes in front of them. On completing their poems the participants take the cup from the stream and drink the sake.” I understand that if you pay an additional 600 yen, you can take a guided tour of the main residence. Unfortunately we didn’t have the time. In any event well worth the admission fee. Brochures are available in multiple languages.",

This garden of Kagoshima stands out as using Sakurajima (the volcano) and Kagoshima Bay as borrowed scenery. Further, there are tropical plants which are not seen in gardens in other parts of Japan.

The grounds are bigger than I thought and one should allow enough time to stroll through the grounds.

This garden is a popular sight of Kagoshima. I think most tourist groups visit sites in the morning. I didn't get there until 3:30pm to avoid the crowds. It was quiet and very enjoyable. The lighting at that time of day also works well with photos.","Written September 6, 2017"
Japan,Sengan-en,A Kagoshima Staple,"A short bus ride away from the heart of Kagoshima City, Sengan-en provides the perfect sanctuary for locals and tourists alike from the hustle and bustle of the city. The garden, which doubles as a UNESCO World Heritage site in conjunction with the adjacent Shoko Shuseikan, is where the powerful feudal Shimadzu family once resided. The site includes several restaurants that highlight the local cuisine in Kagoshima as well. For the penny-pinchers, you will be glad to learn that visitors can get TAX-free for souvenirs and even snacks that do not have to be consumed on site.

Despite visiting the site in the summer, without any special event going on, we found the gardens beautiful. For us, it was particularly interesting to note the Chinese influences, such as feng-shui and bamboo groves, that were incorporated into the garden. Remember to strap on a pair of sneakers as the garden is huge and even has a hiking trail leading to a panoramic view of Sakurajima and Kinko bay that you won’t want to miss. Although simple, don’t forget to pick up a fan at the entrance as it can get quite hot in the summer.","Written August 26, 2017"

Japan,Sengan-en,Beautiful. That is All,"I thought this place was absolutely beautiful. It offers a lovely walk with some pretty plants, great scenery and some lovely water features. I enjoyed wandering around on the sunny lunchtime I visited...it wasn't packed and was really very nice.

The view across to Sakura-jima is probably one of the best on offer in Kagoshima. Don't miss it.

The entry fee of Y1000 includes a museum in the price, but I didn't have time to visit it. There are a few restaurants, some shops and gift shops on site.

If you have mobility issues you will be limited to the lower half of the garden...which would be a shame as some of the nicest parts are a climb up step/uneven steps.

I used the cute pass to get here which I purchased from the tourist info desk at JR Kagoshima-chuo. It has plenty of frequent buses to the garden from the station and around Kagoshima.",

An added bonus of this bus tour is that it stops at all the main sights within 30 minutes driving from central Temonkan (i.e. Meiji Restoration Museum, Terukuni Shrine, Saigo Takamori caves/statue/burial site,Tsurumaru Castle ruins, Shiroyama Observatory AND Sengan-en Gardens to name a few). I recommend visiting Sengan-en in early Spring (when the cherry blossoms are in bloom) or in mid-Autumn when the weather is cool and beautiful daisies and the deciduous tree leaves begin to change colour (avoid rainy days or the rainy season). Sengan-en is set as a traditional Japanese garden which was owned by the Shimadzu family (leading clan) for over 350 years.

Japan,Sengan-en,A perfect place to spend the afternoon,"The garden is huge and requires a lot of time. There is much ground to be covered - plan to spend half a day at least.

We arrived in Kagoshima too early to check in to our hotel, so we took the bus to the garden. The annual Chrysanthemum Festival was on which was both a boon and a not so very. The chrysanthemums were spectacular, but they disrupted the plan and beauty of the garden itself. Pots of them lined the walkways, displays of all sorts were covered in the flowers, and placed randomly on the lower grounds - samurai, children’s playground toys, mikoshi etc.

We were most interested in the numerous old stone lanterns scattered throughout the grounds. The shapes were fascinating. We had read about and seen photos of two of the lanterns, but there are many, many more. We tracked down the tin gate, another structure often written about.

The garden is know for its borrowed scenery. The afternoon we visited was a bit overcast. The distant views were cloudy. The further in we walked and the higher up we got in the grounds, the better the view of Sakurajima was. We found a flat spot of land, overlooking the train tracks with views to the volcano. If you stand on one of the tables (probably frowned upon and should not be done) you can avoid the power lines for photos.

Sago palms, moss, autumn blooming flowers, a wandering stream with stepping stones - the garden was still very vibrant this late fall day. A huge, ancient tree, braced by enormously thick wires, loomed over the pond and the open space near the Residence. There were no koyo to be seen - the color was mostly green, or brown from the dead grass, though a few flowering plants were in bloom - and of course all those chrysanthemums.

Near the entrance are foundations of the Shuseikan Industrial Complex. For our autumn much of this were hidden behind chrysanthemum displays. The large iron cannon was quite impressive. The furnace where the cannon was cast is behind the cannon, and also behind the chrysanthemums. These were listed as world heritage sites in July of 2015 as Sites of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution

Japan,Sengan-en,"Unknown treasure, one of Japan's best gardens","This quite simple one of the best Japanese gardens to visit in Japan. As its in Kagoshima, its relatively unknown and so delightfully, if you are lucky, can almost have it to yourself on the right day.

What makes it so good? What do you want in Japanese garden? Senganen has almost anything that you wish.

The Garden: The garden is relatively large by Japanese standards so this allows you to explore it at your leisure and if you do it slowly will take up to 2 hours depending how long you want to linger. The garden has many nooks that are hidden around corners, behind moss covered stone walls and hedges cut in pristine condition. The whole garden is maintained immaculately and the attention to detail over such a large area requires a dedicated team. Small shrines, a mountain stream that bubbles through garden, changing seasons, the back of the garden framed by mountains and forest and you would never know you are just 10 minutes outside Kagoshima city.

Borrowed scenery: Perhaps the best in Japan!! They talk about borrowed scenery of Kyoto gardens but I have never seen any place better than Senganen. The garden is situated no more than 50 metres from Kinko bay that looks like a vast pond right before your eyes. The bay stretches across to Sakurajima, an active volcano only a few kilometres away which is simply stunning! as it rises magnificiently before you with its smoking peak. There is no better view in Japan from a garden, a must see for anyone who loves Japanese gardens.

History: Sengan-en was built by local Lord Mitsuhisa, the 19th head of the Shimadzu family in the early Edo period so this allows you to enjoy some ambience of old Japan as you imagine days gone past.

I went in summer, the green was a beautiful green but it seems that in different seasons the garden changes with the rhythm of nature. I was lucky, very few people were there during a weekday and and most of the time I could enjoy the garden by myself and soak up its ambience. There are grassed areas as well and some seating so you can rest and take your time. You could spend a whole afternnon there if you enjoy Japanese gardens and have the time.

Restaurants: There are some restaurants on the ground, modern buildings and tastefully done. You can go to the 2nd floor of one establishment and it has full sized windows with unobstructed views across Kinko Bay to Sakurajima. When I was there it quiet so you could stay as long as you wished and just enjoy the incredible view over a delicious lunch.

Shopping: As you come inside the Garden entrance there are some shops with local crafts, especially wood products from Yakushima, Kagoshima glassware and of course shochu!, the local distilled alcohol usually made from sweet potatoes that is famous all over Japan. Once again the the shops have been built tastefully, no hawkers outside, and you can just leisurely look through and pick up something if you like. If you aren't interested in shopping just go straight past them onto the garden.

I have lived in Japan for over 10 years, visited Kyoto and its gardens on numerous times, seen the most reputed gardens from all over Japan and I found this to be among one of my favourites. If you happen to be in Kagoshima you must go, you won't be let down. For those who really love Japanese gardens it's worth making the effort to to go to Kagoshima for an experience you will never forget and and a memory of sublime beauty that you will have for life.","Written December 12, 2014"

Japan,Sengan-en,Shows the history of Japan's industrialisation,"Treat this garden as a working lesson on Japan's shift to a modern industrial nation - this is not an example of a sublimely beautiful Japanese garden, although it has majestic views of Sakurajima, it just has too many practical and industrial elements incorporated within to be appreciated as a typical stroll garden. And has been marred by concrete paths and souvenir shops for the hords of visitors. For historical reasons it is however quite interesting to visit, especially if you are interested in Japan's modernisation - the museum next door should be visited also. But if you want to see a really lovely Japanese garden there are many much finer gardens to be seen elsewhere.
I also found the garden became quite crowded when overseas tour buses pulled in but noticed that many visitors did not explore the garden fully and there were many interesting 'hidden', quiet corners.","Written June 22, 2014"

Japan,Sengan-en,Great Introduction to a Japanese style Garden! Beautiful!,"This garden is such a beautiful garden! For nature lovers, I think you need at least 2 hours to really enjoy this garden. Good place to go for a leisurely stroll! This garden is a good way to see a Japanese-style garden. My husband and I, and our 12-year old son really enjoyed it and wished that we had more time. Very beautiful and scenic! Admission is around 1000Y ($10 USD) each with a child discount available.

We also took the Residence tour (extra 500Y/250Y elementary grade child ($5/$2.50 USD extra to get this tour). This guided tour enables you to see how the Shimadzu lived – you’ll actually see the inside of the house. Note, we had a Japanese guide but fortunately we were with somebody who spoke English. Even without having an English translator, however, I think it’s worth the extra $5 bucks.

There are set times for the tours and each take approximately 20 minutes. In addition, you will be served green tea and a small piece of dessert which has the insignia of the Shimadzu family (short tea ceremony). Note the green tea is a traditional Japanese tea, which is substantially creamier than the green tea you find in the US. It has a stronger taste, too. Note, my 12-year son did not like the dessert. My husband and I, however, enjoyed the tea and the mini dessert. Glad that we paid the extra $. If you're here, pay the extra $ for the Residence tour.","Written June 24, 2013"

We could barely see the water, and couldn't see Sakurajima at all. There is a ""residence"" in the garden that you can tour for an extra 500 yen, but part of that was sipping maccha at the end...I don't like maccha and have been in my share of edo jidai houses, so we passed. The museum that's included in garden admission is small, but worthwhile.

The garden is huge, about 50,000 sq metres, and has beautiful trees, waterfalls, streams, pavilions, shops, a shrine for cats (Nekogami Jinja), and a great view of Sakarajima.

I took 90 minutes to walk around the garden and look at the interesting items in the shops.

Two spots in the garden stood out for me - it was very inspiring looking up at the three huge Chinese characters (Senjingan) carved in the hillside and looking at Mt. Sakarajima spewing ash cloud across the bay.",
Japan,Sengan-en,worth to treck out to the garden,"very nice place to relax for a few hours, with nice views on the mountain. It was surprisingly popular, with lots of people there on a weekday morning. There are also lots of shops and restaurants, so a place to nibble a bit and try a few things. Overall, a nice activity in Kagoshima","Written November 29, 2012"

Japan,Sengan-en,Definitely worth the time and effort~,"To say that it's a beautiful park is perhaps an understatement... I agree with the rest of the reviewers that it's a park filled with its own history.. Although I wasn't able to see the full view of Mt Sakurajima due to the (very stubborn clouds as it was raining quite heavily shortly before i'd reached senganen, it was nevertheless, still a magnificient sight... If u have the time to spare, do go for the hiking trail... I'm sure that the view up there would leave u, kinda, breathless...","Written May 24, 2012"
Japan,Sengan-en,It is all about the view of Sakarajima,"On a tour of Japan it is easy to become blasé about the gardens. This one is larger than many but perhaps as a result seemed to lack that attention to detail that is such a feature of the most famous.

But the location by the sea with the views across the straights to Mt Sakarajima is what for me it was all about and this did not disappoint. After exploring the garden we took the waterfall walk which involves 30 minutes or so of uphill walking along a path through semitropical forest before arriving at the viewpoint where a vista of the gardens, the sea and the volcano is spread out at your feet. The view of the waterfall framed by trees comes almost as an afterthought. This for us was the highlight of the garden.

On a practical note the gardens are easily reached using the circular tour bus which departs from Kagoshima station. There are two rival companies which do not accept each others tickets, busses run every half hour throughout the day.","Written April 10, 2012"

Japan,Sengan-en,gorgeous garden with history,"Despite visiting in pouring winter rain when the famous ""borrowed landscape"" view of Sakurajima was mostly shoruded in cloud, my family and I loved this garden. The grounds are extensive and of course beautifully landscaped. Amazingly,the peonies were in full bloom (in January!) and charmingly protected from the weather in a way that exemplifies Japanese horticulture. The history of the property, as recounted in the optional tour of the homestead, shone a light on the role Kagoshima played in the modernisation of Japan. Fascinating. There's also a huge restaurant with lovely views and a superior gallery/shop worth a look even if you're not in the market for top quality glass and ceramics.","Written January 26, 2012"

The highlight of our trip to Nara.

Due to Coronavirus, Nara is bereft of tourists. The deer are hungry!!!! In Nara Park, they are everywhere.

You can purchase deer cookies for 200 yen per pack at many places around the park. (It is actually just round-shaped dried grass cakes.)

You can feed them. I was bitten(not painful), licked, head-butted(startling), snuggled, cooed at, followed for blocks, totally surrounded by fawns, stags, and does.

They are one photo opportunity after another.

There are many paths inside the park that leads to many of Nara's main tourist attractions. Just be careful not to walk on top of all the deer droppings.

Japan,Nara Park,100% Cuteness,"Nara is a small town on a Japaneese scale with just over 360 000 inhabitants, 40 minutes by train from Osaka. The city was Japan's first capital under the name Heijo-Kyō and 8 of the city's temples are today on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Nara Park. Where do I start! The park was established in 1880 and is one of Japan's oldest parks. The park houses several major attractions such as Todaiji Temple and Kasuga Taisha Shrine. Well over 1000 fallow deer also live here! In ancient times the deer was seen as saints and as helpers for the Gods and were well taken care of. They are still well taken care of. The fallow deers in Nara Park are wild and completely able to find food on their own. But, you can buy special fallow biscuits (shika senbei) to feed them if you want. The foundation that organizes this donates the profit to take care of the deers in the park. Many of the deers have learned to bow to ask for biscuits and they are just so incredible cute. The park itself is beautful and I can highly reccomend to spend 2-4 hours in the park - especially if you love fallow deers as much as I do :-)",
Japan,Nara Park,Filled With Deer and People,"We came here first on a day-trip from Kyoto to see the hundreds of tame, free-roaming deer before proceeding to some of the temples located in the 1,600-acre park and elsewhere. A huge grassy area, covered by countless sika deer and a mob of visitors greeted us. Many people had stopped at vendors, who sell special rice crackers to feed the animals, which are protected with ""national treasure"" status in Japan.

I thought they were real pests, pushing me and others from behind and sticking noses in pockets, demanding treats. One bit my tote bag but did not put a hole in it. As I had nothing to offer, they moved on quickly. Some became aggressive with those, who teased them with a treat and then withheld it. Sometimes, a group of deer would chase one or two visitors for handouts. Many of the animals allowed themselves to be petted and stood quietly for photos. Children seemed to be quite excited about being so close to the deer, laughing and stroking them. When the deer got tired of the attention and had consumed enough food, they would stride off or take a rest, many choosing a ditch at the side of a road for a respite.

We stopped in this part of the park, because one of my friends had not been here before and was curious about the deer. Less than 10 minutes and she was ready to move on with us to the Todaiji Temple and Isuien Garden, two more of the attractions in the park. My rating is for the deer area.","Written September 26, 2020"

During some seasons they get less treats so they may be more aggressive (little nibbles, or head butting to tell you they are behind you and want a treat). Also buy from a stand that doesn’t have a ton around, they know what you are about to do so once you buy and turn around yo have a bunch of deer in your face wanting the cracker.

Japan,Nara Park,Come for the deer,"You might come to Nara to see the Todaiji temple and it's well worth it. You start by entering Nara Park and you can't miss the deer.
They are incredibly tame and will bow their heads for you in anticipation of getting a piece of a deer biscuit that you can purchase onsite. I know you think they might bite but they just want the food. However, they will nibble at your pockets or purse or anywhere you might have stored the biscuits. Nara Deer are hungry, and this is not their first rodeo. They’ve seen tourists like you come and go all day. The deer want you to get to the important part of your tour. Please feed me!
In most cases, the deer will bow their head and indicate they wouldn’t mind a bit of cake. The problem comes from the herd mentality and when there is cake, more deer will join you.

The signs tell visitors to hold their hands up to the deer to show that you don't have any food for them, but this doesn't seem to work.

There are plenty of other attractions in Japan where you won't be at risk of physical harm from the animals.","Written February 16, 2020"

Japan,Nara Park,Bold Fallow Deers,"Last time I was in Japan was in the summertime and the fallow deers (daim in French) had bright white spots (deers don't have the spots). This time, in January, we could barely see the spots. From nice gentle creatures, they are now emboldened by tourists giving them food. If not fast enough, they will try to steal your bag, whether it contains food or not. They are in many parks on the main route to the big Bouddha.","Written February 9, 2020"
Japan,Nara Park,A park in the traditional zone,"This is the centre piece of Nara as its among many of famous tourist attractions. Its close to the bustops from the Station and very close to the Todaiji temple and the start of the walk to the Kasuga shrine.

Japan,Nara Park,Good area to walk with deer,This was such a lovely surprise to walk to around this beautiful park full of friendly deer and to walk towards the Todaji temple.,
Japan,Nara Park,Nicest park Ive been so far,"Im glad we did go here. We were greeted by lots of deers. We didnt buy the cookie though but they still came and greeted us with a bow. Fun to watch them rest, mingle and even snatch your bag 😜 The backdrop view was great too. This is the nicest park Ive been so far",
Japan,Nara Park,Interesting,"We had the 7-day JR Pass and took the Yamatoji Line from Tennoji Station to Nara Station.
It was a fair distance to Nara Park, so we opted for the Nara city Loop Bus, 1-day pass, which was a good decision, for 500y. You'll need to wait at Bus stop No.2. Walk out of Nara Station building and seek the locals' advice on where Bus stop No.2 is located. They'd be most willing to guide you.
There was a long queue, but it moved fast. The bus dropped us at Nara Park, which was so convenient.
We saw lots of deers roaming around. A few approached us leisurely. One, in particular, came up to us and began to sniff at our bags and pushed his nose against our bodies! One of my sisters was squealing in fright.
We didn't buy any crackers to feed them because we had the earlier experience at Miyajima Island, where they more you feed them, the more aggressive they become.
There were many people around, taking pics, and patting the deers. They seemed very tame here.
It was drizzling, the ground was wet and we had to use umbrellas. After taking some satisfactory pictures, we decided to take the city loop bus to see the rest of Nara city, while the younger ones in our group continued on to visit Todaiji Temple.","Written February 5, 2020"
Japan,Nara Park,Great day trip choice from Osaka. Lots of tame deer roaming around.,"I brought my brothers here during New Year's Eve and the park was packed full of people. The entire area was filled with festival stands selling amazing street food like grilled octopus, Kobe beef steak on a skewer, okonomiyaki, yakisoba, etc. There were tons of deer relaxing in the main thoroughfares, but most of them seemed a bit overfed as they were completely uninterested in the deer crackers that I bought. The ones further out in the less populated areas were more receptive in eating them. We never encountered any of the more aggressive deers though. All of them appeared completely used to being petted constantly. One of my co-workers suggests trying to feed them blueberries, but I never had the opportunity to verify if they like to eat them or not. All in all, it's a great day trip from Osaka.",
Japan,Nara Park,Dont buy the biscuits,"I know its surprising but you dont have to buy the biscuits, the deers will come to you regardless and let you pat them. If you have biscuits they will go crazy because they love the biscuits and do anything to eat all of the ones you have, so dont buy them! we didnt we spent 3 hours here and pat so many deers, and ones sitting near us and just laying in the sun.
We saw so many moronic tourists get jumped on/rammed because they were teasing the deers.
The poor deers are so food motivated but they cant help themselves and they become agressive, so remove the problem - biscuits - and then you're safe! easy fix.",
Japan,Nara Park,Not Bambi! And Don't Touch - I got Deer Mites!,"This location looked so charming! It is not.

1. I petted a deer, and got deer mites on my hands. Mites are not dangerous but I wasn't sure what they were, and wound up going to an Urgent Care in Honolulu and dermatologist (just to make sure the first doc was correct). I hadn't petted a deer since I was 10, and yielded to temptation - don't touch the deer!

2. The deer are aggressive. I had no food on me, and no explicit scent, and a deer came up from behind and pushed me with its head. Deer weigh a lot and I was startled - and frightened.

My husband bought the crackers and fed the deer. They gathered around him rapidly, which can feel overwhelming. However, what WAS overwhelming was that one deer took ahold of his pants below the knee. Fortunately, it let go, but that was not a pleasant experience.

I would never take a child near these deer. We saw kids teasing the deer with food - do the parents realize the risks?

There appeared to be no town officials providing advice or anything else.

If you want to go to Nara - they do have some lovely museums, stay away from the deer. They are NOT Bambi.","Written January 31, 2020"
Japan,Nara Park,Beware of the deer,"The walk uphill from the train station through narrow streets does not prepare you for the expansive Nara Park, full of beautiful gardens, shrines lakes and of course the deer. We were marginally early for the cherry blossoms but there were still lots of beautiful plum blossoms. When you buy food for the deer from one of the many vendors, keep it out of sight and feed isolated individual deer. Otherwise you will be ""mugged"" and pushed around by numerous deer that forget their manners and have no intention of bowing for their reward. The Todaji Temple is also worth seeing.","Written February 9, 2020"

We had a 6 month in tow, handy to know the bus station has a full baby feeding area. Great fun, just watch little ones around the deers at all times. Temples are great here. (Side note, when we got off the train it seemed like a lady tried to hussle us a “guided tour”. Easily shutdown and unusual for Japan)",
Japan,Nara Park,"Deers, deers, deers","Deers are everywhere, from the streets to temples and grass landscapes.
Droppings are also everywhere, but the locals are sweeping it up when they see it.
Dont get too concern with stepping on them.
Apparently i went during the mating season; where they may be more aggressive than what you have read in reviews, but everything seems normal... they are still aggressive.
Somehow those bigger deers with antlers are more docile than the younger and female ones. You feed one, then u have another 5 butting you, nipping on your legs and waist. I almost have to run at times.
Just raise up your turning hands to mimic that you do not have biscuits or food, it works!
Overall it is an experience!",
Japan,Nara Park,Advice below on how to avoid an aggressive deer.,"It is an awesome experience, not only for my boys, but also for the parents! We are lucky we have a very informative tour guide who informed us on what to and not to do with the deer in the park to avoid aggressive behaviors of them. If you feed them, they will surely gather around you, but they are trained too. Just show them that you have empty hands, and they will leave you alone. They were, so far, very friendly with us. We definitely had a lot of fun!",
Japan,Nara Park,"Peaceful, Beautiful and lots of Deer","Nara Park is a must to see and it's huge. Been there last month and the different colors and shapes of the trees and leafs are just simply unique, so as the view. If you go when there is not a big crowd, then even better because you can enjoy the peacefulness of the park.
Plenty of cute deers that you can feed. There are local people selling the proper snack so you can feed the deers and it's pretty cheap and reminds me a thin smelly waffle. But 1st do show respect and do a small bow to the deers before you feed them. They will do the same. It's amazing and fun!!
There are signs as well, to be careful with them as even though they are cute, you can't forget that they are wild animals and walk freely.

Probably I don't have to write it, but ....Please do respect this beautiful place and don't trow any of your garbage on the floor as the deer might eat it and you will be spoiling a beautiful place.
Better take a little bag for your garbage and then bin. I took a plastic bag from a deer's mouth, that was trying to eat it. Not cool.",
Japan,Nara Park,A beautiful autumn day,"I was here in November, but just before the proper autumnal colours had arrived...nonetheless it was beautiful!

I spent quite a lot of time wandering around the park in the quieter places away from the areas near the main road. I saw plenty of deer as you would expect as Nara is famous for them, but also met loads of local people wanting a chat. Honestly it was a really memorable part of my trip.

I got here on the bus from JR Nara, but walked back in about 20 mins.",

You can feed the deer but they can get too friendly!
Entertaining to watch though!",
Japan,Nara Park,Absolutely beautiful place with deers running around,"Nara Park is not a specific location. Asking where to find deer in Nara is like asking where can you find water in the Pacific. They’re literally everywhere in the temples complex. Just go to Todai-ji temple and the entrance is filled with deers trying to come and lick you. The park adjacent to it and covering a large part of Nara city’s central area is full of deers. You can feed them if you wish. There are many hawkers selling deer snacks for 100 yen, and giving them snacks causes them to congregate. You don’t necessarily need to walk in this park to enjoy feeding the deers, it’s just a very nice preserved attraction by the city of Nara to enjoy time with these cute animals.",
Japan,Nara Park,Great experience with Nara deer,"Cute deers and they interact with tourists. You can treat them biscuits that can be bought inside the park for 180 yen. Just walk deep inside the park, more deers you can find.",
Japan,Nara Park,A wonderful day trip for the family,"Kids love trying to feed the deer. They’re so overfed that amongst the dozens of deer at the front of the park, it took half an hour to find deer that would eat all the biscuits we bought.

There are plenty of deer inside as well so you can hold onto the biscuits and feed the more hungry ones inside.

We saw a man standing in front of 3 deer. He bowed and they bowed back in return for treats. It was very cute! My kids tried it later with some other deer and it worked!",
Japan,Nara Park,Loved feeding the deer!,"Had such a great time feeding the beautiful deer! We bought deer crackers and were amazed when they immediately came toward us and bowed asking for a snack. Be aware however, once they know you have food, they can get a little aggressive. I provided a cracker to one, then turned to feed his friend and the first one bit my coat evidently informing me he wasn't yet finished! It wasn't hard enough to rip my coat or anything, it was more funny than scary. Just thought I'd mention it in case you're traveling with children. They're truly beautiful creatures.

I afraid of them a little bit because I saw many people were been chased up by the deers. And they who were been chased up are taken the crackers. So I didn't buy crackers, but my friends are bought. However, the deers have not chased up my friends. They were harmless and tame. Maybe I have the wrong idea for them. I had an amazing moment with the deers. I had fun here, so I recommend it here for everyone.","Written January 5, 2020"

Japan,Nara Park,Returning to nature among gods and deers,"We visited Nara park and stayed there overnight, in a very comfortable inn, with wifi but no tv, wich was wonderful. The park is splendid, with its many temples and shrines scattered all around. The deers are everywhere, some of them more interactive, expecting to be fed with the proper food you can conveniently buy in the park. Others just pass or lie there, only to be admired, never in fear of humans. It is beatiful to watch. Your children will learn quickly how to distribute food among those that may come to you. Ideal if you respect nature and animals and if you like long walks in beautiful surroundings. Men and nature managed to create in Nara an absolutly unique place.","Written January 1, 2020"

We rode a bus from the train station to the park, which was easy and short.

A large grassy park with oodles of adorable deer. The novelty wears off when the deer start gouging their horns into your children, or biting at your clothes and skin. Apparently not all of the deer care for the ‘hand signals’.

The toilets are the worst. I’m not a precious person, and I’m pretty tolerant of all kinds of smells but - wow. Bring as much hand sanitiser as you can carry.

We managed to go on a hot day, the museum was closed, and one of our kids got sick. We walked back to the station without seeing anything else.",

Japan,Nara Park,BOWING DEER & History & Temples,"This was our first venture out of our AirBnB, we used our Kansai Thru Pass (great deal, it includes almost all public transit except JP rail) to get there which was about 1.5hr rail ride. There is a market just outside of the train station (sorry I forgot the name) that has nara themed gifts and food. The park where the deer are is just a short walk up the street on the right. There will be a few carts/vendors selling these waffle crackers for the deer, about 200 jpy for a stack ***hide the stack from sight ASAP. My advice with the deer:
- go to an area with one or two deer
- keep one waffle in one hand and the stack in the other
- offer up a waffle, but bow when you do it - they will bow back, give them the waffle
- the waffles are big so you can break them up easily to make them last longer
- IF YOU ARE BEING SWARMED BY DEER - hide the waffles and show them BOTH of your empty hands, they will go away
- watch behind you, some of them like to bump you for attention

Ok, if you keep walking inland after the deer there are signs for the temples, you can walk around most of them but if you want to go inside the two big ones then you can buy a double entry ticket for a discounted price. After the temples and down the hill there is a wonderful little pond with a scenic view, a good place to rest and eat some food if you bought anything from the street leading away from the pond (I got a fresh red bean hot mochi just a short walk away - yum!)",

The gentle deers will crowd over you, nudge you and even chase you for their delicious treats. Don't be afraid, they don't bite.

Japan,Nara Park,"Beautiful park, lovely deer and amazing temples","Anybody who likes one of the three things I mentioned on title will obviously have a great day in the park.

Not too far from Osaka, you can easily reach Nara in 40 minutes from Namba station to Nara Kintetsu station.

The park was full of colourful leaves as I visited the park during autumn. Absolutely beautiful.

The deer is my highlight. They are amazing and can interact with human nicely.

Japan,Nara Park,Deer,"You have to make sure you go early, we took the 8am train out of Nippombashi, so that you beat the tour buses. Once it gets crowded, it really isn’t much fun. In the morning, you can walk around and enjoy the park and the temples. We were pretty fortunate to visit while there was fall foliage and it was beautiful. The deer would follow you around, and some are actually a little more persuasive than others, but otherwise they were gentle and minded their own business for the most part. Deer crackers were ¥150 for a stack of about 8 pieces. It’s a short train ride from Osaka so spending a morning here is a great idea! The food and souvenirs are expensive though, so maybe bring a packed lunch or wait til you get back to Osaka.",

Japan,Nara Park,Our very favorite spot from out trip to Osaka,"The Nara park is definitely worth a full a day trip. The park is unbelievably vast and beautiful with friendly, brave deer walking around the place. Take your time walking around and photographing everything, but remember to respect the boundaries, and take a while to just breathe and enjoy the view of this sanctuary.
The temples, the stairs, the shrines and the monuments are breathtaking. Whether you love architecture, history, animals or nature, this place brings it all together.
It's a little difficult to find a place to eat here, although there are many, but they're scarreted around and if you ream free, you could end up just not running into any of them. I would not be afraid of getting completely lost, though, for there are always people around to ask for help.","Written November 28, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,"Not very special, except deer.","The park itself is only so, so. There are lots of deer roaming around freely which is fun for Kids. If you have more time to spend than you know how to fill up, then Nara can offer a laid back 'day off' from the busy city. You can safely skip Nara otherwise.","Written November 28, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Up close and personal,"Our trip to Japan was at the beginning of November. We decided on this park after reading reviews. We spent a lovely afternoon in the park, up close and personal with the deer. Many around, all keen and eager to approach as you open up the crackers. Crackers must be purchased from the small stores on entry. Lots and lots of people around but still enjoyable. The deer have obviously been taught well by their Japanese masters as we were captivated at how many times they kept bowing their heads to us in appreciation of their food. My daughter and I really enjoyed ourselves, despite the odd push, shove and little nips from certain deer so be careful!","Written November 25, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,The Best Park in Nara,"Nara park is the biggest and best natural park in Nara, Japan. We went on a holiday which means so many people. The parking place was quite far. Going to the park, there is a museum, deer park and temple. The deer comes from the mountain where they sleep, then they go to the park. These deer are so friendly, and the park sells biscuits for you to feed them.it is a very unique experience. The park is also so clean. This is a must see while in Osaka. It is about 1 hour from Osaka. Highly recomended.",
Japan,Nara Park,Exciting for children but exercise caution.,"This was our second visit to Nara. We discovered that deer around the great Buddha temple are more passive. On this trip our three year old daughter was just standing on a sidewalk when she was attacked by a deer. He charged and knocked her down and then later charged my wife. There are signs clearly stating that these are wild animals and can attack and those signs are true. Fortunately, there is at least one area where the deer are far more calm and passive. If you have small children you really must be very alert if you are strolling through the park. Viewing the great Buddha is a must. Very impressive. We arrived too late to view the museum so no comments about that. Also, take the bus or walk from the train station. Taxi fares are super expensive (for the relatively short drive).","Written November 23, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Worth seeing,"Nara Park is a train ride from the centre of Kyoto, but well worth the trip. Deer roam freely and nod their heads, Japanese style, when offered food which is really cute. They are not the real reason to go - that's to see the various world heritage sites all in one place. There are magnificent temples and the huge golden buddhas.","Written November 21, 2019"

Japan,Nara Park,Home of Sika Deer : the Messengers of the Gods,"Nara Park is one of the must-see areas in Nara City. Sika deer who are considered messengers of the gods freely live in the park. Most reasons of tourists to visit Nara Park is coming close, taking photos and feeding the deer with ""Sembe"" (deer cracker). Most of them who have been cut antler are hungry all times. Some of them bite or bow to visitors to ask for food, steal food from hand, bite the hands while feeding. Be careful walking on deer stools and walking up to the deer and take a photograph with them or feed them with deer crackers.","Written November 19, 2019"

Japan,Nara Park,Nara Park Tour,"We toured the World Heritage Nara Park with Yoshi, a walking tour guide. It was a small group and we all met Yoshi at the Nara train station to begin our walk. We took a bus to the far end of the park and walked our way back over the next 3 hours. Yoshi was an excellent guide and had us feeding deer and touring the Kasuga Shrine, the Todai-Ji Temple and the Kafukuji Temple. She also explained the history of the site, customs and gave us an understanding of how Buddhism and Shinto religion relate to each other in Japan The cost was 3000 yen and included admission to the Todai-Ji Temple and food for the deer. We didn't have to pay until we met Yoshi. Worth every penny","Written November 18, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Good place to de-stress,"It was a lovely get away from the busy city.
Do take note which train you are using to visit this place. 1 train station is Nara station (15 mins walk) and the closes station to the Nara park is called Kintetsu Nara (5 mins)

There are plenty of deer around the park. Be careful with your deer biscuit - don’t show the whole stack biscuit on your hand otherwise their will come in a group to greet you.

Some deer will bite if you don’t give them biscuit. Please be careful and watch after your small children.

It’s best to have a sign - to find where is the rubbish bin to dispose all this biscuit wrapper.
Even the toilet nearby the temple don’t have a rubbish bin.","Written November 17, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,"So many deer, so few biscuits","We really enjoyed our walk through Nara park. The autumn colours had started to show and it was wonderful to stroll among the ponds and deer.

Japan,Nara Park,Amazing,"It's simply amazing how Japan can make modernization, technology, wildlife, and nature live in harmony together.

The experience of being close to wild deers is just one of those simple joys and priceless experiences.

Being mugged by deers just to get that deer cracker is fun, exciting and scary at the same time.

You should not miss this experience! This is definitely a must!","Written November 15, 2019"

You can purchase deer crackers for 200yen to feed the deer from many places in the park, you can't miss them!

Todai-Ji Temple is a must see whilst here. You can even squeeze through a hole in one of the ancient posts to become (more) enlightened!

One of the highlights of our trip!",

Japan,Nara Park,"An Incredible up-close visit with ""wild"" deer","We were told there would be deer ... lots of deer ... at the Nara Park. But there were more deer than I think I have ever seen in my life! We were told that they were ""wild"". But given the amount of interaction they have had with humans, they were very docil ...

... unless they thought you had food in your back pocket or hidden in your carry bag. Then they got a bit aggressive. Many people who bought ""deer cookies"" to feed them discovered that in addition to attracting lots and lots of deer that some of them must have felt they were being overlooked and nipped at your pockets or hands.

There were a lot of people at Nara. But I think there were even more deer. Big ones, little ones, deer with antlers, deer following you, deer just sitting patiently everywhere ... even deer sitting under the sign to the Todaiji Temple.

You have got to go there. It was an experience beyond expectations. Bambi lives!",

We were there at evening time and witnessed the beautiful sunset on the background with many deers early getting fed by the visitors - such beautiful setting !
We will visit again if we are back in Japan.","Written November 9, 2019"

Japan,Nara Park,Deer are friendly or some are a bit agressive,"We bought crackers three times. Once along the main path towards the temple with the buddha. The deer there were aggressive. You had to run away as soon as they handed you the crackers. Don’t be afraid. Parents with small children, same the little ones the trauma of possible aggressive deer and feed them yourselves or risk crying children. Some deer do bow. Once you walk a bit further in the park, we saw more friendly deer. We loved this. And we’ll come back everytime we’re in the country.",
Japan,Nara Park,Hungry Deer,"We hired bicycles near the station and rode through the park which helped cover bigger distances in the short time available. we weren't always sure where we could ride and where we had to leave the bikes though. Lots to see including impressive structures, thousands of deer and forest. Deer get a bit excited and pushy - especially the males in mating season! Be careful to avoid the poop everywhere too. Worth a visit though.","Written November 8, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Fun with deers,"The deer park is very big if you consider the surrounding temples. You can find the deers everywhere. It is easy to have a snapshot with the deers. Very often, they would sit or stand still.Generally they are calm. You can make them bow for their cookie.","Written November 8, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,"Yes, the deer do bow","If you've come to see the wild deer in Nara Park who supposedly bow when offer food, you might expect to see a few contained animals. What you actually see are hundreds of deer. And they are not contained in the park. They walk all over the streets and in the shrine area. Buy the treats that are sold and spend an hour feeding these animals for a surprising time.","Written November 6, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Must-do place - feed the deer!,"Pictures and travellers' accounts don't lie, you can feed the wild deer which roam the area.

Japan,Nara Park,Nara Park,"It is one of the best highlights of my Japan trip. You have to stay at Nara Park half day or whole day to enjoy the deer. Beware of those deers with horns as they will run into you if they see you have food. You have to show them your hands are empty so they will stop attacking you. But overall, twas a nice experience. I stayed at the park the whole day just to enjoy na nature and the deer. Very relaxing exeperience.",
Japan,Nara Park,Walk with deers and enjoy beautiful ponds with maples,"It’s a beautiful and peaceful park. You can see deers everywhere to walk with you and ask your food. Don’t feed them too rush and too many, just little by little and avoid attracting too many deers around you, otherwise you may feel scared. I like to sit on the grassland to enjoy the calm atmosphere. Luckily we can see some red maples even it’s early November.","Written November 3, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Must-do,"Initially I was worried to see how these animals are treated but they are 100% free to roam around Nara park and the surrounding areas- they even cross the roads and climb up stairs just to have a look at what is going on. You can buy deer biscuits for 200JPY which the deer love. Do NOT feed them your own food. They BOW before taking the biscuit out of your hand. The ones who want to be left alone are having little snoozes in the sun and don’t approach you.

It was very nice to escape the concrete jungle of Osaka and be in lovely fresh air with friendly, happy animals.

TIP: Nara is small (but beautiful) and I would recommend day-tripping from Osaka and wouldn’t stay in Nara just for this activity.",
Japan,Nara Park,Fun to feed the deer,"My daughter, who lives in Japan, took me to Nara park on a beautiful fall day-Halloween actually. We were a little early in getting the fall foliage colors but it was still a very relaxing walk. Several temples to check out for a price if you want. The grounds are very well kept. Great fun feeding the sometimes pushy deer. As soon as the bag of food is open they follow you everywhere. When the food is gone you’re of no use to them anymore. Haha. When the colors of the trees start changing I’m sure it’s spectacular!",
Japan,Nara Park,Good stuff and not so good stuff,"It's worth a visit to experience the deer roaming freely on the streets. But, as other reviews state, the deer can be a little aggressive.

If you want to get away from the crowds, and the aggressive deer, you can climb to the top of the big hill near the park. Less people, less deer and a nice view of Nara.

It's a bit of a hike, but it's worth the effort.",
Japan,Nara Park,Must visit,Nara park is a must visit if you’re around Kyoto/Osaka area. You can visit the deer in the park or walk to the nearby Todai-ji temple where there are more deer. Buy the crackers (only thing you should feed the deer) and allow them to bow their heads for some crackers. Hint do not show them all your crackers and if they become aggressive show them your empty hands. They are very used to humans. The male deer have their antlers cut off (sadly) so they cannot hurt humans. Do not run from the deer they will chase you! Overall good experience.,
Japan,Nara Park,Nice quick day trip to Nara,"Since we were staying in Kyoto and going to Osaka afterwards, we decided to stop by Nara for a few hours since it was ""on the way"". We suggest taking the express train instead of the regular train since it makes fewer stops and will get there quicker. We left our luggage in the lockers at Nara Station (very convenient) and took a taxi to Nara Park (since it was faster than taking the bus and comparable fare since there was four of us). The park itself is quick huge so we decided to walk over to Todaiji Temple since we didn't have too much time in Nara. There were many deer all over the park and seeing them was okay for us, as we've seen deer and other wildlife in the wild before. It was interesting seeing them interacting with the public though. I would've given the park itself three stars but gave it an extra star with the temples, shrines, and other spots of interested located within it's boundaries.",
Japan,Nara Park,Beautiful!,"This park is a MUST DO in Nara. It's filled with gardens, shrines, temples and woods. And of course, you must experience the bowing deer! They are literally EVERYWHERE. We really enjoyed spending a day here.","Written October 23, 2019"

You can buy some deer snacks from the vendors for 200yen, only feed the deer the deer snacks, otherwise they can get sick.
The park is large with many trees and very useful maps. Naras most popular temples and shrines are dotted around the parimeter.

We would recommend exploring this area on a day trip from Kyoto.",
Japan,Nara Park,Good for an hour or so,"This is the place to go if you'd like to spend some time with wild but tame animals, deer in this case. Their numbers were sparse when I went, not the hundreds that many other reviews state. Probably 50 tops, but it didn't detract from the experience still.

It's a 10 minute walk or so from Kintetsu-Nara station, you can grab some food at the connected Higashimuki shopping district before heading to the park also. When first reaching the park there were just a few deer. Walking deeper revealed more deer and there's more around Todai-ji Temple.

Do buy some senbei (deer cracker) for 150 JPY so you can enjoy a closer interaction with the deer as they come to you for food. I haven't had aggressive deer apart from one which was closer to the road heading towards Yoshikien Garden. Guy walked from behind me and bit my leg through my pants. Hurt but didn't leave a mark and it's okay, it's an animal

Do not show all of your food to the deer, and a tip we learned from a musuem or visitor center nearby with information about Nara is make sure the deer sees your hand empty after they eat from you so they know you don't have any more food.

As the title states, 30 - 60 minutes is good for this place.","Written October 23, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Ups and downs,"Overall Nara was great for a day trip out of Osaka to get away from the hustle and bustle of the shopping and nightlife.
However, we were unsure how to feel at Nara park with all the tourists feeding the deer these cookies you can buy. Hopefully these cookies are designed for the deer and good for their stomachs because they are fed them pretty much constantly.
The deer were very cute and friendly and seemed very accustomed to the crowds of people, but I did feel badly that we were all up in their business. It was almost like an open concept zoo but with only deer..
The park is quite huge so hopefully the deer can escape into the less touristy parts.

Overall this was a nice place for a day trip, even with all the tourists the park was very nice and there are lots of places to get food and things to see, like the museum and nearby shrines. However, I think it would be better if tourists couldn’t feed the deer and could only observe them.","Written October 22, 2019"

They are tame when left alone. However do be cautionary when feeding them, some do bite and touch you when they see you holding the rice crackers.

Some do tend to snatch papers (your map) from your hands, and they eat them. Or eat leftover rubbish on the ground.

And the park does tend to get a little dirty with their dung. Perhaps park staff should look into these factors.",
Japan,Nara Park,Oh Deer!,"Make your way to Nara and enjoy some local ""wildlife"". You can buy special deer crackers and feed the relatively tame beasts if you dare. I was out of crackers and one of the deer started to bite my pockets and then proceeded to take a nibble of my leg! It did not hurt but I was unprepared for this brazen attack! It was funny seeing Chinese tourists run away from multiple deer as they clutched lots of crackers. We even saw a 2 year old get head butted, but the little guy didn't cry or make a sound. He was totally fine so then it was funny. It is a surreal experience to interact with these normally reclusive and skittish animals.

We picnic lunch from 7/11 and went to CoCo Ichibanya for dinner afterwards. I think the whole day cost us about 5000 Yen including both meals.

It's easy to get to and walking distance *(follow the crowds) from the train station.

If you think you've bought enough biscuits for the deer, you're wrong. Buy more, the deer will thank you.","Written October 10, 2019"

Japan,Nara Park,Highlight of our trip,"If you have kids and you're in Kyoto or Osaka, you should come here. Feeding the deers was the highlight of our trip for the kids (and adults). Our kids loved it so much, they asked if they could go back again. The deers nip me a couple of times, some are pretty aggressive.","Written October 8, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,What an experience,"What a fun experience this was, most fun seeing people buy biscuits & be chased/harassed by the deer (in a friendly way)!
I Got a great giggle & a great selfie! The park itself is beautiful and as expected it was packed with tourists.
We visited the todai ju temple, insuien gardens and we also attended a tea ceremony. You could spend a day or two in Nara it’s such a big area with plenty to do at a nice steady pace!",
Japan,Nara Park,Not Impressive,In the park there are an abundance of deer. They are very tame and they follow you arround looking for food. It is said that if you feed them they will bow to you. I watched as many of them were fed by others but I did not see any of them bow. They are not to be fed with everyday food. You can feed then with the crackers that can be bought from the vendors arround the park.,"Written October 8, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Nice time with the Deers,"Nice afternoon with the deers!

They are tame when left alone. However do be cautionary when feeding them, some do bite and touch you when they see you holding the rice crackers.

Some do tend to snatch papers (your map) from your hands, and they eat them. Or eat leftover rubbish on the ground.

And the park does tend to get a little dirty with their dung. Perhaps park staff should look into these factors.",
Japan,Nara Park,Oh Deer!,"Make your way to Nara and enjoy some local ""wildlife"". You can buy special deer crackers and feed the relatively tame beasts if you dare. I was out of crackers and one of the deer started to bite my pockets and then proceeded to take a nibble of my leg! It did not hurt but I was unprepared for this brazen attack! It was funny seeing Chinese tourists run away from multiple deer as they clutched lots of crackers. We even saw a 2 year old get head butted, but the little guy didn't cry or make a sound. He was totally fine so then it was funny. It is a surreal experience to interact with these normally reclusive and skittish animals.

They do bow their heads (some more then others) to get crackers from time to time which is pretty cool. It is a nice place to visit and you can walk around some temples close by if you would like as well.","Written October 6, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Deers and temples,"Nara is ca 40 min metro ride from Osaka. Nara is famous for its park, full of deers and the temple.
Be careful of deers, especially if you have those cakes that are sold and deer seem to love. The deer easily check your pockets and ones with horns can push quite aggressively. Bowing is important for Japanese and these deer can bow for the cakes.
Visit also Todai-ji Temple and others.
Summary: Very nice with children, however deers are wild life and unpredictable.","Written October 6, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Filled with deers and nature,"Note that the park is nearer to (Kintetsu-Nara line) as compared to (JR Nara Line). Although you can still walk there from JR Nara Line (Takes abot 10 - 12 minutes).

For first timers, do note that holding onto the biscuits in plain view will make you a lighthouse for the deers. You will be swarmed!! (Watching people getting chased around was funny). Try to bring a small plastic bag to keep the biscuits in if you intend to buy a few stacks. Also, the deers are known to sometimes chew on your shirt/shorts. So if you intend to wear your better outfit, do be careful!","Written October 5, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,"Oh dear, my deer 🦌!","A lovely park with loads of friendly deer roaming around looking for deer biscuits.

Vendors sell biscuits that is approved for feeding deer ¥200.

Do keep belongings safe/guarded and please act responsibly - a tourist dropped his tourist map and was quickly picked up by a deer. My partner and I had to gently wrestle it out of its mouth, but not before it devoured some of it!

Tip: you can catch the JR line to JR Nara and don’t be put off by guise books saying it’s a bit of a hike. And don’t bother with the bus either. The walk from JR NARA station isn’t that far and quite a pleasant street to walk up.

Tip #2: keep a look out for where you step - there is deer poop everywhere! :)
(Especially of you have small kids)",
Japan,Nara Park,Worth a visit,"This is a must when visiting Nara. The deer are friendly and you can buy food which they take gently.

Japan,Nara Park,Stop feeding the deer,The Todaiji temple was excellent - the guardian statues and the giant Buddha were magnificent. The feeding of deer was horrific to watch ... children and adults alike teasing deer with wafers just to get a selfie. The male deer had their antlers cut off just so tourists do not get rammed. The Kasuga shrine with its moss laden lanterns was great to see but once again the deer feeding and touching detracted from the experience.,"Written October 2, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,It’s all about deer.,"As the title said, you can see the deer everywhere. And get the deer food at the stall which located around everywhere. It’s only 150yen for one packet.

Japan,Nara Park,Unique deer park,"Nara deer park is unique and well worth a visit. There are deer roaming everywhere, even in the middle of roads!
You can pat and feed the deer. Be warned that they will mob you and push you around when they see you buy a pack of biscuits, this can be overwhelming for small children.
The general Nara area has nice to walk around and the train ride there has interesting scenery.
My only negative - I’m not sure how healthy it is for the deer to be eating biscuits all day every day.","Written September 29, 2019"

Japan,Nara Park,Unforgettable morning in Nara with Reiko-san,"We were a group of four friends from Serbia visiting Japan for the first time. We have heard about Nara, its nature and dears, but honestly, we were not well informed about its historical and cultural importance. However, we were quite lucky to meet Mrs Reiko Imayoshi at the JR train station in Nara and to have her as our guide. In Todai-ji temple Reiko-san gave us very useful information about the architecture of the Buddhist temples, the sculptures/representations of Budha and the history of this particular temple, while in Kasuga shrine we were introduced to the basic concepts of the ancient Japanese religion, enjoyed the nature and even were encouraged to feed the dears, which we did for the first time in our life.
We are so grateful to Reiko-san for planning carefully our limited time in Nara and for showing us the most important monuments as well as the most impressive segments of the Nara Park thus making the most of our short visit to this wonderful place. Furthermore she gave a great insight into the Japanese contemporary lifestyle and values and she was a wonderful and friendly companion.
The route with Reiko-san included the bus transfer from the train station to the Nara Park as well as the tickets for the park and the Todai-ji temple for the quite reasonable price.
Reiko-san, arigato gozaimashita!

Japan,Nara Park,Deers and lots of tourists,"The park itself is gorgeous and definitely worth the visit. You can spend a whole day here without getting bored if it wasn’t for the hordes of tourists. There are just too many people making the place crowded and loud. They should initiate some type of a reservation system to limit the amount of people because it definitely deters from the atmosphere.

One of the main attractions here of course are the deer. They are everywhere and are not afraid of people. You can purchase deer crackers and feed them but be careful as they can get very pushy when they see the food. On the other hand, through, when you feed them a cracker you would receive a very polite bow - even the deer are well mannered in Japan :-)))","Written September 18, 2019"

Japan,Nara Park,Wall to Wall Deer,Nara is a must visit on your itinerary but keep in mind that you move near or through Nara Park to see most sights. The travel brochures that show a few isolated deer wandering around miss the fact that there are absolutely 1000’s of deer and they get close and personal as people love feeding them. Unlike Myajama where there are smaller numbers of deer and you are continually advised not to feed them. To be honest I am no deer expert but there are way too many. As at 2017 official numbers were put at 1700 with 164 people injured by them in 2017-18 alone. Trust me this 1700 is under reported - double that and you might be close.,"Written September 14, 2019"

I really enjoyed being able to escape the heat at the refreshment area which provided a cool space to sit, free tea and water and also an earthquake feeling experience.

We were very careful with the deers and did not feed them with the biscuits sold all over the park (150yen per 10 pcs) - they will come very near you once they detect that you may have food. Sometimes they get abit more aggressive and would surround those people holding biscuits in their hands. Best not to tease them (holding biscuits and not feeding them while taking too long to take photo). As we were walking in the park, it was nice to observe how the animals move around.

Japan,Nara Park,Very cool park,"A huge park with a lot of shade and very interesting nature. A good place to escape the blazing heat. Unlike many other parks in Japan, it has a lot of vending machines and trash cans. Also a currency exchange machine (near the museum) and various shops.

Basically most attractions you will want to see in Nara are within this park.

Of course a huge and cute attraction are the hundreds of deers living in the park. They are totally friendly and absolutely free. They come very very close to humans and you can feed them special crackers that you can buy for 150 Yen a pack.

Now this should be common sense but I will still write it: These deers are wild animals. While they are very used to humans and friendly, they can bite, buck, stomp etc. so be careful, mindful of your children and pay attention to your trash, bags and food you might carry.",
Japan,Nara Park,First time with deers,"Going to Nara Park is a must do if you are in Kansai area. We went on a day trip on our own, riding the train from Kyoto to Nara. A few minutes walk from the train station, we experienced our 1st encounter with the deers who were just lazing around waiting for people to feed them. Walking thru the large expanse of the park, we encountered more deer and took some great shots of them and with them while feeding them. It was our first time to experience being with deers unhampered by fences like you see in the zoo. Overall, an experience not to be missed.","Written September 5, 2019"

Japan,Nara Park,Must go if you love deers,Get close to deers and touch them. The male deer’s are aggressive and will bite you slightly for biscuits. Their horns have been sawed off. It’s not as dangerous. There are vendors at the entrances selling biscuits. Cash only. There’s a lake for a short walk and restaurants to try.,
Japan,Nara Park,A lovely deer park,"Strolling around this park and feeding crackers for deer is the reason coming to Nara. Deers are walking in the park freely and they are not shy to ask for foods.
We had fun here, they are not so wild as I thought. I was with my young kid. I was so nervous when I saw my daughter beat the deer because it tried to eat my paper tag of the stroller. But the deer did not get mad, it may know that my daughter is very young kid and it did not bite her or kick her. The deer is very humanize.
There is a temple after passing through the deer park. It's just like all other Japanese temple. I went inside and made a wish then we heard back for lunch.
It was a very special and pleasant day trip.
I highly recommend you to come here.

Tip: Nara Park is a five minute walk from Kintetsu Nara Station  but 20 minute walk from JR Nara Station.

Tip: Hide your crackers as deer may steal them.

Tip: Go early as it's a popular spot, deers maybe full if you come here in late afternoon",
Japan,Nara Park,Tourists are killing deer (unintentionally),"Being around these amazing deer was a wonderful experience. But I also came away horrified. I was aware that the deer eat plastic which messes up their digestive system, and die as a result. The reality of this issue struck me when I spotted a doe fully invested in an empty plastic container and literally had to wrestle it out of her mouth.

I went back in the evening, when there were very few people and most of the deer had retreated into the woods for the night. It was impossible not to notice the plastic water bottles and other trash that had been left behind all over the park. Did people not realize they were killing the deer they had come to see? I did not see any signs in the park explaining that plastic kills deer, so yes, I think people don't even realize what they are doing.

Another thing I noticed was that there are very few trash cans in the entire park. If the park could invest in more trash cans, there would very likely be less littering - and thereby less unnecessary and unnatural deaths.

What the park needs: 1. Signs to make the public aware of the issue and the consequences of littering. 2. A lot more trash cans (a type that deer won't be able to get into or tip over).","Written August 31, 2019"

Locate in Nara, Japan it is a large 660 hectares park traversing the main city with small lakes and surrounded by UNESCO World heritage sites attraction including the Todaiji Temple and several shrines. Sika deers are considered holy here as a symbol of one of the Gods in Kasuga shrine. It is illegal to harm them but you are allowed to feed them by buying special designated Deer crackers (Shika Senbei) on the stores around the park. It is around 150 yen. Be mindful when feeding them especially if your surrounded by large groups of herds because they may overwhelm you and at the same time they do bite, especially the young ones. There are several novelty stores, food and restaurants nearby as well. If you wanna experience traditional Japanese rickshaw there are also rickshaw available for service. There are several openings in the park but we took the one near Todai-ji temple (will have separate review). The park is for the public and free. So from JR Nara Station we boarded bus from the East gate which is easily identifiable. The ride is about 8 M but you could also walk for about 40 mins. We took shot beautiful photos and videos together with the lovely deers and got to experience feeding them. So spots are peaceful, some are very chaotic (with many deers). You could also touch them but be very careful for the bite. Overall it was indeed a lovely experience with them I will surely be back here at Nara Park when I visit Kansai, Japan.",

It is amazing to get so cloase and to see them bowing for the deer biscuits. The area is lovely with loads to walk around and see, can be busy but due to the size you can just walk elsewhere and find a quieter spot.

I pushed my daughter out of the way and tried to feed them as quickly as possible, thank goodness she wasn't holding the crackers!
We walked along the path to the temple, and found other stands selling crackers, and there are less deer assembled, so feeding them is much more enjoyable.

Japan,Nara Park,Getting up close with the deers,"Accessible by buses from the train station.

Never wear brand new or expensive shoes to this park as stepping on the deers' poops are inevitable (they are everywhere, so are the deers).

The deers are already used to humans feeding them with the deer senbei (wafers) that you can purchased around the park. They will bow to you, in return you are to offer them with the wafers. They may become slightly if they are not presented with food, and nibble on your bag or clothes, so do make known to them if you do not have food available (show them your open & empty palms).

Other than that, they are really nice to hang out with.

I must also highlight, please refrain from feeding any other types of food (and definitely not non-edible stuff, because I have witnessed it there!) except the wafers made just for them. Let's help keep the nature & animals alive for our future visits.","Written August 13, 2019"

After feeding them, be sure you go to Nara machi, where you can see the houses people lived in 150 years ago. On the way to Nara machi, you may see the famous rice cracker performance!! 東大寺、興福寺、依水園はたくさんの人が訪れますが、奈良町はまだあまり観光客が訪れていないように感じます。","Written August 10, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,lots of deer,"We really enjoyed our time in the park. There are deer everywhere. Most of them are pretty tame. There were some that were over zealous for food. We noticed that many of them bowed if you bowed to them. The kids took a ton of selfies with them, so it was a good social media spot. Just watch out for the tons of deer stuff all over the ground.","Written August 8, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Kids loved it,"Very relaxing in the park. The deer roam around and some of them will even do the bowing motion if you do it in return for deer cookies.

great pictures can be taken as they are very timid but can get a little feisty when they see you holding the deer cookies that you buy for around a hundred and fifty yen from the local vendors.

they are everywhere so as you go from monument to shrine to Temple you will run into them.","Written August 8, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Lovely Park and allows up close with Deer,"Firstly do note the deer are wild, they are not in any form of captivity so there is no fear of mistreatment or them being forced to be there.
That being said they are looked after well due to their standing in local culture and beliefs so they are taken care of.
It is amazing to get so cloase and to see them bowing for the deer biscuits. The area is lovely with loads to walk around and see, can be busy but due to the size you can just walk elsewhere and find a quieter spot.
The temples are equally worth the visit as they are really nice and vary between each one. Especially worth seeing the huge Buddha in one of them.
A really nice day out overall that creates lasting memories and is very special.",
Japan,Nara Park,So many deer :),"We went to Nara park in July. It was hot and cloudy. Deer poo everywhere but fairly easy to avoid because it wasn’t raining. 10 deer cookies are 150 yen and I bought 4. There deer are friendly, just don’t annoy them or make sudden movements. Also the deer are hungry and more aggressive in the morning. We went went by about 1pm many were sitting under trees and not really chasing you for cookies.",
Japan,Nara Park,Bowing Deer of Nara,"A short walk out from the train station, the deer are walking around, sitting under the trees, etc. There is a small stand where 2 elderly women are selling crackers in bunches - to feed the deer. Be careful! The deer will walk over to you, a little too aggressive for me! I dropped half my crackers trying to get away from them. They tug at your clothing, push you... it's a little scary. I pushed my daughter out of the way and tried to feed them as quickly as possible, thank goodness she wasn't holding the crackers!
We walked along the path to the temple, and found other stands selling crackers, and there are less deer assembled, so feeding them is much more enjoyable. My daughter chose to feed the smaller deer, and they were so adorable! Some of them bowed every time she gave them a cracker!!! I got such good photos and videos, she LOVED IT!","Written August 6, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Magical experience,"A wonderful experience walking together with these beautiful animals that fearlessly approach and caress each other.

Japan,Nara Park,Sacred Deer are really lovely,We visited Nara Park and the Kasuga - taisha Shrine on a lovely sunny spring day. Feeding the sacred deer was cool. They are everywhere and are very friendly and a bit cheeky. Buy a few biscuits from the local vendors for about $2.00 AUD. Stand in front of a deer and the deer will bow to you prior to getting a feed. The park is manicured and has history. It’s a really nice place. The deer will give your clothes a nip if they don’t get a biscuit but they don’t hurt. The walk uphill to the shrine is pretty easy and you’ll pass stone lanterns on the way. These lanterns hold peoples wishes which they light in fire. I’d recommend this spot to visit for a few hours.,
Japan,Nara Park,Worth a visit,"Worth the trip to Nara, even if just for a day or overnight, to see the scale of deer and their quirky little personalities.

You can buy biscuits to feed the deer for 150Y and some of them become a little more impatient that you feed them at this point! They’re not afraid to nip at your clothes!

There are loads of deer in the main part of the park but actually they are also all over the park and near the shrines too. There’s a huge hill up the back of the park where they hang out too.","Written August 3, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,A truly unique experience.,"I'm not big into animals or into getting to feed them, so I won't go into that much. Although if you would like to feed the deer, you can pay like 150 Yen to get some food for them. For me, I found visiting Nara in general to be a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle I'm used to living in Tokyo. It's such a serene and calm atmosphere. The deer will bow when they'd like to be fed and if you bow back, they expect to be fed. There were some little kids who were chasing the deer around and teasing them, please don't do that. It's not only not nice to the little guys, but it's extremely annoying for other people at the park.",
Japan,Nara Park,Better to be a deer in Nara (Japan) than anywhere in Africa,"Trust me, there's a dignified way of ""feeding the deer"" in Nara. For the first time, I uploaded a short video on YouTube about ""feeding the deer in Nara RESPECTFULLY"". If you bow to the deer, they will bow back---and expect to be fed cookies. It beats throwing the cookies at the deer as most tourists were doing. It looked incongruous. By the way, it costs 150YEN for 10 deer cookies.
In Nara, the locals treasure these ""messenger of the gods"". We were blessed enough to do a 2-day safari in South Africa in 2018 and we learned that the deer is like McDonalds fast food in the African bush. So it truly IS a privilege to get so close to a deer in Nara. Am so grateful to God for this experience:)",
Japan,Nara Park,One of the most amazing experiences you can have in Japan,"This was the second visit to Nara Park for my husband and I. This time we visited in a group pf 9 family members and it was so lovely to see everyone feeding and interacting with the beautiful deer.

It's wonderful that visitors are able to purchase deer crackers (which are very cheap) knowing that they are nutritionally good for the deer and not harming them in any way, and that the proceeds of the sale help support the care and protection of the deer.

The deer were the main attraction for us, but there are many other sights to see in the park including the amazing Todaiji Temple which is also well worth visiting.",

Japan,Nara Park,Great free attraction!,"Nara park isn’t far from the station and on a hot day a lot of it is under shade. The deer are very friendly and I was happy to see that the way people were interacting with them was ethical. You can buy the crackers for 150 JPY. The deer will ‘bow’ (some just do a head nod) for a bit of biscuit. Be careful, once they know you’ve got biscuits they can get a bit Pushy!

It was lots of fun and a great low cost activity. We took he train from Kyoto, and we thought it was definitely worth the trip!",

Japan,Nara Park,A lovely Sunday experience,"Whilst staying in Kyoto for the weekend this July i decided to take the family to the Nara Deer Park.

The park is easily reached by train from Kyoto Station, we caught the JR Nara line which meant we could use our Japan Rail Pass, so no extra train tickets costs involved.

The Deer park is a short taxi or bus journey from Nara station,and there are drop off and pick up points located outside the station and by the park, which is located at the top of the hill. So if you visit on a hot day this is the most convenient way to travel rather than walking. We visited on a Sunday in July, where the temperatures reached close to 30 degrees.

You are able to purchase Deer food in the form of dry biscuits from stall holders and the biscuits cost 150yen. The deer are free roaming and you can hand feed the deer, which is a wonderful experience for all ages. Even my teenage children enjoyed feeding the deer.

The park has restrooms and water fountains for your use. There are covered picnic spots too.

If you should be in the Kyoto / Nara area then i would definately recommend a trip to see the deer. You can also combine the visit with some culture, as there are shrines to visiti within the area.","Written July 16, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Cool!,"Guess is common knowledge there are hundreds of deers walking around so I’ll try to give some tips regarding other stuff. Morning time they are hungry, so be ready to have them coming after you if you have a cookie. Don’t stop and buy cookie at the first place after the station.. there will be an infinity of deers further ahead that will be less excited about the cookie. One actually bit me because I was holding a cookie. Didn’t hurt but better if I could have avoided. Be careful about dropping plastic, a few deers died already because they ate plastic. I could clearly see the difference when going back in the afternoon after they were all fed. They were just calmly laying there chilling and was much easier to pet and take a pic.",
Japan,Nara Park,Oh Deer!,"Nara Park is highly instagrammed for its closeness to wildlife...really it’s known as Deer Park since everywhere you look are deer!

I was excited when we got there and immediately bought a small pack of cookies to feed them. Perhaps it is wise to think out where and when to open the cracker pack because THEY KNOW! Immediately they started to follow and at first it was funny, but some of the deer can be aggressive and one nipped my bum 😑 so just note, these deer are wildlife so do be careful. It is cool how some of the deer are “polite” and know to bow to you to ask for a cracker. It’s quite a cool trick!

Also note, with so many deer = a lot of deer poo. I was there on a rainy day...so you can imagine how crazy it could be dodging parts of the ground...

Overall, I’m glad I got the insta pic, but I wouldn’t go out of my way for it if I were to do it again!",
Japan,Nara Park,Novelty deer experience,I am not sure who was pushier - tourists wanting to take pictures of deer eating or the deer wanting to eat. Nara park is one of those places that is exactly as described. A weird mixture of absolute shambles and great curiosity.The temple itself is probably the most worthwhile part of this park but it was super difficult to get to because of the crowds.,

Japan,Nara Park,Walk through the park of deer,"Easy and short walk from the train station. Unbelievable to see deer everywhere. Fun to walk around and get a few pictures. Our kids loved it. You can purchase deer cookies there for about ¥150. We chose not to because the deer are feed quite a bit. Also those who choose to feed the deer be careful as we saw people get charged by deer if they didn’t give the food right away.
For those with small children keep them close. We did see a younger child tease a deer with food then run- needless to say the deer gave the kid a good head butt and knocked the kid over ;)
We are very glad we visited. Beautiful area!",
Japan,Nara Park,"You can stroke and feed the deer, free to get in, watch out for poop! great day out for all","I went here with my daughter yesterday. It was a fantastic morning out, I would highly recommend going here. The deer were so friendly and literally ate out of your hand. The biscuits are sold at the far gate for JPY 150. Although when I bought the biscuits a small herd of deer came rushing up to me and I threw them to my daughter to take them as it freaked me out. One deer bit my daughter on the side and she also stepped in deer pooh which is to be expected. There are also limited hand washing, toilets and bins around the vicinity, take wipes and hand sanitiser. A good place to go and only a 5 to 10 minute walk from the train station with some nice eateries and shops close by.",

Japan,Nara Park,A Absolute Must,"We are headed back to Japan in September. This will be our 5th trip. We stay in Kobe when we are there but one of the absolute musts is a trip to Nara Park. It is a huge place with a number of great attractions. Primarily the park is filled with little deer that are allowed to run loose in a natural environment. They are looking for treats. The park has biscuits for sale that they love. Its really fun for kids but we love it too. After walking through the park your payoff is an immense Buddhist temple with a very large Buddha surrounded by some other statuary as well. If you are within a couple of ours from Nara Park, don't miss it.","Written July 2, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,One of the highlights of our Japan trip,"We loved Nara and Nara Park. Our 13 year old son was enamored with the deer and we loved how they bow for biscuits - amazing. Very scenic and lots of temples, gardens, and shrines to visit. We spent almost a full day here with a private guide and had an amazing time despite frequent downpours. Highly, highly recommended.",
Japan,Nara Park,Once in a lifetime deer experience,"This beautiful park nestled amongst magical temples on a shady hillside is full of sacred deer , around 1200 of them. They are wild and roam around freely . It is possible to have a truly magical experience when interacting with them if you know what to do and what to avoid. The sacred temple deer have been trained to bow to people when people bow to them . It is truly a sight to behold . It is a considered a crime in Nara to feed the deer anything other than the deer biscuits on sale from vendors in the park . When you buy these biscuits the deer will come up to you and if they are in a group may surround you and try to get you to feed them . It is not a good idea to try to feed a group of deer as they jostle for attention and can bump you or even bite. It is not a good idea to be backed into a corner by a group of deer . The best way to feed them is to buy the biscuits , put them away quickly into your bag (Preferably on your back) and walk away briskly from the group of deer . Find a single deer standing on its own away from the stalls . Then bow to it. It will bow back and then you hold out your hand and feed it a biscuit . They take them from you very gently when they are on their own . Like humans deer have their own personalities and some are really gentle and some more forceful. I met some incredibly gentle deer who were so polite and bowed and let me gently stroke them once I had fed them . I let them come toward my hand to be stroked I didn’t try to pet them uninvited . I loved the experience it was truly magical and if you follow what I have described I hope you too will have a wonderful day with the deer.","Written June 27, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Fantastic Place,"Vast and sprawling it's hard to review an attraction as diverse as this. As a park it is lovely with well tended lawns and forest and the deer that roam through it are wiite something. They are tame as you like from a lifetime of being treated with food by tourists! They are a sacred animal here and have free run of the place.
Among the many highlights that you cannot miss are Kofuku Ji Temple Complex with its 5 storied pagoda, the serene Kasuga Shrine and the awesome Todai Ji and Giant Buddha Statue.
Honestly you can just enjoy a day spend wander g the place with beautiful buildings revealing themselves to you as you go.
An amazing, wonderful place.",
Japan,Nara Park,"Cool to see, but a little overrated","The Nara Park is filled with deer, hundreds of them, and I did enjoy seeing them. However, with that being said, the experience at times seemed a little intimidating to me. Of course these animals are still wild, and were aggressive multiple times towards people during my visit. I enjoyed seeing them and since I am in Japan, it was an experience I had to be a part of. Though if you’re not planning on enjoying other sights in Nara I would think twice about going. If you are brave and have no problem going up to feed and pet a wild animal, then go for it! But the experience was cute nonetheless... who doesn’t love seeing deer?!","Written June 24, 2019"

There are biscuit vendors throughout the park selling a pack for 150Y. It is advised not to feed the deer any other types of outside foods (like sweets or salty snacks).

You will encounter some deer who are very mellow; the aggressive ones will bite the biscuits from your hands, nudge you or nip at your shirt for more. A fun & cool experience.",
Japan,Nara Park,Must visit if you are in Osaka,"If you are visiting Osaka, make sure you put Nara on your itinerary. It’s very easy to get to, take a JR train will get you to Nara station, from there a short ride on bus will reach Nara park.
Quite a big park that roam with heaps of deer and you would find vendor selling snack or cracker to feed the deer, careful when u feeding them as often u would draw a lots of them to you and next thing u know is some of them bid you, and sometimes they got aggressive as well. You will need to make the hand signals of “ no more “ and they would stop harassing you.
Nara park is very beautiful all year long, you could just sit on the bench and admire the beauty of the nature once you get bored with the deer.
Walk further a bit and you would find the massive, beautiful, ancient To-Dai Ji.
There were quite a numbers of restaurant, souvenirs shops around as well to make sure you would be re-energized after the long walk or something to bring home for memories.",

The adjacent Todai-ji temple is a stone's throw away. The park is easily accessible by public transportation. Highly recommended.",

Japan,Nara Park,Deer love biscuits,"The park is a pretty nice place to stroll around and feed some bowing deer. We were expecting a small herd and smaller deer. But there are a ton of deer here and they are pretty big. Tame and calm too. And they love the biscuits. If you let them bow then give them a bit of biscuit they'll keep doing it until you run out. Biscuits are for sale by venders all over. Easy to find and about ¥150 for several. Running and screaming from the deer is not the best plan. The deer can get pushy if you tease them. They will kick and head butt. Just ignore them and put your hands away when you don't want to feed them. They will wonder away then. Its a pretty unique experience. My kids will definitely remember this. We got there early and missed a large portion of the crowds. There is several parking lots around, all were paid and the price varied depending on location.","Written June 19, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Must-see In the Kansai Region,"The day in Nara Park was my favorite day of my Japan trip. Where else in the world can you wander around feeding deer that will bow to you? Nara was very easy to get to from Osaka and was ~40 min to travel to. We didn’t have the JR Pass but you can take the local lines. Once you get there, it’s an easy walk to the Park and there is clear signage. Granted it’s very geared towards the tourists but there were quite a few schoolkids on field trips in the Park as well. You can buy the biscuits from licensed street vendors all around the park and it’s all 150 yen, so no need to try to bargain. The deer would bow but they are also pushy about getting more food if they sense weakness/think you have more food, so don’t be bullied! They might headbutt you or bite but just keep calm and walk away quickly if that does happen. To feed them, hold up the biscuit so that they see it, then bow at a 45 degree angle. Wait for them to bow back and then repeat as needed. Give them the biscuit by holding it at their mouth level, grabbing one end of the biscuit so that your hands don’t accidentally get bitten. Rinse and repeat!

The park was extremely pretty too: very green and in close proximity to all the temples. The park itself is free to enter so be respectful and don’t litter. Have fun!!","Written June 18, 2019"

Of course one has to be careful because the deers do come on their own very close to get the crackers but the miraculous part is that these are “bowing deers” .. you bow to them and they bow back! And then have the cracker ! Pretty amazing! I remember one of the deers bit me a little as I wasn’t paying attention to giving it a cracker :) so one has to be a little careful but overall a fantastic experience !

Japan,Nara Park,Well worth a visit,"Nara park is full of small deers who mingle weith the tourists in the anticiaption of being fed with deer crackers being sold there at a cost of 150 Yen. The deer are very sweet but should be trated with some respect and can get a bit ""pushy "" if they think you have some crackers in your hand. Some of them have learnt to bow to get a cracker! Tie this in with visits to Todaiji Temple, Kasuga-taisha Shinto Shrine, Kōfuku-ji or the lovely Isuien gardens. Plenty to do and see in Nara to keep you occupied!","Written June 3, 2019"
Japan,Nara Park,Watch Out for the Deer,"The main feature of the park is a heavy population of deer that have learned to beg for food and when approached right, will bow for food.

Japan,Nara Park,A wonderful mix of UNESCO world heritage and deer Kingdom.,"Park Nara boasts one of the densest concentrations of UNESCO world heritage sites in the world. There are the main sites of Nara here: Todaiji temple, Kofuku-JI temple and Kasuga Shrine. However, not that remains in the memory, and a huge number of deer, of which there are more than a thousand. They are not afraid of people and begging, which doesn`t cause no condemnation the majority of visitors . Crackers for feeding cost 150 yen. The only time deer are unsafe is during the rut - mating season. At this time males knock trees about trees, and they're dangerous to humans.They do this not because of aggressiveness or the desire to attract a female, but because hormones are produced in the horns that are responsible for puberty and the activity of the sex glands in adult life. They want to get rid of excess load quickly . The blood circulation in the horns ends at the end of the mating period and the deer rubs its horns to shed the skin. Park workers cut off the antlers with a saw. This necessary work is carried out in the autumn and furnished as a ritual. Workers dressed in traditional clothing, and horns have been portrayed God, as donations sanctuary. Tourism demands a spectacle...",
Japan,Nara Park,Nice park,"Nice park, very clean and full of deers. There are people on the streets that sells the deers crackers, I think they know and from time to time they are a little aggressive if you don't give them the cracker.","Written June 2, 2019"

They can be really pushy so do make sure that your backpack or bag is fully zipped up. One actually used it's antlers to try to unhook my bag from my shoulder! If you hold your hands up in the air above you the deer will ""bow"" which all my kids loved. Deer food can be purchased easily and cheaply from multiple stalls but don't overdo it as you may get sick of the deer a bit quicker than you expect. The Todai-Ji temple is well and truly worth the entry fee (unlike many we came across) and the grounds are beautiful.","Written June 2, 2019"

Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),The buddha is really big,"I've seen people uploading photos on the great Buddha in Kamakura a long time before I finally had the chance to visit it. With its long history, it's really surprising how well-maintain it was. so I finally ventured into Kamakura about two weeks ago and see it with my own eyes. My first impression of it was - Wow! It's really big! It looks quite sturdy, and of course it looks very good at its' age. I didn't enter the Buddha, but just the look of it from the outside is quite impressive already.

The shop in the temple sell goodies/cookies/snacks that features the Great Buddha too. Not to forget, all the good luck charms/Omamori you could get as souvenirs for friends and relatives. I'm not sure how many of the tourists who visited the place felt this way, but I felt extremely peaceful while I'm at the temple.","Written September 10, 2019"

It originally was housed in a large temple hall, but the temple buldings were destroyed many times by typhoons and tsunamis, so the Great Buddha has been out in the open air since the late 15th Century.

The Buddha has a calm countenance. We also paid a small fee to see the interior of the statue. Booths are set up nearby for shopping with religious items for sale. There is also a shop behind a wall to the left of The Buddha, that has many small souvenirs to purchase. There are also two huge sandals on a wall to the right.

Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),Stately and serene,"One of the two major sights in Kamakura, the Daibutsu is a must-see. The temple associated with this figure is Kōtoku-in, and worth taking a look at too.
As with most Japanese shrines or temples, seasonal gardens are also a major feature. We visited in late spring, so the azaleas were in full, perfumed bloom and looked glorious.
The Daibutsu itself is an incredible sight, especially on a day with clear blue skies. If you’re lucky, you might even see a kite (the bird) soaring above it. Take the time to look at the fine detail on both the Buddha and things like the incense burner in front of it. I could look into that serene face for a long time!
We took the opportunity (20 yen) to go inside the Daibutsu and climb up to see the way the structure was made. Our Japanese host chose not to. I’m not sure if this was because she was afraid of the dark, or whether she thought it was disrespectful. I felt uncomfortable doing so as a result, but I suppose if it was truly disrespectful the temple officials wouldn’t allow it, would they?",

Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),It's a big Buddha,"The temple is most famous for the big Buddha at the centre of it. It's humongous, but not as big as the one in Todai Ji. Nor is it made of Bronze. Overall, this one loses in comparison to the temple in Nara, but it gets points for trying. Not everything can be number one, but this can be number two. Besides that, there isn't actually that much to do here. I tried to get a goshuin here, but the shop closed early for some reason.

Originally, it was enclosed in a large wooden structure that was destroyed by typhoons, and tidal damage (1369 and 1495). It remains now exposed to the weather and has stood the test of time. This image is the second largest in Japan with a sitting height of 11.3 meters. Nara has the largest statue housed in the Toodaiji Temple.

Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),Come before closing...,"The great Buddha Kamakura (in Japanese Kamakura Daibutsu) is the main attraction for which tourists go to Kamakura. The 13-meter statue is the second tall bronze Buddha of Japan after the champion at Todaiji temple in Nara. We visited the bronze Buddha champion in Nara a week after his fellow in Kamakura. Here it is necessary to emphasize that we are talking about bronze Buddhas. Kamakura Daibutsu is very far from the Japanese champion, the third highest Buddha in the world, 120-meter stone Daibutsu in the city of Usiku. But Ushiku Daibutsu is uninteresting remake of 1993 and the Kamakura Daibutsu is the history. Presumably 1252. That time the capital of Japan was moved here from Kyoto to a century and a half. As the Daibutsu of Nara, the Kamakura Buddha used to sit inside the temple. However, Kamakura unlike Nara is a coastal town and the walls of temple were washed into the sea,by tsunami in 1498. Buddha of Kamakura is now breathing in the sea air. Fortunately the beach is 700 meters in a straight line. Buddha, which we see, by the way, is not a wooden original, but a bronze remake. It may not even be the first one. As you know, the samurai Kamakura did not keep the design documentation...The bronze Buddha is hollow inside, which is indicated by a hole in the back. It`s possible go inside for little money (20 yen). However, we came under the closure and ride with viewing the hollow inside of the Buddha has ended. The pre-closure visit resulted in a relatively small number of tourists. A big plus for today's times.",

Its a worthy stop to take while in Kamakura, and within walking distance from the center if you don't mind a few more strides.","Written April 8, 2019"
Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),Amazing!!,A must if you visit Japan. Huge Buddha statue surrounded by a beautiful garden. You can enter the statue to see how it was built. Arrive early in the morning to avoid crowds.,
Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),It's Big,"It's very big and very old. Impressive that they could build it so big back in the day before power tools.

You can photo it for Instagram and maybe offer a prayer or meditate. But that's it - nothing else needed.",
Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),Just astounding... you will be amazed this was constructed over 750 years ago.,"There are so many temples and cultural sites to visit in Japan, this was one of the best we saw.

Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),The main reason for visiting Kamakura,"Even at about 10am there were quite a few people here (not too crowded), but the Great Buddha is worth visiting. It's not the biggest I've seen (I have been to the one in Hong Kong) but it's certainly the oldest. It was constructed in the 13th century and has outlasted every building put up around it. Very impressive.

Admission is 200 yen. If you want to go inside the Daibutsu (it's hollow), that's 20 yen and I frankly think it's worth it at that price.","Written March 19, 2019"

Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),One for the bucket list ticked off.,Since my mother came here when she travelled to Japan in the 1960’s I’ve always had a fascination of the Buddha of Kamakura. Well today I can tick it off my bucket list. The place is magical and very peaceful. I was lucky as there wasn’t many people here. The statue is enormous but the setting is beautiful. I was even impressed that I was able to go inside and the inside of the statue. I am grateful in seeing this.,
Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),The 3rd largest bronze Buddha statue,"The bronze Buddha of Kotoku-in is the 3rd largest Buddha statue in Japan. Based on history, the statue was originally house within a temple. However, several temple fires have destroyed the buildings, eventually it was decided that the Buddha statue be left outdoors.

An admission ticket will be required to enter the temple grounds, additional fees is required should you wish to enter the Buddha statue. The statue itself is magnificent and the garden that surrounds it gives a very Zen feeling of the place. Please arrive at the temple early should you want to avoid the never-ending crowds at this attraction.

PS: Other than the bronze Buddha statue, there is nothing much in my opninon around the temple grounds.
There's a shrine behind the statue, a gift shop and a small tea house.",

Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),Less is More Part 362 - Big Beautiful Bold Bronze,"Quite unbelievable that the Daibutsu at the Kotoku-in in Kamakura is nearly 800 years old! It has aged very well. Although neither the largest nor tallest, it is evidently the most famous and iconic - something to do with the proportions, the expression or serene natural setting OR ALL THREE. Interesting to find out that it was originally housed indoors but those structures sheltering it were repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes and floods over the years. The last one was in 1498 and since then the statue has stood outdoors.

A visit does does not take very long since it is actually quite a small place. Getting in costs much less than parking for an hour nearby (200¥ vs. 800¥). For a mere 20¥ more, you can get inside the statue. It’s a novelty since there’s hardly anything to see inside. On a chilly wintry morning, the crowds are thin. Not much has changed since our last visit 30 years ago, except the touristy souvenirs have become more tacky. Daibutsu lollipops? Daibutsu snow globes? Daibutsu cartoon key chains? Daibutsu socks anyone?",
Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),Just Beautiful,"Looking at pictures of this place doesn’t do it justice to how seeing it in person feels. There is also a walkway around the side and the foliage is nice to stop and appreciate as well.

Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),Not Just A Big Buddah!,"First of all, DON'T book yourself onto one of the expensive Kamakura day tours - it is easily accessible from Tokyo (took me about an hour on the train from Asakusa area) and Hasedera and Kotoku-in (Big Buddha) are within 10 minutes walk of Hase train station, and you can't go wrong, just head up the main road from the station - Hasedera is on the left, Kotoku-in on the right a little further up. The cost to enter both are minimal (I think about 300 yen), and the return train trip about 2000 yen, so you will save yourself an absolute FORTUNE doing this under your own steam, unless, of course, you are desperate for the minimal history a tour guide gives you that is easily found on the internet!

The Buddha is impressive, but this shrine has more to offer including some architecture and plants/trees that are quite beautiful! Not worth coming to Kamakura just for this one thing, though, as you only need about an hour, so team it up with one or two other good sites like Hasedera and the beach! There are also many little shops and cafes lining the main road that are well worth a look!","Written February 13, 2019"
Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),Great Buddha of Kamakura,The Great Buddha of Kamakura was indeed great. It was a long trip by train and a bus ride but I’m so glad we went to see him. You can actually go inside the Buddha but we did not because it was very warm outside and the line was very long. They have a place you can buy charms or other things like prayer beads. There’s not a lot to do right around him but that’s ok because he was magnificent. On your way back to your bus stop there are little shops lining the streets that you can pick up anything from souvenirs to a brand new knife set. A short bus ride back to Kamakura station gives you plenty of food options.,

What ended up being really special for my husband and I was we stumbled into a massive group of school children who were delighted to see us- and wanted to practice their English because they had an assignment. Haha. Obviously this won’t happen every time but if you do wander in and see a sea of little yellow hats- be ready to answer “what Japanese food do you enjoy?” At least 30 times! We loved it.,

My beautiful bride and I went on a very, very hot summer day, but he feel of the grounds and the peaceful energy made it seem like a very pleasant day.

Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),Okay Monument but the surroundings are quite exquisite,"We had heard a lot about the ""Great Buddha Statute"" of Kamakura and were naturally excited to visit the same. However, as we reached the site, we were a bit disappointed by its appearance both on the outside and in the inside. But to be fair to the Statue, we believe it was destroyed a few times before being repaired and once could easily notice the repair work.

The interesting aspect of this Buddha is that we can walk inside the Statue and watch how the Great Buddha was built/cast. It is a very small climb to the top of the Statue.

The location of the Buddha and the surroundings in and around the Statue is picture perfect and is worth spending some time around it. We walked around for about 30 minutes and enjoyed the natural beauty that surrounded this Giant Statue.","Written August 3, 2018"
Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),Absolutely Beautiful Great Buddha,"We took the train from Yokohama, which took less than 45 minutes in total, to see the Daibutsu (Great Buddha of Kamakura. From the train/tram station called Hase, it is a 10 minute walk up the street to reach this serene site. The entrance cost is ¥200 and for an additional ¥20 at the rear base of the Buddha you can go inside the brass statue. The statue is absolutely beautiful and the grounds so serene. Although it is the second largest Buddha statue in Japan, it is the largest outdoor Bronze Buddha Statue. The Great Buddha was originally housed in a temple, however the temple was destroyed in a tsunami in the 1500s. If you would like to explore the inside of the statue there is a narrow staircase of no more than 10 steps to climb to be be inside. There are 2 windows located on the statue’s upper back to allow for air flow as it is very contained inside and on a hot day EXTREMELY hot and stuffy. Not really much to see inside but for ¥20 (about 20 cents) I am glad I took a quick peak. At one time you were able to look out the Buddha’s eyes but now you are at the level of his knees and no higher. Those with mobility issues I would not recommend the inside as the stairs are narrow and somewhat steep.
There are 2 shops on site that souvenirs can be purchased as well as ice cold beverages in vending machines. There are also washrooms available.",

With a small fee, you can take the steep stairs inside the Buddha and explore the working inside. Kind of interesting to be inside of the statue.

Built in 1252 (took TEN years) it is imposing and beautiful. I have been here twice. Once there were NO people and one time JAM PACKED on the weekend. So if you can visit on a week day maybe that is better. :)",
Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),Amazing to see in person,"After many trips to Japan, this was my first time to go to Kamakura to see Buddha. Although not as big as the Buddha at Todaiji in Nara, this Buddha is still impressive. There are hoardes of tourists but that is to be expected at all of the famous temples and sites in Japan. Looking at Buddha up close is remarkably calming, and the 20 Yen fee to go inside is worth it just so you can say that you actually went inside!

To get there, the short way is to take the JR to Kamakura station, buy a ticket on Enoden (a somewhat rickety electric train that costs 190 Y) and get off 3 stops later at Hase station. Side note: you can go directly to Kamakura from Shinjuku in about 45 minutes. When you get off, you cross the tracks and walk 8 minutes on a little side street that has a bunch of cute shops and cafes. You will not see a hint of Buddha until you arrive at the entrance, pay the 200 Yen, and turn the corner. Then you see Buddha and it hits you that you are actuallyin Koutokuin! I loved that Buddha is hidden from view from the street until you are in front of the statue. Equally impressive is the fact that the statue is from 1252.

If you prefer more exercise and a longer path, you can do what we did and get off at Kita Kamakura station. Right next to this station is Enkakuji, which is a sprawling temple complex that is worth the 400 Yen. You can meander around the peaceful grounds for the better part of an hour, and don't miss the bell that was put there in 1301 at the top of the stairs. It's quite a climb up but great exercise. After Enkakuji, there are at least 4 more temples on the 1.5 km walk to Kamakura. This was quite a hike along a windy road lined with nice, leafy green trees, but I wouldn't want to do this if it were 90 degrees. There is not much to see until you start seeing all of the tour buses, tourists, and kids on field trips, when you know you are getting close. When the road curves to the left for the last time and you see the big red torii gate, you will be plopped in the middle of what seems like every tourist in Japan. This torii is the front of Tsurugaoka Hachimangu. It was breathtaking to see in the distance. You are now at the main street of Kamakura and there are probably a thousand restaurants and shops on this and the neighboring streets. It was very busy and very touristy.

Hint: If you are pressed for time or don't want a really long walk, I would get off at Kamakura station, go up the street to the left to Hachimangu, walk around, eat, go back to the train station, take the Enoden to Hase station and the Great Buddha, and then take the Enoden back to Kamakura station and then back to Tokyo. This is more than enough walking and shopping for the day!","Written May 4, 2018"

Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),Large Scale Buddha,"We were already in Kamakura and visited the Great Buddha in the Kotoku-in Temple. Lots of people were there - cherry blossom season and of course the main attraction, the Great Buddha. It's certainly a large casting of Buddha - weighing in at 120+ tons and is 11+ metres high.

Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),Main attraction in Kamakura and lived up to the reputation,"Kamakura is really a perfect day trip from Tokyo. The JR Yokosuka Line connects Tokyo Station directly with Kamakura Station. The one way trip takes just under an hour and costs 920 yen.

From the Kamakura Station, stop in the visitor's center to get some maps and direction. Then catch the Enoden railway, 3 stops to Hase Station. There are a number of sights to visit.

The Great Buddha is impressive. It is the second tallest bronze Buddha statue in Japan. The cherry blossoms were in full bloom, photographing the Buddha with the blossoms was easy and beautiful. Even though there were lots of tourists, it was still a nice visit. You can walk right up to the Buddha's base for a good 360 degrees viewing.","Written April 14, 2018"
Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),Great Buddha,Our main destination in Kamakura is the Great Buddha in the Kotokuin temple. We travelled to Kamakura from Shinjuku using the Kamakura Pass offer from Odakyu train. We get return train ticket from Shinjuku to Fujisawa near Kamakura and unlimited ride on Odakyu and Enoden trains around Kamakura and Enoshima. I think the package is worth it for a day trip from Tokyo. We got off at Fujisawa station and change to Enoden Line until Hase station. From there it's a 10 minute walk to the Great Buddha statue. It was spring time and the sakura tree were blooming at that time. We can also enter the inner part of the statue but the line was long so we skipped it. After taking some pictures we moved on to other temples in Kamakura.,"Written April 13, 2018"

Japan,Kotoku-in (Great Buddha of Kamakura),Magnificent Great Buddha,A trip to Kamakura is never complete without a visit to the Great Buddha. We took a cab from Kamakura Station there for about 1000¥. There are some Sakura trees in the compound and that makes it a beautiful setting for phototaking.

Once arriving at the train station we grabbed some breakfast (pastries and quiche) at Deli France, yummm! We then walked to the park to see the Great Buddha, arriving around 8:30 a.m. Arriving early allowed us to get some great pictures and afforded us some peaceful time in the beautiful surroundings. We then made our way back to town (a short walk) and visited the shops. For lunch, we decided to go off the beaten path for a little food at a place called Hideyoshi, a Yakitori spot. It was delicious! The day trip was a nice get-a-way from the bustling city and allowed us to recharge our batteries. :)",

This bridge is absolutely incredible and the whole island is gorgeous. There is a large parking lot at the base of the bridge for photos and viewing the Sea. Mid way through the bridge is a small pull off area. The bridge is absolutely gorgeous with the turquoise waters. The island hosts many attractions including a lighthouse, shrines, beaches, and hiking. This place does get crowded during peak tourist seasons, so come prepared.

Japan,Tsunoshima Ohashi,"A place with a view, worth to visit","I came from Shimonoseki station, hence it was a bit difficult in terms of transportation (JR train ride) and then bus to the nearest station to the bridge. Please check which station your are coming from. Coming from Shimonoseki station, you can either Kottoi station or Takibe station, then wait for the blue bus that will take you to the brigde (that is the entrance of Hotel Nishinnagato Resort, then walk about 2 minutes to the bridge to take picture. And I was lucky to go around the sunset hours, though the bus ride is almost the finale ride.
For example, I took 13.44 ride with JR train from Shimonoseki station), arriving to Takibe station at 14.59, And then blue bus at 16.21 arriving at Hotel Nishinagato resort entrance at 16.53. And I had about 30 mins in total to take picture and enjoy sceneries there.And at 17.26 I was back at the bus stop, to go back to Kottoi station (you can also stop at Kottoi station and take a JR train ride to Takibe station-but please check the time table), arrived at Takibe station took JR train from at the station at 18.22, arrived to Shimonoseki station at 19.31. But please take note that this blue bus actually does cross the bridge to go over to Tsunoshima island, but you must make sure you have enough time to walk and explore around, and please check the time table in advance. Bus services are not that frequent, and if you have 4 people, you may charter a taxi, the station master is able to help you. A single way taxi ride might cost JY5000.","Written November 3, 2019"

It is quite remote area and maybe still not popular for foreigner traveller. However if you have a plenty of time, it is recommended place to visit it since the scenery is very beautiful. The best time to visit it is during the summer time so you can enjoy its beach.",
Japan,Tsunoshima Ohashi,Tsunoshima Bridge is famous for the beauty of its vicinity,"Tsunoshima Bridge and its vicinity have a super-wonderful scenery because of the white sand on the beach. Nobody would expect this light blue color in the sea along the northern coast of the Japan Sea. In summer, staying at a hotel near the bridge can be a wonderful holiday as you can enjoy the white sandy beach near the bridge.",
Japan,Tsunoshima Ohashi,The real Japanese Roadtrip!,"Whilst it may seem out of the way, have no doubt the drive in itself is just as enjoyable as the bridge.

With Motonosumi Inari Shrine only about half an hour away, along with a Roadside Station selling foods such as Yakitori, Grilled Squid, Takoyaki alongside standard souveniers and the region's local foods, you'd almost forget there was a bridge if the name wasn't printed everywhere.

There is parking before and after the bridge for people to take photos, alongside vending machines (Duh it's Japan), and some shops selling ice-creams and drinks. The drive itself is amazing, with the island that it leads to being equally as amazing. The bridge itself is a lot longer than you think, maybe taking about 5 minutes to cross from start to finish with various slopes and mini islands being passed.

Don't think I saw a single non-local tourist there, so if you want a unique experience, slightly off the beaten track, make sure you give this place a visit, especially the Roadside Station for food and gifts!",
Japan,Tsunoshima Ohashi,A great cycling experience,We cycled along Nagato coast and went to Tsunoshima via this long bridge.

Japan,Tsunoshima Ohashi,"Blue ocean, fishing boats, great view","We just happen to drive by the area and decided to cross the bridge. That was a great decision. The sky had quick moving clouds, so the ocean changed its color from gray to blue in a few minutes we were around. We could also see some fishing boats and fishermen busying themselves. The beautiful clear water under the bridge was flowing from one side to the other in an amazingly fast speed. Crossing the bridge is quick, but there is a small parking in the middle of the bridge as well as on the island side of the bride, where you can park your car safely and enjoy the view to your heart's content.

Otherwise you can take the elevator down into the sea cave and watch the waves crash in. The elevator is expensive.
We didn't bother but enjoyed the trail down to the cliffs instead.
There is a small park with shrines just before the cliffs where you can rest in the shade on a bench and eat your packed lunch.

Japan,Jogasaki Coast,Magnificent Mother Nature !,"I was not meant to be here. I was chasing Hanami which landed me up at Izukogen station. Then I used TA to search the attractions nearby & found Jogasaki Coast. After Mt Omuro, I got lost & ended up at Ito. So, when a JR pass, I came back to Izukogen station and took a local bus to Jogasaki Coast. It was about 15:00 hours. But since I am in the vicinity, it made sense to spend time with Mother Nature.

To me, this coastal walk is even better than visiting Mt Omuro.
From the Kaiyo Koen Bus Stop, I took a hike along the jagged coastal line to Kadowaki Cape Lighthouse & Hanshiro Otoshi Suspension Bridge. The view was awesame and the air was so fresh. I saw pine trees, wild flowers, the expanse of the sea and powerful waves crashing onto the rocks.
I took my time to soak it all it. So spiritual.

The suspension bridge is not at all scary. When you look down, you can see the powerful waves. When you look out, you see the deep blue ocean.

Well, at the end of the trail, I ended up at Kadowaki carpark, and u can see dusk is round the corner. There was a taxi waiting. I didn't to risk waiting for the infrequent bus. So I hopped on to the taxi who brought me back to the Izukogen station for JPY1660. It was metered. But the aged driver must have done this route so many times that he can tell me the exact fare.

It was good. Spending time with Nature and letting an elderly driver earn some cab-fare.",
Japan,Jogasaki Coast,Tough walk but worth it,"This is a great nature hike, totally worth it if you're in the area and the weather's good.

There's actually two distinct sections to the walk. If you start at Jogasaki-Kaigan station it takes about 10-15 minutes walk along the road to reach the northern area, with a lighthouse and impressive suspension bridge. There's a cafe and carpark, and the walkways are mostly paved so good for kids or elderly. This area's nice and easy.

South of Izukaiyo Park things get a bit more rugged. The narrow trails wind up and down between the outcrops and it's largely rough stone steps. It's great for nature spotting - snakes, lizards, cats, spiders. Some of the geological formations are amazing too. It's about 5-6km from the park to the southern suspension bridge (took me just over an hour at a good speed) and it's pretty tiring by the end. You'll want hiking boots and a good supply of water.

At the southern end is another suspension bridge, some waterfalls and some tidal pools (which are accessible by some pretty steep stone steps). There's a car park at the south so you could just drive and miss out on the trek in the middle!

If you're walking south it's easy to get lost near the Renchaku-ji temple. It feels like you should follow the path to the sea which is actually a dive launch area. Instead follow the steep road up into the temple grounds and across.

Also look for the amazing ramen shop opposite Nagaya supermarket if you head back through Izukogen station.",
Japan,Jogasaki Coast,Must see,"We stayed on the jogasaki coast and it is beautiful. You must do the two suspension bridge 10k hike but it is not for beginners or those with mobility issues. Some parts are quite steep, the path is overgrown and the terrain is uneven. It's a fabulous hike if you're able. From Jogasaki there is a car park and vending machines with water etc but there's nothing from about the end of the first mile so bear that in mind. If you end in Izu-Kogen there's loads of nice places for lunch.","Written September 12, 2017"
Japan,Jogasaki Coast,A must-visited place when you visit Ito,"The place was great. No entrance fee. You just need to pay ¥500 for the parking lot. You have to prepare for a long walk, though coz the trail is pretty long. There is a small swimming pool at the end of the trail but it's not for free. I love the rocks the best.",

Japan,Jogasaki Coast,Nice hiking,"Arrived around 15:00, we parked our vehicle near the flower garden, and it is a 1km walk alone the shoreline to the light tower and the suspension bridge.

The path is beautifully paved, mixed into the nature and yet easy to walk. The view along the way is magnificent. When you are on the bridge, the view is even better. If you are scare of height, you still should give this a try as the view is breath taking.

On the way back, there is another path you can choose, 300 meter less to walk but the path is filled with stones.

All done in an hour. One of the best view one would never forget.

Japan,Jogasaki Coast,What an amazing place!,"So it isn't really a beach- more a hike/walk along amazingly scenic rocky coastline.

We went on a misty rainy day and it couldn't have been more perfect. The water is so blue and clear. The waves are so fantastic crashing against the coastline. The plants are so lush and green. We started at the lighthouse and suspension bridge and walked about 1.5 km which took us to gardens with food and toilet facilities. There is another coast line walk that starts there for about 8 km to another suspension bridge but we were short on time. If we had a full day we would have definitely done it.

We took the train to Jogasaki station. From there it is a little confusing - supposedly there is a bus you could take but we walked. It was about 20 min walk to the bridge and it was 100% gps guided (there are no signs!). Walk back was about the same from the gardens.

The cable bridge is one of the most exciting spot of this park. People who afraid of height (like my wife) will keep screaming when crossing the bridge. Very fun and exciting , whoever came to this park, must go to this bridge to test your guts.

Japan,Jogasaki Coast,4.2/5... a very nice walk and a cool suspension bridge.,"It was a cloudy day, but the sun was trying to poke through. We were a group of seven....22 to 77 years old. The walk was doable and nobody complained. We could see incredible rock formations....volcanic. It is a short walk from Izu Kogen station (1km). There is a cave with a small shrine in it that some of the locals showed us. The clarity of the water was awesome. Although a bit steep at points, the trail was easy to walk on. We came to a suspension bridge and spent a few minutes looking off of it. The view was great. After that, at a rest area with benches, some of us took the path down to the rocks below. Fishermen were perched upon the jagged rocks, waves crashing in, trying to catch their dinner. I heard there were plenty of fish that thrive in the clear, fertile waters. You can then cut up to the station, or take a longer route which is about 5 km longer. Good for everyone, and a lovely way to see some rocky cliffs along the ocean formed by volcanic activity. Enjoy, but don't wear high heels....like some woman we saw on the trail was wearing.
PS: English description are all over the trail. Learned a lot about it. So really, enjoy!",
Japan,Jogasaki Coast,Picturesque,"Definitely worth the visit. Try to come early or later in the day for better lighting for picture taking. If you come later in the day, in late fall/winter, do allocate some time to make it back to the parking lot in time before it gets dark on the trail paths. The sun goes down quite fast in winter around 3:30 or 4pm. Could easily be disoriented in the dark and under thick vegetation. The suspension bridge was closed for repair at time of visit.",

I arrived at the stop which I was not too confident whether I have had alight correctly? I did not see any clear signage, however based on gut feel I just go along till I sense that I should be on the right track!

You will be all alone in the hiking trail (hardly anyone goes there on a weekday but that is good, I dislike touristy places) but your eyes are spoilt with beautiful scenes of Pacific Ocean that is not blocked by any architectural buildings, trees of all shapes and sizes especially beautiful pine trees and seasonal plants, insects and animals (if you could stop and observe), lava rock formations...

seeing the waves crashing can be quite therapeutic to some...

It has so much to offer ONLY if your heart is as vast as the ocean

You can sign up for kayaking,fishing or diving etc if time allows, or do a ferry-tour if you prefer not to walk.

While it is quite challenging (including climbing lighthouse for me to complete the hike within a span before the next bus will arrive

The Jogasaki coast is accessible via 1.6 km walk from the Jogasaki-kaigen train station, which is lined with cherry trees and would be a treat for visitors during May.

Japan,Jogasaki Coast,"Should be titled ""Jogasaki coast,"" and it's spectacular.","There is access to a tide pool at one point, but it's definitely ""user beware""--there are rogue waves even at low tide. That said, it's an absolutely stunning coastal path. Some parts are fairly easy (usually close to access points near the train stations) while others are more challenging. There are spots where waves ""boom"" up through holes, there are slot canyons running to the sea, there's a waterfall, and there's a region of basalt columns, rather like the famous Irish Giant's Causeway. We've been here twice, and (along with the diving, which is much better than it's given credit for) this was our reason for returning. This year's photos are from a rainy day, but it's great, sun or rain. To do the whole thing safely and enjoy it, you'd need most of a day (there are a couple of spots with bathrooms, so it's doable). However, you can get to very nice bits within 20 minutes, and enjoy them reasonably in an hour or two. We did three separate walks of 2-4 hours each.",

Jogasaki Coast is a 30min walk from Jogasaki-kaigan Station. Several sakura trees line up the streets going towards the coast.

Japan,Jogasaki Coast,Trail with good ocean view,"Like the highway I in California, the beach provides a walking trail to get close encounter of the ocean, beautiful scenic trail. Easy to handle and great for families to have fun time and lovers to make vows before the nature.","Written April 24, 2015"
Japan,Jogasaki Coast,Very Beautiful,"Very easy ""hike"" which some women did in heals though I wouldn't recommend that. You can do it in less than one hour or take your time checking out lava rock formations and spend a few hours at it. I went over a holiday weekend and it was packed, although all the tourists were Japanese, so I didn't mind! Felt like I did a ""local holiday weekend"".","Written December 29, 2014"

Japan,Jogasaki Coast,"Traditional neighborhoods, ocean views, great walking.","It's a pleasant walk down to the sea from the Izu-Kogen area, and the seaside is cooler on hot days. From the harbor area leads a trail that follows the seaside which can be shortened in many places or followed all the way to the Futo train station which will take you back to Izukogen Station for less than $3 U.S. A decent map of the area is available in Japanese and English at hotels and train information offices. One caution about the maps: there are lots more streets in the area than show up on the tourist guide map, so travel with care ... and a compass or GPS. If you're ever totally lost, flag down a taxi and they'll take care of you.","Written October 29, 2014"
Japan,Jogasaki Coast,Nice nature walk,"This is a nice, easy 3km hike along the coastline on tree covered trail. You get to enjoy the lava formations and beautiful view of the ocean and cliffs.
Perfect for a day trip from Ito taking the buses offered with the 'Free Ito Pass'.",
Japan,Jogasaki Coast,A beautiful and easy walk,It's a great walk on a cliff above the ocean. There's an old string bridge in the middle of the path that is a sort of an attraction. One can go back after arriving to the bridge or go a little further where the path ends and takes you back to the road.,"Written May 27, 2012"
