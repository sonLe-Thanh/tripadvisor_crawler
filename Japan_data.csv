Japan,Universal Studios Japan,No repairs for Harry Potter wand,"One Star to get attention. We bought a Harry Potter interactive wand and shortly after buying it it stopped working. We read online that that Orlando and Hollywood Universal Studios will repair a broken wand no questions asked, so we took it back to the shop. However they refused and claimed once sold they will not accept returns or do repairs. The interactive wand is expensive since the point of it is less of the wand itself and more of paying so that you can interact with the magical surroundings. Needless to say this was disappointing and I don't understand why the Japan location would have a different policy than its US counterparts.","Written June 14, 2021"

Japan is one of the countries of art. The architectural relics from Tokyo to Osaka bring out the Japanese style. The local aspect focuses on the beautiful appearance. The dazzling gold and the differences also bring out the distinctive urban architecture. More regularity and prosperity The other side of Japan.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,値段が高い,too expensive and nothing special。i had to throw in the rubbish my bentou and i had to buy the expensive food of the park. This is crazy!,"Written April 5, 2021"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"smaller than the US counterparts, great experience, and good food.","Love USJ! There's something they do different than other parks. All the staff is very kind and the merchandise is quite unique to this location. Recommend for friends, family, and must ride the dinosaur coaster.","Written February 21, 2021"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great Place!,"We went to USJ without purchasing any tickets beforehand, it took us less than 5 mins to purchase tickets. We went last Oct 2019 (not 2020), it was Halloween season. The theme of the place was halloween inspired. The lights, decorations, even Hello Kitty was dressed in a sppoky outfit, at night zombies will chase you,

Side note: Don't bring outside food because our food got confiscated at the entrance :(",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Once is e ought.,"I buy the annual pass each year and I wonder why. You go 3 times, it becomes cost effective. I never want to go more than that in one year.","Written November 18, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Express Pass Recommended,"We bought our tickets through KKday for easy access via QRCode E-Ticket while we purchased our Express Passes direct from USJ's website as it was cheaper compared to packages sold from agencies. However, do note that the whole web page is in Japanese and would require and account and translation to complete the transaction.

Definitely a whole day or two would be required to complete all the attractions in the park with an express pass. We were in the park from opening till closing and although we purchased the Express 7, we did not get to complete 4-5 main attractions due to the queue.

We queued 90-105min for The Flying Dinosaur hence, it would be best to plan accordingly to fully utilized the time spent. Main attractions to visit would be The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Jurassic Park, Minion Park and Hollywood the Ride! Terminator 2 3-D attraction was presented in Japanese only to our dismay hence, we got bored halfway through it.

Would definitely come back again to experience Super Nintendo World in 2021! :D",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Super full day at Universal Studios Japan osaka,"This was for my sons 10th birthday and my wife is also a pretty big Harry Potter fan. So the The Wizarding World of Harry Potter was the main reason that we went but there was plenty of other things to do and see. The rides we enjoyed were:
Despicable Me Minion Mayhem, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey and Flight of the Hippogriff and Jurassic Park the ride (the last 2 were actual roller coaster rides, the other were 3D/4D rides). All of there were lots of fun but I prefer the actual rides to the 3D/4D rides. Make sure you get some Butterbeer - it tastes awesome. Also another tip is to go early or late for lunch as there can be a bit of a wait (also depending on where you go it can be a little expensive) Over all a fun filled, exhausting day that the whole family enjoyed",

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,They won't let you bring in water.,"Knowing how incredibly annoying japanese people can get when it comes to dumbly applying rules, I read them carefully in both English and Japanese the day before going to avoid any problem.
Alas, they still managed to find something to nitpick about in my bag : my bottle of water, which apparently was oversized (no joke -,-). So they took it and thanks to them I got a heatstroke.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Everyone was very Friendly,"We live in Kansai and were able to visit in July 2020 during the restricted entry for local residents. We went on a weekday and there were no lines or large crowds. Everyone of the USJ staff was very happy and friendly. It was remarkable and added to the fun experience. **TIP** Download the USJ app on Android or iPhone. The map feature is excellent, you can save favorites and there is real-time information about wait times for the attractions. The Harry Potter Journey was incredible. It did make me dizzy and nauseous afterwords however.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Loved Every Corner of USJ,"My favorite part of my experience is the Harry Potter ride experience. but i think, every part that i visited i have enjoyed a lot. i got back being a kid again hahaha.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,USJ is really fantastic!,"There are various zones such as Harry Poter, Minion, Spider-Man, Jaws and Jurassic Park, and there are so many rides available for various age groups. The most interesting ride for me was The Flying dinosaur, but the waiting line was really long, so I was sad. If you buy Express Pass, you don't have to line up, but it's expensive. Therefore, To wait less I recommend waiting in one person line even if you have a party. And I recommend you to go for popular attractions like Harry Potter first. It was so much fun that I wanted to go to osaka every time. If you go to Osaka, please go to Universal Studios:)","Written May 28, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,So much fun,"I went there in the late Morning and i spent the whole day there as its fun. There are different sections for different ages like the harry potter rides , the minion rides etc.","Written May 6, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"In between Hollywood and Orlando, but the lines are INSANE","We’re frequent visitors to the Hollywood and Orlando Universal Studios locations, and I would rank Osaka below Orlando and well above Hollywood.

As is the case with everywhere in Japan, the Osaka universal studios is extremely clean. The rides are solid to great, with the highlights being Flying Dinosaur and the Hollywood Dream ride. As a huge theme park fan, I can say unequivocally that the Flying Dinosaur is one of my favorite rides of all time. The Hollywood Dream ride isn’t a majorly thrilling rollercoaster, though it’s definitely fun and a really smooth ride.

Keep in mind, the lines for most rides are absolutely freaking ridiculous. There was a temporary VR Neon Genesis ride while we were there (it was mediocre, though I guess if you’re a fan of the cartoon then it would be cool), and the wait was almost four hours long.

As such, I HIGHLY suggest getting an Express pass. Be aware that it’s different than the pass at Universal Studios Hollywood, as you’re only able to choose between several bundles of rides whose lines you can cut. That said, it’s absolutely worth it and pretty much required if you want to ride more than a few rides.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Did not get through a lot with our kids in wet weather. Ok visit.,"On a weekday, took almost 5 & 7 year olds, arriving at 11amish. Bought tix at gate (had trouble online) which was quick (5 mins) and left the park at 7pm. Regretted not buying the express passes (for 3/5 rides) as we spent 45 mins + waiting for most rides and zig zagged the park a fair bit to try catch events at the times they were on.
Missed out on a fair bit even though we had a plan.
It also began to rain from around 3pm and never stopped so the fireworks and parade were cancelled with nothing to replace either except for a few actors (maybe 6) dressed in colourful outfits standing in a line waving at visitors. This is completely underwhelming and needs improvement.

The Cool Japan shows/attractions had a decent area and close to park entry but we didn’t visit as we had other priorities for our kids age interest.

Harry Potter land is amazing and looks so magical. Didn’t have timed entry in mid March. A definite highlight even though our kids haven’t yet read or watched any. Magical Nights light show was great. The Wand Studies was a waste of time unless you have it to waste and was definitely a cheesy push to send people through the wand shop which looked amazing but wand prices were bananas at 50 a pop.
Zipped through the castle due lack of time. Missed the ride due to long queue in rain and kids too small for roller coaster.

Kids loved the Water World performance

Sesame st 4D movie was great and the only movie we were able to catch due time/location

Minions and Spider-Man rides were excellent for all of us. Jurassic Park scared our almost 7 more than our younger kid as he hated the steep drop. Be prepared to get wet.

Disappointments:
-Queues were long for non peak time & minimal or no entertainment offered. Some shows/rides had time consuming pre show/ride sections which were just average and need reviewing
-It’s Japan so yes, Japanese is the language used but there is ample opportunity for spoken English or at least subtitles during all shows.
-Not enough characters sighted in park. Only saw about 5/6 of the Sesame St characters in the Hollywood area (I think) and that’s it! For the whole 8 hours we were there.
-Unlike Disneyland, staff do not give Universal Studio stickers out. You have to request them. Almost all have them so it’s crappy you have to ask. It’s also crappy that there are only a small selection. Disneyland nails this! and it helps keep the kids in queues a bit happier when they hand them out.
-Retail merch here was noticeably more expensive than Disney Tokyo a year prior. I expect high prices but I drew the line here as I felt it was a joke.
- a number of rides were closed for maintenance and then more due to the rain.
- many things closed around 5 pm, too many! With the rain and this, I found the park quite boring and looked forward to leaving but decided to swing by Muppet land where we managed to get on 3 rides in one hour. This area is great for under 5s but in saying that our almost 7 enjoyed it too.

In summary: visited La Universal 10yrs ahi and that was great. This time, with kids, it was a good but a number of disappointments for what it cost (time & $) ,too many things closed, not as exciting or magical as Disney.","Written March 4, 2020"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great tour,"If you love theme park, we highly recommend to visit Universal Studios. The crowd is not as important as in Disneyland in Tokyo if even if it was during a weekend in the summer. The park is quite big so one whole day is the minimum, and Harry Potter should be the first attraction to be visited since it is quickly full. People are very helpful and the visitors are very polite (queues are always respected), which makes your day way more enjoyable.

Thé only big problem we went through was when we booked through Tripadvisor that cancelled a few days before our weekend our tickets without explanations, we had to buy in a hurry a few days prior to our weekend.","Written February 29, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Surely this is the happiest place on earth!,"We got the day and a half pass and only just got to see all we wanted during this crowd free virus affected period.

I was waving to everyone before I even knew what I was doing and chatted to lots of lovely people in the well behaved queues.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,USJ is so much fun,"I've been to USJ three time with my family already. We just love this place! It's so much fun. Our favourites are Harry Potter, Jaws, Waterworld, Jurassic World, Terminator, Spiderman, and more. Only downside of course are the long lines. Getting fast pass is very expensive especially for a family of four. So we put up with the waiting and can't always get in all the rides that we want to in a single day. That's why we have been here 3 different times!","Written March 19, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,The best theme park ever 🎢🎢🎢,"The rides where great and the Spiderman ride is definitely good for anyone (adult or child ) great area for your kids and the Harry potter ride is a must do though make sure to pay extra for fast tracks on the jaws , Harry potter rides , Spiderman and jurrasic park because the queen's can get very long . The food is amazing serving western and Japanese food and definitely try the matcha ice cream but the best part is the parade but if you want to get to the subway station quicker and go to the gift shop miss out the last bit of the parade as it can get quite claustrophobic in the shop or subway.

This is the best theme park ever and a must do for Osaka","Written March 17, 2020"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,So much FUN !,"Awesome ride especially Harry Potter ride, dinasour ride and Hollywood Dream ride. I went there during Holloween and joined their Holloween party until 12am. So fun and awesomeness is on another level. Also being chased by Zombies is no joke. I screamed and laughed so hard while trying to rescue myself. The memories is unforgettable and it cheers me up whenever I feel down.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Awesome! No regrets with the 1.5 days tix,"After in depth research/reviews, we bought tickets on a Monday for 1.5 days. Voila! we managed to cover everything even though it was absolutely crowded.
And Fyi, 95% of the language either spoken by the staff or ride/show related were all in Japanese. Bits of Harry Potter were in English and oh thank God...”Sing” was in English and it was so much fun. Some staff do understand and speak basic English though I must say all of them were really very polite and looked very happy doing their job so that was very welcoming.
But I must warn you guys about the intro to the Terminator attraction. The lady in red took too long, tried to get the crowd in the mood but it was 100% in Japanese so for us it came across as boring and never ending.
The rest of the attractions were just like any other Universal Studios...amazing. Butter beer was a nice surprise. Toilets were pleasantly clean all day. There were different sized/priced storage lockers upfront which were convenient.
If you’re planning to watch the final show, staff will go all out to keep the walkway/seating in check. You’d have to sit within the road/garden site so head there earlier if you want a good spot. Only the Express pass will get you a seat on the platform.
The final Parade took quite some time to finish but worth the time, it was magical. I found the merchandise quite pricy then again everything in Japan is quite pricy.","Written February 16, 2020"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Royal studio pass,"We five intended to visit Univeral studio Japan on January 2nd. We knew that there would be very crowded so we would like to make sure that we could enjoy our rides without waiting very long.

We bought 5 Royal Studio Pass via Govoyagin website. Firstly we couldn’t book. So we sent an e-mail directly to them. They got back to us and asked for our airplane tickets and hotel confirmation. After that they sent us an e-mail with a link to book the pass. It was pre-paid. And when we checked in at our hotel, our 5 Royal Studio Pass wrist bands were there. Very professional.

These wrist bands gave us the most convenient way to enjoy USJ. We didn’t have to wait at all. There would be some rides that we had to go during the period of time and only one time for fast track such as Harry Potter,Minion etc. The rest we could go as many times as we wanted like a fast track eg. Jaws, Spider man etc.

Turkey legs were delicious here. We had a fun time.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Never too young!!!,My husband and I are in our 50s and we thoroughly enjoyed universal studios. We managed to do most of the rides with no ill effects. Fabulous day out for any age. I would highly recommend the Harry Potter ride,"Written February 12, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Awesome day out,Always a great place to go with the family. Some rides can be a bit of a wait but there is always something to do!,"Written February 12, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,So much fun!,"Having visited a couple other Universal Studios, I was a bit worried that this experience would be same old same old but it was not! We visited during Cool Japan and had so much fun. There are lots of adorable merchandise to browse and buy and the rides are a little more intense as compared to those in the United States. Sure everything is in Japanese but we already expected that. You can read the 'ride sypnosis' on USJ's website before going if it bothers you.

Tip: Get in line for the Attack on Titans 4D ride when the park opens. It's worth the wait and so popular they close the ride after lunch time. It was hands down the best ride in the park.","Written February 10, 2020"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"We went on WED and THURS (JAN 2020), very little crowd (and no Express Pass)","We bought tickets for 2 days (because we knew we will spend long time shopping and applying for tourist refund). 1st day was on 29th JAN 2020, and the next day 30th JAN. We got there at around 8:20 and 8:30 am and on both days we ended up quite close to the entrance when we arrived.

The park opened at 8:45 (eventhough it listed the to open at 9am). Since there was a ""Cool Japan"" event, our first priority was to ride the Attack on titan. Eventhough the queue listed at 45 mins, we got on the ride after about 20-25mins. It was a really cool indoor roller coaster ride with VR. This turned out to be the best decision because throughout the day the line for this were consistently 100-110mins. We went to Minion Meyham next with very little wait (20 mins) but it was really disappointing. Maybe more for kids. Minions Ray sliders was next and it was surprisingly good. Then we immidiately went for Harry potter ride and IT WAS AMAZING!!! This is the best ride I have ridden in awhile! The wait for this was about 45 mins (however we went in after 30 mins.) I noticed the listed wait times are often Over estimated. We did not go on the 2 roller coasters (Dinasour and Hollywood Dream) because we were more excited for the Harry Potter world. The ButterBeer is a MUST! we paid 650yen for it. Also, there is a line in HP world which seemed to lead nowhere....this is actually the line into the wand magic show. We went in and WE WERE PICKED TO GET A MAGIC WAND! WOW! However eventhough we won, the wand is NOT FREE and costs 4900 yen. With the wand you can go around the park and test your magic spells (like opening a locked door, lighting a fire lamp ect.) - gimicky if you ask me.

For lunch we ate at the 3 broomsticks - be warned, it was very expensive although very very delicious. I ordered the Sheperds pie - incredibly good! But the Fish and chips were salty! On the 2nd day we ate at The Dragon's Pearl - disappointing - Dont waste your money here!!! On both days we ate dinner at universal City walk mall (just outside Universal after we have exited the park). we ate pasta at Romaken (just beside matsumoto kiyoshi) - highly recommended and cheaper than eating inside USJ too.

Anyways, other rides we went on were Spiderman (really good), Terminator (just another 3-d show), Jaws( quite boring) and some kids rides (Elmos skateboard - which was surprisingly good, Flying Snoopy and Moopy's ballon). We went to ALmost all the shows, The SHrek 3-D and the Sing on Tour were really good! Water world (in Japanese so we did not understand) and BAckdraft were okay. I also enjoyed Monster's Rock and Roll show, but I have a feeling the japanese audiences did not - maybe because they sang mostly 80s english songs which I enjoyed very much!

But highlight of the trip was the light show at Harry potter world. This show is incredible and Not to be missed! The night parade was just okay - Pale in comparison with Disney's night parade.

The 2nd day we went on the Harry potter ride 3 MORE TIMES!!!! Yeah, we loved it that much! It was really impressive! And each time we did not was wait more than 20 minutes. Towards end of the day at around 6pm , we went on the ride again and had no wait at all because everybody were waiting at outside the castle to watch the light show. We also finished our shopping at around 4pm and at the time, the line for the tourist refund were really short!!! So, my advice is do your shopping early and get the tourist refund done early - as it gets really crowded at night.

We glad we came on wed and thurs. There were not many crowds at all. most rides had only 20-30 mins wait except the flying Dinosaur and hollywood dream and even that they were consistently 55-60 mins max everytime i checked. I saw some people buying express passes and cant help to think they just wasted their money on that day.","Written February 9, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,The staff were so friendly & happy,"If I was rating just the park I would of given a 4 star but due to the staff all being fantastic it’s gone up to a 5

The actual park is not the biggest and several rides are very dated now and need changing eg .... Back draft ride ... I’m 40 and even I don’t remember when that film came out or what’s it was about .... apart from fire lol
Terminator 2 ride was very slow and dragged , jaws classic ride can’t fault it , Spider-Man great , The pterodactyl ride in Jurassic Park was amazing and Harry Potter world didn’t disappoint

The late night parade was good and great effects

We went on Feb on a week day and the Qs were only half hr max so no issues there

Would recommend for a day out lots of fun and the staff were all fantastic",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,USJ trip,"Nice place to be there but there was so many people. If you intend to play, its best to buy the fast lane tickets so that you can enjoy it. I didn't have the time to enter bcos of so many people there & the queue was terrible.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Fun Place For Everyone!,"We visited on New Year's Eve and bought a pass for the day and the party that followed. The park is definitely similar to the US equivalents but a fun place to be and high quality! We went on the Jaws ride and it was fun. Of course it is all in Japanese but that is fine. After all you are in Japan. The Back Draft experience was fun for us but there is a lot of fire so if you have small children it may not be for you. Spiderman was very fun. Terminator 2 was okay but Spiderman is better if you have to make a choice. Sing the musical was okay but more so for kids. The Harry Potter ride was really fun but a lot of motion. My stomach was a little queasy but only for a short time. Great ride overall. Be sure that you understand whether the ride is open or not, We ignored a sign (or missed it) that said it was only a castle walk through and we waited in line a long time only to have no ride. We went later and it was outstanding! It would be nice if they had a fly over ride that had a big screen overview of Japan like California Disney has but alas, there is not one. Nice park and lots of good restaurant choices there as well. Expect Universal prices in the stores, but the restaurants were not overpriced as far as we were concerned. Of course we do not have children.","Written February 7, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Fun Way To Spend New Year's!,"We bought a ticket to the park so we could go during the day for a bit and then we left when they closed the park for an hour and rentered with the party entry ticket. Fun to walk around and see all the decorations for Christmas. The live entertainment was fun to watch from a distance but we did not stand in that area for very long as we wanted to experience the park.
It was cold and crowded, but we were dressed for it. I did buy a Jaws Hat and would have liked to have the royalties on the hats as they sold thousands of them! They do keep your head warm!
It was crowded but we worked through the crowds and got on the rides that we wanted to. The Minions and Harry Potter was where the big crowds were. The fireworks were fun and it was great that the park was open all night! Overall we had a great time. We had my niece who is 27 so 3 adults. Glad we went in during the day and had fun at night! Only giitch was the tight crowd pushing and shoving toward Harry Potter when the fireworks were over. We enjoyed it!",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"The Best of 3 Worlds - East, West and Magic!","It's not just western movie themed. If you're lucky, you might encounter Anime-themed attractions (sadly seasonal). Check their website for anime special rides and plan accordingly. You'll definitely enjoy Harry Potter. In fact, I suggest you book for 2 days, 1 for just Harry Potter and another for the rest of Universal.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Fabulous,"The first thing caught my eyes is the crystal festival. The field of Harry Potter is indeed sensational. But what impression last in my mind is the sense of humour that staffs have - little baby dinosaur in his unique babyseat and it's ""alive"" like his mum .......l mean ""vivid""! Very creative! Highly recommended!",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Osaka USJ - shockingly poor value for money !,"Osaka USJ - shockingly poor value for money !
You will probably regret this.

We regrettably paid for express 4 passes & express 7 had sold out 15 mins into opening time. But It was a complete waste (with a one-day studio pass) of over $500AUD! For 2 anyway.

Let’s face it Japan is very crowded & due to this quite regimented. USJ has ineffective management & poor staff supervision, I saw none.
The ride staff were actually quite rude often (I know right RUDE STAFF at a UNIVERSAL STUDIOS!) but it was far worse than just this, they were slow disengaged & unmotivated, this is totally unacceptable. I saw many groups of mostly young girl staff wandering around the park like they were guests, I mean with 70-120 min wait times for some rides & people queueing 30mins-45mins for a pretzel or churo…THIS IS SHOCKINGLY BAD!

USJ STAFF: YOUR JOB IS TO SERVE THE GUESTS AS FAST & FRIENDLY AS YOU CAN! Or be sacked!

I recommend Westerners to STAY AWAY! You won't like this. There is little value placed on your freedom here, it’s a real circus and not in a good way! park management obviously failing to put any reasonable limits on how many attendees they admit to the park.
It was not a casual fun experience. It was like being marched around in a prison camp!
All the above has a de-valuation effect in my opinion, damaging the historically great entertainment based name of Universal Studios USA

The food in the outlets, which could have saved them, absolutely did not!
We had a burger at Mels Diner early before lunch - why would an attraction making such huge profits skimp on the food – This was nothing like what you might get at a real American diner.

We turned to Alcohol (Extortion like prices) to cover up how we were feeling about how bad this was.

I recommend to Universal Studios America to undertake an assessment here, it’s no good if a foreign operator is wrecking your brand! Maybe bring is a consultant from the Singapore USS.

I’ve been to all the Disney Parks in Japan multiple times & recommend you choose Disneyland & Disneysea Tokyo Bay – its far superior to this atrocious greedy wrecking ball to western values.
There is nothing fun about this claustrophobic regimented experience. UGH!

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Great for families, be prepared to walk and have fun","Went there early December, the lines were supposedly not as long as expected but it was cold.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Amazing entertainment for all ages!,"We regret not spending more than a day in USJ, as there were a lot to discover here that we were not able to. Highly recommended to go for 2 days the least, or buy an express pass so that you do not have to line up and spend a minimum of 1.5 hours in line with the best rides that they have here (Harry Potter, Minions, etc). Prices are just like the western universal studios, but hey, they will milk you out as much as possible, as expected. Money grabbing dudes as they even ask for more money to have the best seat in the parade, which actually you can avoid paying by just being there earlier. We enjoyed wasting our money here, so money well spent. ;-) Kids were ecstatic!",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,number one must visit park,"I am proud to say I am happy I put visiting USJ as the activity for my first day in OSAKA. I bought the tickets online and got an e-ticket form (which ease me from printing and folding papers in my bag). My sister and I arrived in front of the gate by 08.50 using JR Haruka Limitted Express. (you can buy the JR 5 days pass in Klook with a good deal, i'll write about this in another page) Anyways, the queue was long for a low season day. (FRI 10 jan 2020) but we managed to get through the security bag check after 20 minutes. Visitors are not allowed to bring selfie sticks, they were asked to keep them in a locker. Once inside, we directly ran to the WWOHP. Oh yeah make sure you wear comfortable shoes for many walks. The WWOHP is less crowded in the morning and since we did not buy the express pass or Harry potter timed ticket pass (we just have the regular ticket and with great planning it is more than enough). We rushed to queue for the Forbidden Journey ride! Lucky us we only queue for 45 mins! This ride is a must, though we've played this in Hollywood, we play it one more time in Japan. Then after the ride, we took pictures and drink the famous butter beer. Japan offers hot butterbeer during cold seasons and this tastes better!
When the visitors flooded the WWOHP area, we moved to Amityville and ride the one and only Jaws experience in Japan! This is fun even though we had no idea of the Japanese drama. Then we had lunch at Three broomsticks around 11.45 and it's starting to get full, but we found a nice spot outside. Lunch was magical with the Hogwarts Castle view. I got a nice shot from the outdoor area. Then to digest our food, we do the Harry Potter castle walk. Afterwards, we queue for the (must ride) Pterodactyls in the Jurasic world. Then there's the amazing spiderman ride which is suitable for all age. We skipped all of the shows for we've seen a lot of them in the other Universal Studios. Sadly one of the big ride (the one rollercoaster which were pulled backwards) were under maintenance and we cannot ride it.
We did not wait for the parade at night, for we have another itinerary waiting, but by 16.00 we've bought our last souvenirs and say goodbye to USJ.
Skipped minion and all the shows for kids.
We took a lot of pictures and enjoyed more of the vibes there!
The regular tickets works best when you planned everything well.
See you another day USJ!
Meet sanrio characters and other famous characters
Gotta say Japan has a lot of characters posing for pictures. We met all of elmo's friends, minions and gru, and of course Hello kitty and marilyn monroe.
The employees are super nice and kind, they won't hesitate taking pics for you!
Visit Olivander's wand shop in the morning, before the lines are long.

There's a lot of restaurants and cafes in front of the gate. Just outside the train station and before the USJ main gate.
If you use JR pass, stop at Universal City station, once you get off just walk to the left and voila you're there!",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Nice to be here and feeling crazy,"Veryy nice to be here and everyone's dream world .

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Different style of amusement park,"I've visit disneyland and disney sea last with my family..and have a great time there..while universal from my personnal point of view is giving a different taste.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Fun and Friendly Staff,"This is second visit to Universal Studios Japan because of 'Harry Potter'. Bought the Universal Express Pass Package which was quite expensive to avoid the approximately 2 hours queuing for several attraction/rides. The restaurants good food, especially the Finnegan Bar & Grill.","Written January 20, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,not great value for money,"As a family with 2 teenagers, we visited USJ. While we got the 15 minute early entry, we were done just after 2pm. There are about 4 main rides and Harry Potter world. There is no much after that. For the price that we paid for the tickets, I did not find this to be good value.","Written January 19, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Incredibly friendly staff!!,"We had a super fun day exploring the park, and found the staff so so friendly, helpful and enthusiastic. We treated ourselves to an express pass which was very expensive but it was nice to skip the queue on a few key rides. Not sure you’d need it In low season though.","Written January 18, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Lots of fun,"Our 11 and 8 year olds picked this cos of Harry Porter and it was worth it. I personally am not a roller coaster fan but by the end of the one day, I must admit it was lots of fun. Plenty of screams and adventures and would advise the purchase of express pass unless you have lots of time to sit in the queues","Written January 17, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Mixed opinions,"Let's start that this park is quite different from the one I visited in Orlando, Florida. There are some rides built only there and some are missing. Especially the ride on the pterodactyl tail.
The local ride, Attack on Titans, unfortunately, was closed and we couldn't do it. There is another huge ride which is closed as well.
First tip: get to the park from Monday to Thursday. Check if no holidays are happening in country. This will save you from overcrowding.
Huge tip: should you plan not to get express pass I highly recommend choosing to go via solo lanes. Way faster, ignores 2 hour waiting time. The only negative is the one cannot sit next to their friends/family. It is possible to ask at the ride if they have solo queues or check on booklets (found on internet or handed out at the entrance). As a result, we manneged to do almost all major rides without waiting ages.
How to get there? There is a designated JR train connected to main train lines of Osaka. In stations there are various signs indicating which station to take. Don't worry to ask staff, very helpful and resourceful. From Nararel hostel it took us 30mins to get there.
The only drawback of the park are prices. Some prices of the place are skyrocketing. The wands start from 4200 yens which is more then a half of ticket. Food is fresh and decent, no complaints here.
Almost forgot, terminator 3d show is my personal sleeper. Even if you don't understand Japanese it is rather easy to follow the action. I have never seen that footage with original actors from the franchise. Well worth for anyone.
In sum, it was a well spent time full of surprises, great March, tears and 3 rides on HP castle. Despite high prices and sometimes overcrowded days, I highly recommend this park for a visit for families, couples or solo travellers",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Very good!!!,Very good. We are planning to go for the second time in this japan trip. Trust me this is worth the money and time!,"Written January 16, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Extremely expensive for not a lot of rides,At $800 (Australian) I expected more rides. We paid for the express pass 4 and in total used 11 rides / shows over 8 hours. A lot of the shows like Jaws and Backdraft were in Japanese so pretty much a waste of time. This was all the rides possible (other than very young kiddie rides) and included the Flying Dinosaur twice. We have kids aged 10 and 12. They loved it but we felt ripped off. The food was outrageously priced - we spent $55 (!) on popcorn which included a plastic minion holder ($45 with popcorn plus one refill an extra $10) one ice cream sundae ($12) looked big enough for two to share but was a small cup inside a large bucket to trick you into thinking it had more in it. All in all left starving and feeling ripped off.,"Written January 16, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Didn’t need Express pass in witner,We didn’t mind waiting for the rides as the queues weren’t too bad. The best rides were the Harry Potter school and the Jurassic park flying roller coaster. Waterworld show was awesome but Backdraft was not worth the wait. Wish we’d seen the little Japanese restaurant near San Fransisco instead of all the cheap fast food options. We left on a high! Such a great day!,
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Christmas at Hogwarts,"Christmas in Tokyo had served up plenty of carols and Christmas cheer, but I’d missed out on a traditional Christmas lunch. I was at KFC that day (yep, it’s a thing; look it up). But it felt super Christmassy at Hogsmeade – cold weather, wreaths, hot butter beer - and a full, traditional Christmas meal, followed by treacle pudding at The Three Broomsticks! Merry Christmas, Harry.","Written January 15, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Christmas Day treat,Went here as a family of 4 for Christmas Day. We Pre bought royal vip fastpass. Very expensive but well worth it. We had timed entry to the top rides and only waited a few minutes to ride when the actual queues were 2 hours long!!! Very festively decorated. We had turkey dinner at the broomsticks all very nice. We had a great Christmas,
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Good fun visit,"Best to go earlier in the morning to avoid the long lines of the rides. The Harry Potter is a must of course to visit. The line was a challenge, for such a quick experience. Overall it was fun to go to USJ","Written January 15, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Adventure,Been here several time already. Always greeted with crowded people. A must place to be also when in Osaka,"Written January 13, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Don't go during Holidays,"We went there on New Year's day & it was not a wise choice.

The park itself is OK - good layout, accessible, good variety of rides and entertainment. But we didn't get to fully appreciate it because of the thick crowd, long queue and limited operation hours.

Go on off-peak, never during Holidays.","Written January 11, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Definitely get an express pass and visit in off oeak,"We were there at 8:30am and the lines were okay for an off peak day. The problem was that unlike Singapore, they bag check everyone. So once the doors opened, it was another 30mins to get in. Unfortunately the Hollywood section was closed which was really disappointing. The lines were insane - even on an off peak day when the park was at 15% capacity lines were still over an hour. We had a fast pass 4 and that was worth it, the rides we used it on had 60-70min lines and we lined up for less than 10mins each time.

There are minimal places to sit down around the park and I got told off quite a few times by staff for sitting on a garden bed edge or on a curb due to the lack of seating. I have an injury so the lack of seating was a real issue for me.

Be aware everything is in Japanese - none of the rides or 3D sections have any English parts. This means terminator, Harry Potter, backdraft, Spider-Man and jaws have NO ENGLISH at all so you have to just enjoy the ride with no idea what’s actually being said.

It was good fun for a day but at close to $200 AUD each for entry and a fast pass, the Singapore one is much better.","Written January 9, 2020"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Enjoyable - one of the better amusement parks,"Highly recommend Prebooking express tickets if you can afford. Very expensive and they were sold out anyway when we bought tickets at the gate. So we had to wait in line like all the other commoners.

Unfortunately we went during Christmas/new year so children were on school holidays. The good thing was that the lines were shorter than they were labelled. 40 minute waits were usually 20.

The bad thing was there was no wifi in the park so I couldn’t message my husband. Which meant we had to wait for each other to finish a ride with one of our kids before coming back and going to another ride (one child was too scared to go on roller coasters.. or anything really). So we didn’t get to go on every ride we wanted to.

The main roller coaster in Jurassic Park had a huge 75 minute wait so we decided to sacrifice that one. It looked amazing though. Hanging from the harness in a flying kind of position.

My favourite ride was the Space Fantasy. I think it could be my favourite ride ever actually. Zipping around the universe and taking in the sights of Saturn and other planets was so fun! Something beautiful to look at whilst simultaneously hurtling around and screaming with joy made it very memorable.

Would not recommend going to the 3D/4D shows if you can’t understand Japanese. They don’t have translation and we just stood there wondering how to escape because we had such limited precious time (it wasn’t possible to leave because we were standing in the middle of a large crowd).","Written January 7, 2020"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Enjoyed End of Year 2019 Here, will come back given the chance","Went here on 31 Dec 2019, family trip with 2 small children (8&5).

As any major tourist attraction in high season, it is very crowded. Everything from entrance, rides, restaurants and toilets needs queue.

As a very large park, USJ managed well with the crowds. But unfortunately is very tiring to get from one place to another.

We entered and went directly to Harry Potter ride inside the Hogwarts castle. As a huge fan, almost all of the things in the HP world brings a smile to my face (but butterbeer is overrated to my muggle taste).

Next to Jurassic Park, had lunch which is expensive and tasted average, but no other option. My wife who is an adrenaline junkie loves the Flying Dinosaur. Using single line, we didn’t wait too long for her. While waiting, the kids enjoyed My Friend Dinosaur parade. Then we all went for Jurassic Park the ride and got a little bit wet and cold (winter, duh).

After Jurassic, went to Snoopy area, and queue to flying snoopy, but as the Express pass holder entered and entered the line, the reguler line didn’t move at all. We then gave up for the flying snoopy and went indoor for the snoopy roller coaster, a little queue there. My little boy enjoyed Elmo’s car. Then we went up the carousell but after a 10 mins delay, they announced that it was broken and we were asked to dismount.

Then we went to watch SING theatre, quite entertaining and a good rest as it is sitting down for around 10 mins.

Unfortunately we just found out that on that day, the park closed at 5. We misread the info that the park is open for 26 hours. Indeed it is open till midnight (fireworks show) but after 5PM, you will need another ticket to enjoy the park after hours.

So after finding out that the park is closing, we only got the chance to ride one more which is Minions Race, just a spinning ride.

Overall, the park is very enjoyable eventhough crowded. All of the staff is very friendly and making the guest experience very enjoyable.

Recommended for everyone, and if given the chance I will come back again with my family as we only rode less that 25% of all of the rides.",

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Hot summer day at USJ,Got to get there early before the park open. Japanese are crazy about the amusement park too. So there will be a long line at the entrance. The Harry Potter section does not require special admission so you can go in. But super long line for the line. At least an hour or more. It is very tiring to go during summer time. The weather is hot and th Elaine is long. Be prepared to suffer😂,
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great Family Entertainment,"Great for family with kids, outing with friends or couples ..

All good, except for it’s quite costly.

Good late afternoons and stay till closing at 2130pm. Less people, shorter queues, and enjoy all the rides and games without the fuss",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Universal Studios Osaka Harry Potter Wizarding World,"Absolutely fantastic day and a half spent at Universal Studios Osaka, Harry Potter Wizarding World. The activities with the Universal Studios wands is just magical.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Lots of fun rides,"Visited USJ on a Wednesday where the season is marked as 'A' and without the Express pass.

Parked is crowded but we managed to try most of the must try rides. During our visit, the waiting time ranges between 45mins to 95mins each.

Rating from us for the rides we tried:
1) Flying dinosaur
2) Hollywood backdrop (must do the backwards ride)
3) Despicable Me Minion Mayhem
4) Spider-Man 4K3D ride
5) Harry Porter - Flight of Hippogriff","Written December 22, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,It's Universal Studios - but in Japan!,"Very weird coming here as it is SO similar to the one in Hollywood, minus the studio tour of course! But the whole feel of the place, and many of the rides and attractions, are exactly the same. We went because a niece is performing in one of the live shows, but in fact had a good day all round! The shows are brilliant and the rides we went on were also excellent. But Hogwarts as an area was the best part of the day! It just looks and feels as you would imagine it would do.
There are quite a few food options on the park; we had pizza for lunch, which was surprisingly good, and later on popped into the diner for drinks. Neither was ridiculously expensive given that you are in a theme park so are a captive clientele.
Getting to USJ is pretty straightforward on the Osaka subway and local train line, with just a couple of minutes' walk, clearly signposted, when you leave the station.","Written December 22, 2019"

Amazing rides ... great food options ... super clean
Toilets ...
Lots of characters freely available

Photos .

Wear the most comfortable
Shoes
Lots of walking ...

The park is magical , the attention to detail is beyond perfection .. the rides are different from
The other universals visited they seem longer and are more enjoyable .
Only negative criticism is that
The introductions to some rides like backdraft and the Minions is tooooo long before the rides start .. it seems like a delaying tactic to make it seem like u started the ride but its still another 10
minutes to the start of the ride and this is AFTER you get into
The ride ... i am not
Not talking about the queues before you start the ride .

But that said i LOVED the park loved the rides and will
Return ...loves the caramel
Popcorn .
Fast passes can be purchased with different options depending on which rides appeal to you ... worth it although very expensive . Most rides have the option of single riders which move very fast and beat the queues.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"A long, fun filled family day.","Purchased entry tickets plus express 4 from Klook for 2A, 2C (8 & 10) as the only day we could attend was a Sunday. Not cheap! Surprisingly, the waits for rides didn't exceed an hour but our express pass certainly helped when we were tired at the end of the day. Arrived 30 mins before opening and left 30 mins before close and we didnt do all the rides.
Kids loved Jaws (did it twice), Harry Potter, Spiderman, Terminator, with most enjoyable and memorable moments going to Jurassic ride (be warned - if you are in the front - you WILL get wet!) We didnt do rollercoasters due to both waits and lack of interest.
A couple of rides/ experiences are lost due to the language such as Backdraft and Minions. Waterworld was action packed and even without speaking Japanese were were able to still enjoy in the pre-show activities thanks to the great actors.
Buying a wand and casting spells, watching stage shows throughout USJ and soaking up the atmosphere all made for a fun family day.
We found although the food looked amazing, didnt really taste that great and we craved a decent meal by the end of the day.","Written December 19, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,A fun day at USJ,"We traveled by train to the Universal Studios from Shin Osaka. It required two changes (from one line to another) but not too difficult to navigate.

It was a Friday on our visit and the park was full of school children in uniform.

We had purchased the tickets online and also the express pass which saved us some time especially for the popular rides.

We took the forbidden ride in Harry Potter, the Jaws boat cruise and the Despicable Minions. These are not the scary rides but all fun and enjoyable.

One disappointing fact is that the movies and explanations were all in Japanese without English subtitles. Given the volume of International tourists I would expect the park to provide English subtitles for the benefit of non Japanese speakers.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Good Code A Day without Express Pass,"We bought our tickets online from Klook for Code A week and the tickets are emailed to us and we just printed the tickets directly. Do not resize the tix. QR code is scanned at entry.
We arrived at 8.30am and park opened at 9.30am. We ran to Harry Potter for our 1st ride. I think it is better to do Flying Dinosaur as 1st ride and then go to Harry Potter for picture taking. You may ride Harry Potter after 7pm with no wait at all. On average, Flying Dino has a 100min wait. Maybe it is due to the fact that it was closed for 1-2 hrs in the late morning. All other rides were a wait of 15min to 30min. Minion is 45min but i think it was due to the silly introduction which I almost drifted off to wonderland. We didnt watch any show since it was in Japanese. In between we had more than 2hrs of rest for lunch and dinner and after 2nd ride of Harry Potter after 7pm, we had more than 2 hrs of free time for shopping! We did sit all rides.
A family of 7 bought the 7 express passes and told us it was truly a waste of money as the wait wasn't long. However you may check if other weeks require express passes.","Written December 17, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great visit for families,"We had an extra day in Osaka and decided to visit Universal studios with our 7 year old. It is highly recommended to buy entrance tickets ahead of time (available here on trip advisor) and show up at least 30min before opening to take advantage of the first 30 min when waiting time is low. We bought the 4 ride express pass at the gate and while it saved us about 30 per ride on a rainy Monday in December I believe this is a must for weekend visitors during peak season. Harry Potter ride and experience was great and very impressive, we also enjoyed the minions and Spider-Man as well as the traditional roller coasters.","Written December 15, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,One of the best theme parks in Asia,"Be sure to arrive early in the park as the lines go very long in the middle of the day. For foreigners it is best to buy the 1.5 day pass so you can explore the park more and take many pictures. Also it is advise to eat first before entering the park because the food is quite expensive inside if you are on the budget. Be sure not to miss the night parade and ride Hollywood dreams, flying dinosaur, and Harry Potter.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great place to start to a trip to Japan,"Universal is a great place to begin a trip in Japan. Our class trip was a first time experience for many students to Japan, so it was a excellent place to begin, considering our tight timetable.","Written December 14, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Though packed but queue is fast moving,"Visited USJ in late November. I was contemplating whether to buy fast pass. However, due to the high cost, i have decided to give up the idea.
Arrived USJ before it opened. Waited outside for almost an hr before we are allowed in. Once in, we proceeded to the popular rides first. To our surprise, though there's queue, we did not wait long to get on the rides. On average, we waited for an hour or less to get on the rides.","Written December 14, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"A small USJ park, crowded, business minded feeling","the overall impression of this USJ Osaka was small, crowded park with less attractions and very business minded kind of feeling. Some attractions are alright e.g Hollywood wonderland, Harry Potter castle, Amazing Spiderman etc, the rest was ok, no surprised. Food are boring yet expensive and long queue as any Uni Studios e.g. burger, pizza, fried chicken rice etc. If you were first timer visiting Uni studio, you might be having lots of fun, but if you have visited other Uni studio, then Dun expect too high","Written December 12, 2019"

The rides will either make you go scared or crazy with its twists for you to enjoy. Although it’s a given that there will be a long line to some of the rides still, we’ve managed to try out a lot of rides. Regarding souvenirs, food and other stuff..there are some that price is reasonable. So no worries, you will still enjoy USJ without getting broke",

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great fun,I had a lot of fun here. Although some shows were hard to follow as they were in Japanese (as can be expected) I purchased the express pass which included 4 rides. I went on a Tuesday and probably the only ride that helped having the express was the Flying Dinosaur ride. Most others it only took a max of 15 mins to get through. So it probably wasn’t worth the extra $$.,"Written December 11, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Fun for all the family,"We had 3 kids under 9 youngest being 6mths. All the kids had fun, and there were so many things for them to do. Great rides for the older kids as well as those thrill seeking older ones. We didn't get to go on all the rides partly due to kids, but also due to some wait times, so if you are going best to go mid week (we went on a Monday) or get a fast pass, its basically the same cost as admission but if you only get to do it once, you wont want to be standing around in ques and miss shows etc. But the atmosphere there is buzzing, so you really get into it.","Written December 10, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Time to be a kid again!,"What more can I say...it's a magical place to be! We were fortunate to come when there not too many people. We didn't even have to line up for the Harry Potter area. The attractions did not disappoint. There were places where we could refresh ourselves from the heat, love those water mist sprayers. Clean. Super cheerful and attentive staff.","Written December 9, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,A great day out,"We arrived at 9.30am (normal entry opening time) the entry was jam packed and people were everywhere, but the staff were efficient and lovely. I would recommend going to Lawsons' just after getting of the train to grab snacks and lunch as they have a great variety which is fresh and healthy but also at a great price.
We headed straight to Harry Potter and were able to get on the rides there within 30 minutes each. The trip around the studio was fun however, line up/queue times were what we spend the bulk of the day doing. If you can afford it get the express pass available. You could actually spend a couple of days here if you have the time. We all agreed that the best ride was Hollywood Dream the ride, this also goes backwards but had an extended wait time.
All in all a great day.",

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Cute interior design for christmas,"Before you enter the park , they need to check your bag very detail. You are not allow to bring food, drinks, some camera and video equipment and a lot of other rules. You should check at the website. The park interior is so cute and pretty for christmas. A lot of ride is challenging for adult than disneyland. Before you come check the schedule carefully. May be because we don’t come on peak day the park close earlier and there’s no night parade. They only have christmas show not parade which make me feel dissapointed at this point.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Timing is Everything,"Before coming, I had read the reviews about crowds and was expecting the worst. To my surprise, although busy, it wasn’t “out of control”.

We were here on a Thursday in early December - the estimated crowd (google USJ Crowd Calendar) forecast 17,000. Queues for the popular rides were around 1hr though we went as singles which typically meant 10-20min waits.

Harry Potter was the highlight with the rides and “streets” having a very authentic integrated feel.

The Flying Dinosaur was the definite thrill ride, being both long and terrifying.

One negative is that some “rides” are only in Japanese. For Jaws that didn’t really matter, but Backdraft lost a lot of impact. Most major attractions that we visited, the language didn’t matter or they did dual language or sub titles.

You can’t leave and re enter so you have to buy food there (not allowed to bring in?). Food was ok but expensive as you might expect.","Written December 5, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Birthday visit!,"We took my sister for her birthday and it was the best birthday ever! You can get a birthday sticker from any staff member in the shops and when staff see you wearing it, they wish you a happy birthday! All staff, in the street, at rides, at shops and even serving staff in restaurants (they list it as an item on the receipt so when you collect your food, all the staff know).

It rained a bit while we were there which kinda sucked but it wasn't heavy rain so it's didn't stop any rides or shows.

If you want to make sure to get on every ride, you should definitely buy the Universal Express Pass (you can buy tickets online even if you don't live in Japan, you just need a credit card). The queues for most rides are in excess of 120mins at any time of day. Express Pass will have you on the ride in less than 15 minutes.

Best rides to experience: The Flying Dinosaur (roller-coaster), Hollywood Dream (roller-coaster) , Spiderman (4D moving cart on a track) and Harry Potter Forbidden Journey (4D moving chair on a track).

Merchandise is far more expensive than other theme parks in Japan (such as Disney). But it's very good quality in most cases. You can get very cool light up goods for the night time, unique goods exclusive to the park and many fun headbands and hats to show your appreciation for characters.

The food is very yum, we really enjoyed eating at the Three Broomsticks in the Harry Potter area. It was very western cuisine such at pot pies, salads, whole corn on the cob, chicken with mashed potatoes etc. Felt a lot like being a student at Hogwarts for sure! And of course, during winter the hot butterbeer was a delight.","Written December 4, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Good, but you need to pay attention for all","First of all is not as the same as the universal parks in USA, and I got a little beat surprised that there open the doors of the park earlier, also you need to ask for all the information about the schedule of activities, also in weekends you need to reserve a fast pass or when you enter the park go for the fast pass of the attractions you must like.

In my case I also had a problem in the tax free, and the don't help me. In the park all the things were well but after buying a lot of things they don't return you the tax of 10% only 8% also if you buy things for a friend in Japan you can apply for it to tax free, because you can open the bag until you leave Japan.","Written December 2, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Loved the Harry Potter ride,Loved the Harry potter ride but the place was crazy crowded. Lot of people in Harry potter costume gave it a even more appropriate feel.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Good fun,"We'd already been to Universal Studios in LA, so this may have affected my rating as I'd already experienced this before. If I hadn't, I am predicting my rating might be higher. It was very similar to the US version we went to, except everything was in Japanese, at times hard to understand (especially for kids).

When we first arrived, we sent straight for the Harry Potter ride. It stopped half way through and we were left hanging for 2-3 ? minutes, luckily we weren't upside down. However, the staff were amazing, and let us ride a second time without having to line up.

The Terminator experience was amazing, I loved how they used a combination of 3D with people actors. Even though it was in Japanese, we could understand what was happening, it was very well articulated.

Food is very expensive! For a budget holiday, eat before you go, go early and then leave. We were there for about 3 hours. A fun family experience.",

Season/Tickets
We visited in November so definitely out of the main season so neither had to wait long in entrence line, nor did we need the extra free tickets to the wizard world people have been writing about - because there weren’t that many crowds.

We also bought the tickets at the main gate but in high season I’d recommend to buy them in advance, the ticket-scan line should be shorter and faster.

Rides
For the main and most popular rides we waited at a maximum of 30minutes (even though the signs said 40-50min). We had the Standard tickets so it was more than descent waiting time knowing how long these lines can be.
If your main purpose is to do the rides or you’re visiting during prime season I’d recommend the Express ticket which allows one to skip the line through the fast track.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,A Must-go place in Osaka if you are a themepark lover!,"It was raining since morning til late at night, even though i was drenched but i enjoyed myself on the roller coaster rides 'Backdrop' & the 'Hollywood Dream'.

The staffs were very cheerful and friendly also helpful even though some of them cant really understand english. I will definitely visit again...

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Worth the visit (read this tips),"1. Remember entrance ticket fee is a separate ticket from Express ticket fee.

2. Do get your express ticket (I chooses 4 ride) it saves you tons of time queuing.

3. If you are not getting the express ticket, then separate from your group of friends and take the single lane instead.

4. You can bring empty water bottle inside to refill water in the park. No outside food allowed.

5. Organise which ride you want to go first then move from there, instead of running back and forth. It saves your energy.

6. Not enough cash to buy those cute souvenir or dine in restaurant? You can use credit card.

7. There a small Q beside the Harry Potter shop nearby the giant 🌲, you get to visit the experience how Ollivanders in Diagon Alley chooses the wand. Surprise? He will select a random person from the crowd and gave out a wand.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Winter Special is really special!,"I booked a ticket to USJ on Klook (try to book on a weekday if possible) and since it was a Saturday, I expected the long queue, so I was there 10 minutes before it opened up. First mission, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey.

I followed the attraction and ended up riding most of the rides, as I went there solo, so I could use the single rider lane. So the waiting wasn't really that bad for me, except for the Jurassic Park the ride (40 minutes queuing for a less than 1 min ride). Since I went there in November, they have already started their winter special, and boy oh boy, it was really special. Don't miss the Harry Potter Winter Special and the Crystal Night Parade. I suggest go for the Crystal first, then run to Harry Potter. The show for Harry Potter will repeat every 15 minutes for 2 hours. And for the show, the language is in English, so fret not for those non-Japanese speaking tourist.

Food for halal traveller can be tricky, but I found a pizza parlour that serves non-meat pizza and it was delicious.
Overall, don't miss USJ in Autumn. It would be better if I can't understand Japanese.","Written November 17, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great fun day out!,"Super rides and great placemaking with fake streets and sets that look great. Staff were very happy and helpful and additional shows took place across the park for free.

Highly recommend the Harry Potter area, Jaws Ride and Jurassic Park rides.

The only downside was most announcements and video introductions to the rides didn’t have English subtitles (I don’t recommend going into Backdraft because the whole thing is explained in Japanese! Unusual considering it is an American brand)

Otherwise a highly recommended and fun day out, with affordable food options and a good selection of shops. Only big downside was no WiFi, not great for tourists who don’t have access to 4G and get bored in queues!",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Lovely, clean grounds and cute merchandise!
(Skip the Christmas Crystal show)","It was my second trip to USJ this year. The first time around May this year and I thoroughly enjoyed myself even going with 2 very young kids (1.5yo and 3.5yo) My kids were very entertained with Sesame street, Minions, Hello Kitty and the Snoopy rides. If you were wondering if bringing young kids is difficult, it is not. It is a kid friendly place although with very young kids it is still quite a hassle. There are also plenty of food options. I unfortunately did not manage to try the exciting rides so I can't review those. The night parade was especially spectacular! My husband was blown away and decided to purchase the annual pass because of the parade.

HOWEVER, from 14th November 2019, the nightly parade is being done away and in its place is a Christmas Crystal performance which would cost you a further ¥1500+ to watch it. SKIP IT. The performances were rather nice...there were fireworks at the end but I think it would only entertain true Christmas fans. There were no familiar USJ characters participating in the Christmas performances so kids might get bored fast. We thought the usual nightly parades are so much better.","Written November 14, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,USJ Tips for families,"We went there on a weekday in October with two young school aged kids and I thought I’d leave a few tips for others who may be visiting the park while in Osaka. - Ticket purchase: buy them online in advance to save queuing up on the day. - Consider using ‘direct-in’ with QR codes on your phone. If you have small children and have to use only your phone to enter, this isn’t an issue either, just make sure you display each QR for each child at the gate. - If you have a Japanese friend, you can also ask them to help you order tickets through Lawson (Convenient store) and pay in any Lawson Loppi machine rather than ordering from Klook or Voyagin. - If your birthday is a month before or a month after the planned visit day, you can get discount, though to get this discount you have to go into their official web page which is in Japanese so this might not be easy. If you speak Japanese or have a friend who does, this could save you a bit of money. We saved 500 yen per ticket (family members are also entitled to the same discount). - Express Pass: choose the date/day of your visit and you might not need this. We considered spending £700 on the day pass plus Express pass 4 for four of us and in the end we didn’t and it worked out more than ok. (More details as below) - Pick a normal weekday and make sure it isn’t a local holiday etc and check the crowd forecast before booking your tickets - Arrive early because they often open earlier than the official opening time. We arrived at 7.10 for 8.30 opening and the gate actually opened 45 min earlier than expected so we managed to get in before 8am, gaining the valuable 45min to make a head start! When we went, the park was a lot less busy in the morning but as the day went on it was busier and by 1pm it was double the amount of people or more so use your morning time well! - Use your lunch time well, eat early or eat much later as people tend to go to take time away from going to attractions around this time. Strictly speaking no food from outside is allowed, and they do indeed check your bags from time to time, but you can sneak in a couple of rice balls or sausage in your jacket pockets (there is Lawson around the corner) to save you both the money and time to queue up for food at lunch time. - Use the board to check the waiting times for different attractions and be flexible in your plan - Take bottles to fill up water with so that valuable time isn’t spent on queuing at a cafe to get drinks etc - Check out the time for the parade and be at the start of the parade at least 30 min before to get a good spot - this is particularly important for those with small children as they can’t get a good view with too many people in front of them. The leaflet shows the route for the parade. - Harry Potter area: Previously you needed time entry pass to this area but these days it is a free entry area unless it is exceptionally busy. We had no wait time at all to get on Forbidden Journey first thing in the morning by just making a dash to the area (with two young kids too!) and going straight in. - Take disposable water proofs from 100 yen shop so that you don’t get wet when you are on some of the rides! - Don’t miss out the castle light up at Harry Potter area! It was meant to be at 18.55 (for the first showing) but it actually started at 18.30 presumably because there were a lot of people gathering already. This is in front of the castle, in the open. I would recommend you to get there at least 30 min early but if not, note you don’t need to be right at the front of the crowd; most of the entertainment is the light effects on the castle which you can see from quite far back so don’t panic if you don’t manage to get there early to get to the front of the crowd. - Wait time: remember that the wait time sign is often overestimated. This is the times and time we spent queuing at each attractions we went: 7:55am HP Forbidden Journey - no wait time 8.35am Jurassic Park the Ride estimated wait time 25 min but got on the ride in 10min 8.55am Jurassic Park the Ride (kids wanted to go on it again) same again 10min 10am Sing on (show) Got there 15 min early and we got in ok 11.15am Minion Ride - estimated wait time 50 min but it was only 30 min in the end 12.45am Amazing Spider-Man estimated wait time 75 min but got on the ride in 40 min Had Late lunch 14:00 am Went to get a good spot for the parade staring at 14.30 am. Already people taking up their spots and regretted not coming sooner. We spent the rest of the day visiting different areas covering different street shows etc. My final and perhaps one of most important tips that I can give to families with children visiting USJ... Do take your kids to toilet before queuing for each attraction! Despite taking kids to the restroom regularly, we still got ourselves in a situation whereby one of our kids went, mummmm I need to go to the toilet half way through a very long queue with no option of going back!! Luckily the queue moved quickly and she managed to hold on till the end of the ride, but it was pretty stressful!! Oh and have a chat with kids to decide on a memorable location to meet in case you get separated. We decided that beside the dinosaur at the entrance of Jurassic Park area was a good place to remember at the start :) We enjoyed our visit to USJ (though it was VERY tiring lol) and hope you will too!!",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Fun and well maintained park,Overall the park was a pleasant visit. It had a combination of classic and new ride attractions. The roller coasters were the main highlight and were both thrilling and fun. As usual for amusement parks the wait times were hours long so an express pass at a much higher price may be the way to go to make waits less frustrating and exhausting. I would recommend this for all families visiting Osaka.,
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Express pass ain’t worth it,"My friends and I planned to get express pass to go on the rides but apparently you choose which one and what time and can only go once. They had one that was 7 rides express and costs nearly double the entry price. In LA, you can get an express pass and use it unlimited. We chose not to get the express pass and just follow the crowd but we had the plan by going in the single riders line which cut the time but made my friends and I seperate which wasn’t an issue for us. Also it wasn’t overly busy as the lines were pretty good.","Written November 13, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,A fun day!,"We came to USJ on the eve of Halloween and it was very crowded (not sure if it was more than usual). But besides that we had a great time exploring the park and taking various rides.

A highlight (and the main reason) for me to visit USJ was the Harry Potter attraction. It was particularly special at night when the lights were turned on.

What I really liked about USJ was that there were ample benches around if you got tired walking and wanted to rest for abit. What would be nice is if there were more English translation for the attractions.

Tip: if possible, buy your tickets online so you skip the long queue at the ticket booth. It will save you at least half an hour. If you are a tourist and buy enough merchandise to claim back tax, be prepared for a VERY long queue.

At the end of a long day, we were exhausted, hungry and not prepared for the super long queue to claim back tax! (It took at least 45 mins.) This is no fault of USJ though, the staff tried to get through the line as fast as possible but the time taken was simply due to the number of tourists. Just a heads up incase this is useful for anyone.","Written November 12, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Full day of fun,"You would need 2 days to experience everything. Son particularly enjoyed the sesame street stuff and spiderman. The harry porter world was surreal. Highly recommend that one would reserve a time ticket to enter. Went in the morning without much fuss. However, come evening, was refused entry as we did not get the time ticket. The wand was not fully utilized. Till next time, expecto patronum...","Written November 12, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Far too busy - yet they carried on letting people in,"You know you're in for a busy day when it takes 80 minutes just to get in the park entrance. Once inside the crowds just continued and there was very little respite anywhere. The theming inside is one of the best I have seen in a park, with areas to cater for all ages and tastes, and the rides are as good as you would expect from Universal - but there must be a point when they decide that there are too many people in one place, and the day we were there we went well beyond that.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,A must visit,"The place was great, specially the Harry Potter area, the butter beer is a must, the ques are very long tho, but we had the express pass so we were able to zoom right in front, it's worth the extra charge, a lot of attention is in Japanese so we weren't able to understand 70% of the shows, but it was a great experience","Written November 9, 2019"

Bought the express pass. Even though it’s quite costly, it can really save a lot of time for the rides. Harry Potter ride was the most enjoyable ride. The express pass does not allow re-entry so we went to queue for another ride. Waiting time was closed to an hour.

Minion ride was quite good too. Spider-Man ride was so-so. Quite disappointed with the terminator show.

Overall it’s an enjoyable trip, minus the rain.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Universal Studios Osaka,The theme park is fantastic the rides and shows are high tech . The Japanese staff in the venue are all highly trained and efficient.

Great day out!","Written October 27, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Best day EVER,"Today was my daughters 10th Birthday. I have patiently and methodically planned the days outing as a surprise which has been expensive and at times stressful with language barriers and pre paid tickets being absolutely compulsory.
Last week we attempted to visit Disneyland and it was sold out. Long story but could not risk that happening on my daughters birthday today.
But pre paid tickets and express passes once in Japan and without access to a printer or translator is not that easy.
Be patient. Allow yourself lots of time to read all the reviews and tips on what you need. Don’t pounce on the first ticket sale you come across. Some do not allow an upgrade if you decide to get the express pass - whereas you may have got a package to include that with the ground pass.
EXPRESS PASS IS A MUST. It’s the Business Class of Theme Park experience. Not in a conceited way but after spending biiiiig money on the bullet train and knowing it was going to be a 14hr day it was well worth being able to walk through without a queue. Ohhhhh it was well worth it!
I’m still not entirely sure exactly what I paid for as I tried to get Express into something and it didn’t count and I thought I bought the top level Express but I really only wanted to make sure we got to Harry Potter without a queue. For that you only need an express pass if you are doing the rides. Diagon Alley is open to everyone so if you only want to walk through the castle and not do the simulated ride don’t worry about an Express pass or timed entry. It only takes about 5 mins.
The staff at the park were fantastic. Well organised and friendly. My daughter had a birthday sticker we got at family services and everyone made a fuss when they spotted it.
You do have to push your way through to get photos with characters as many adults line up and as they are dressed up so attract attention and get in front of the children. We got better at that as the day went on.
Harry Potter world is great!! Definitely eat in the Hall!! What a fabulous set up.
Find your way through the shops and see if there is a sorting hat etc. we got a little rushed as it was raining and cramped.
The park is a great size to easily walk around many times in a day.
Good level of rides and attractions for younger and older children.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,fantastic,well the flip side is we went on a weekday and still FACED LONG QUES! this explains the park in one line. the rides were fantastic and thrilling. far better than Disney land in Tokyo! we loved it but only took 1 day pass - if this is how a weekday is then please take 2 day pass else the rides are going to take min 2 hours for the turn and by 7pm the main attractions close. so its hard to fit all the fun parts in 1 day,"Written October 24, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Amazing but Busy,"Great time but extremely crowded. Bought the fast track 4 for an extra £100pp (ouch !) as hate queues. But beware - worked well on H Potter - 20m instead of 1h20m. Big attraction was Flying Dinsaur, BUT... the fast track only was valid from 19.10pm, probably to keep us there all day ... turned away at 18.00 and 19.08 (!!) 15m to ride instead of 1h40m - fair improvement. The other two fast tracks were hardly worth it. Jaws was only 18m wait (single rider) and pretty much free for all entry into the massive Terminator theatre .... You pays your money you takes your choice ...","Written October 23, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Better than Disney in Tokyo!!,"We went to Universal on the last day of our Japan holiday and what a way to finish!! We had pre-booked our entrance tickets but also our fast-pass tickets noting that the fast pass tickets cost more than the park tickets themselves - but for me were totally worth it. Be reminded that if you choose to buy your fast pass tickets on the day, you will pay top wack as the prices fluctuate the closer you get to the date you want to go.....make sense?? Please carefully choose your fast pass ticket bundle - from memory, you can do bundles with 3, 4 or 7 rides. Unknowingly we selected all the top rides which was a bonus as the queue time for some of these rides (like the Flying Dinosaur) ended up being 120 mins!! Like Disney, the park itself was rammed - more so when we went as there was a Halloween special, with lots of people walking round in fancy dress. The rides are awesome. I have 3 boys (aged 13, 10 and 8) where our favorite rides were The Flying Dinosaur, Hollywood - The Ride, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey as well as the motion based 3D rides such as Spider-Man and Despicable Me. There are height restrictions on some of the roller coasters (I think min 132 cm) but my 8 year old was tall enough. We had lunch - quality was pretty good although grossly overpriced however loads of restaurants and outlets to choose from. We got to the park early and stayed for over 12 hours - yes we were knackered by the end of the day but was totally worth it! The park is well connected to the JR network with its own station which takes you back into the centre of Osaka so we had no trouble getting back to our hotel afterwards. For me, Universal was better than Disney in Tokyo, a fantastic place to have lots of fun with the kids!!",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great experience with the VIP pass,"We bought our VIP passes.
Picking up the bracelet from the 16th floor of the viewing tower was no problem. Also finding out the exact opening time of the park for tomorrow went very well (07:00 in our case).
On the day itself we were 25 minutes before this time at the meeting point Studio West entrance.
The queue at VIP was a bit shorter than at the normal entrance.
But ALL entrances were opened at the same time. The VIPs were NOT admitted earlier than the others.
Is the VIP ticket worth it? Yes, because you know the exact opening hours and can plan better how early you want to queue.
But you don't get in earlier than people with normal tickets.
For the Harry Potter world you don't have to get a time ticket in the park so early in the morning (at least not before 09:00 a.m.).
We could complete the main line at Harry Potter 3 times without queuing. It was totally worth it - a great experience!
After 09:00 the park get very full (we visited the park on a monday).","Written October 22, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Awesome tematic park,"The Harry Potter part is unbelievable! really well recreated, you can do magic! But for that you should buy a wand from the park..","Written October 22, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Overpriced, overcrowded and overrated","This place sucks. First of all, it's very overpriced. The cost of general admission is more than Disneyland, and it fails to produce the magic of that park in any way. The cost of everything inside the park is also overpriced. The food is terrible and expensive, as is all the merchandise. A normal t-shirt is 3,600 yen! Even the souvenir coins are 200 yen to make (they are 100 yen everywhere else). It's a cash grab theme park and they try and milk you for every last coin.

Secondly, it's overcrowded. We went on a Tuesday and the more popular rides still had 2 hour waiting times. You can bypass some of this by purchasing express passes, but those are over twice the cost of admission, which puts the cost at $160 per person. No thanks. Disney gives out free fast passes throughout the day; why can't this park do the same? There are queues for everything. Even getting something like ice cream or a drink is a 30 minute wait.

It was a hot day when we visited, and there is a significant lack of shade. In fact, the only real shade is at the entrance. This doesn't make any sense. Or perhaps they want all of us to sweat more so that we buy more expensive drinks?

The Harry Potter ride is good, as is the minions, but the rest is overrated. Speaking of Harry Potter, if you're hoping to purchase a wand, it will set you back 4900 yen. Butterbeer is 1300 yen with a souvenir plastic glass. Stuffed animals are 4000 yen, and any kind of clothing, well, you get the idea.","Written October 21, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Way too crowded,"Lots of interesting rides and a must go, however, unless u have an express pass Most rides are between 2-3 hours.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Q-niversal studios,"Universal studios Japan was the biggest disappointment. Lines as long as the human eye can see... for peanuts and popcorn stands! Expect to queue around 180-220 minutes for some of the bigger rides (Hollywood dream etc). Expect to wait around 4 hours to get into Harry Potter. Don’t even think about going if it’s a rainy day or you begin a game of darts where your eye is the board and the umbrella is the dart. Once we decided that the rides were too long a wait, we thought to pop into a restaurant or coffee shop to have a sit down, but this was not an option either. I’m starting to think maybe I’ve missed something and the fun is in the queuing??? Would recommend going if you’re just starting a new relationship and you want to find out the name of your potential other halves great great grandfathers dog.

Souvenir shops were so busy it was a shoplifters / pick pocketers dream. A sea of people make you feel like you’re travelling during rush hour on London’s central line, if everyone dressed up as minions to go to work.

In the 6 hours we were there, my husband and I managed to go on two rides. The Jurassic Park ride (2 hour queue) and the Spider-Man ride (over 2 hour queue... lost count of the minutes). We’re pretty fit people and in our 20’s but my husband said he felt like his feet were gonna throw up! Is this even possible? Only at Q-niversal!

We were allowed to leave with a stamp to re-enter later so we could eat something outside as it was just far too busy inside. When we returned, we had to queue AGAIN to enter! It was raining and around 5pm at this point so it was certainly not getting any quieter.

Honestly was expecting a super fun day but now that my daydreams lead to flashbacks of queues and crowds I think I’m gonna need to be treated for PTSD.","Written October 21, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Very dated and a bit flat,"My wife and I visited USJ as we had a bit of time on our hands and fancied a bit of fun. It’s quite confusing as to what is open and covered on a standard ticket. The park itself was lacking in rides and many of the attractions we went to were just a bit too dated, just like when they opened in the nineties. It’s very expensive and the atmosphere if you don’t have children is just a bit flat. I know theme parks largely cater to families but if you don’t fall into that category what’s on offer is just a bit stale.","Written October 15, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Fun, but disappointed with some arrangements","I have been to USJ for 3 times, and each time they changed some attractions which makes it very fun to go to. However, was disappointed the last time I was there when I bought express pass to go to Lupin the 3rd, but the show / game was closed and they simply assigned me to any one of the old attractions that they have. I mean this is really not a compensation if you were going to the park for that particular show / game... hope they can have some improvement in the future...","Written October 13, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Worth a visit,We went to USJ on a Monday but the park was full with visitors. Average queueing time was 60-90 minutes. Some visitors really live up to the Helloween theme and they do dressed up. Most of the rides are fantastic. I like the Harry Potter show where the castle was full with lights.,
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,One of the highlights of our trip to Japan,"We took our children (aged 6 and 8) to USJ on a Tuesday in early October and had the most wonderful day. We booked tickets online and arrived at around 11am. There were no lines for entry at that time and we went straight through. I'm glad that we didn't arrive earlier.
We had read that the lines for rides were long, so we weren't surprised that we had to wait a while for some of the attractions.
Overview of some of the rides that we went on:
- Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey: Easily the best ride that we went on.
We lined up for 35 minutes at 11:45am but we managed to ride it another three times without a queue at 6:30 pm!
- Minion Mayhem: We lined up for around 45 minutes. I thought it was pretty average and not worth the wait but the kids enjoyed it.
- Spiderman: Another crazy long wait and they hide the queue around corners. Not worth it if you have young kids.
- Jaws: Exciting little river ride during which the host pretends to shoot her gun at sharks. 6-year-old LOVED it.
-Jurassic Park Ride: Holy Moly. I was expecting a flat river ride with a few 'scary' dinosaurs and a bit of a wave at the end. I was NOT expecting the very steep ascent and rollercoaster drop that preceded that wave. EEEEEK!
- Flight of the Hippogriff: Quick little rollercoaster (long queue). Kids loved it.
- Snoopy ride: Nice for little kids- not worth waiting in a big queue for.
- Elmo Skateboard: Our kids LOVED this one. Queue was never long.
- Elmo(?) Cars: Very slow kiddy 'racing' courses. There is one for 3-5 year olds and another one for older kids. Our 6-year-old loved it.","Written October 11, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Surprisingly disappointed,"I have visited Universal Studios a few times in Orlando and was very much looking forward to my trip to USJ. Firstly we got to the park really early to get our first fast pass. We already purchased our tickets so only had one queue to stand in. The queue was massive (this was supposed to be a less crowded day!). After standing in the queue for an hour just to get in, we rushed to get our first fast pass, we then went to Harry Potter ride. One hour in and all the fast passes were gone! The queue times were 170 minutes for almost all the rides. We decided to go on some of the less popular rides hoping the queues would abate but they did not. After a few hours we wanted to leave and come back later as it was really hot and it was very crowded but were told we could not return (this rule is just stupid!!) we ended giving up and leaving anyway.

I was disappointed that you could not leave the park and come back later.","Written October 11, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Unexpectedly Good... very interesting place,"we did not expect USJ will be this good. the top 3 attractions for us are: Spiderman, Terminator, and Harry Potter ride.
the only complain is, a lot of shows are in Japanese, and they do not have English translation, difficult for foreigner to understand.
Other than that, it was an amazing day in USJ","Written October 11, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Pick the right day to go,"Everything in Japan is crowded, that's just the way Japan is. That is why I did my best to plan my Universal trip so that I could miss as much of the crowd as possible. There are estimated crowd calendars online, so I made sure to line up my visit with a day that was the least crowded (in this case it was a Tuesday in May). I also made sure to buy my ticket online and line up before Universal even opened. It probably saved me from spending a good extra hour in line.

The park was fairly quiet for a good couple hrs after I arrived, and even when it did begin to crowd it was never super overwhelming.

Because I avoided the big crowds, I had a ton of fun. It's just like the Universal park in other parts of the world with a few minor exceptions. They love minions, so minions were everywhere. Wearing cute, furry character headbands are also a big thing over here so be prepared to see quirky headwear in every gift shop. They also celebrate holidays even after the holiday is over. I went at the end of may, and yet everything was still Easter themed. Minor things like this is what makes Universal Osaka unique, and I absolutely adored it.","Written October 11, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,USJ,"Even in mid-Sep 2019, it was still crowded. Our family was there the whole day and yet we were not able to experience all the rides since some of the popular ones had 90 minute waiting times for each and no option for single rider. Still enjoyed it especially the Halloween activities. No parade or fireworks though.",

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Ridiculous prices for express passes,"Express pass tickets can easily cost 2 to 5 times the price of the regular day ticket (you still have to buy the day ticket!).

Usually you can only use an express pass one time each for a select number of rides (depending on which express pass you get). You also can’t use an express pass until the time printed next to each ride on your express pass ticket has passed. This was not clearly explained at time of purchase and does not consider when you plan to leave.

While the rides were fun and the express passes helped. I’m still not sure if it is worth paying several times more for a heavily capped express pass.","Written October 7, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Harry Potter World,"I really wanted to go to HP World, but online I found it very hard to understand the ticket system. When I went to book tickets they always said, “Harry Potter World timed ticket not included”. Then when you clicked on get timed entry it was the express pass (but a lot of different options depending on days too). I don’t love rides so didn’t need the express pass and didn’t think worth the money, but couldn’t figure out the timed entry ticket part.

In the end I understood the express pass gives 30 minute time slots to different rides, to allow them to have a select number of people and guarantee low wait times. We went on a day that was 18,000 visitors (checked an online website that predicted amount of visitors) and we waited at most 20 minutes for each ride. Obviously the 30,000 visitor days would have more wait times. Overall, Harry Potter World didn’t need an express pass or timed entry and was simple enough. We really liked the feel of it, but also of course a bit silly for adults and it’s more geared towards kids.

Would definitely recommend for Harry Potter fans, but of course much better for people who love rides. The best unexpected part was the Water World show, very cool! Would recommend the shows for adults and kids alike!","Written October 7, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Toddler Friendly,"I booked tickets prior to going to OSAKA which was a great help and relatively cheaper. I have a 3 year old that loves Jaws. So basically, that was the goal of the trip - the jaws ride. But then I also wanted to go to the Harry Potter castle and have some butterbeer. The day turned out great and we had more fun than we expected. Since, we were with a toddler, i didn't have too much expectations on the rides because we could not go on most of them with my son. But despite all that, we still had a great time. And will probably still go there if ever we're in OSAKA.","Written October 6, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Went only for Harry Potter World,We made a day of Universal but my kids are only really interested in Harry Potter - unfortunately there are only 2 rides in this sector and the hippogriff ride was an incredibly short and disappointing ride for the amount of time one had to wait! We had fast passes for the other one thank god and we enjoyed a few butter beers and spent all our money on wands etc. The rest of the place was OK I guess but not really for us and we found it very difficult to find any half edible food - I paid a ridiculous amount of money for 3 revolting cold burgers and chips and had to hustle for a table. all in all the kids enjoyed the experience and now we never have to go again!!,"Written October 6, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Great day out in Osaka,"Universal makes a great day out for families, couples or friends. Anyone who has been to the US versions will recognise a lot of the rides and attractions but that's where the similarities end. The park was predominately filled with Japanese people when we were there and the shows are all in Japanese, as are some of the rides. We didn't get a fast pass but were there at 7:15 for an 8:30 opening. As it happened, the park opened 15 mins early so we were one of the first in that weren't on the early access pass (total waste of money as they only got in 15mins ahead of us). We were able to make it to the Harry Potter attractions before the queues formed. Overall, we never waited longer than an hour for any ride and early in the day we got through the queues faster so got on some rides twice.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Fantastic fun, queues were too long.",We had an amazing day here. The absolute highlight was The Harry Potter village and ride which is just outstanding and worth the visit on it’s own. We arrived early and were able to get into the first 2 rides quite quickly (under 30 mins) but for the rest of the day the queues for the main rides at each village became really long (40-60 mins). We waited almost 2 hours to ride the Hollywood!!!! The express pass is too expensive. A suggestion to the park would be to extend the system of virtual queuing that is available in the children’s section to some of the other popular rides to alleviate queue times and allow visitors to spend more time (and money) in other attractions. For other guests I think avoid Saturdays if you can. Still fab though and we all loved it.,"Written October 5, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Way to expensive.,"We spent 2 days here and spent so much time in lines even with an express pass at a disgusting high price, trying to get issues sorted was not easy, food etc was also very expensive.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Best day at universal!,"I was really nervous about whether or not we would need to buy an express pass to go on rides. Ended up not getting one and arrived at the park at midday. Went on Tuesday 1st October and walked straight into the park and straight onto Harry Potter and the forbidden journey. After reading the reviews I was very surprised that there was no line but just a nice walk through the castle to the ride! Around this time most lines were advertising about 30 minutes but we then walked straight onto the Spider-Man ride after that. As the day went on things seemed the get busier between 3pm until about 7:30pm when times for rides went down again. Waited about 30 mins for space fantasy and then 60 minutes single rider line for the flying dinosaur. Ended up being very glad we didn't buy the express passes as only needed them on 2 rides and if we stayed from 8-9pm rather than leaving at 8pm we could have done them then. Harry Potter world is amazing and butter beer is delicious. A great day out!

Only con is the food is more expensive than regular theme parks so be ready for that.","Written October 1, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,It's worth the visit!,"Props to the warm and friendly staff at Universal Studios, Japan for ensuring the safety of the crowd while guiding and entertaining the crowd! 

Before making your way towards the Harry Potter section of Universal, you might want to check out the schedules for the 4D movie or head over to water world first (correct me if I'm wrong but they close earlier than the rest of the theme park?) before spending the rest of the afternoon sipping on butterbeer, getting your wands, having a meal, hop onto the award-winning Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ride. 

While you're there, you won't want to miss out on the parade which is worth the wait!

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Excellent,"Excellent theme park, much enjoyed my time here. Being a theme park, F&B items are going to be a bit more expensive, but it is not outrageous. I spent 3800 JPY on lunch for 2. The rest are all on you, water dispensers are available throughout the park and resting areas are plentiful.

Some tips:
Be there early: We were at the park at 0735 which was 1 hour ahead of the park opening and there were already long queues with hundreds upon hundreds of people waiting. The gates opened earlier than expected at 0810 instead of 0830 however.

Get an express pass: You will need it to avoid the crazy long queues. Queues can be extremely long at popular rides. I was a single rider on The Flying Dinosaur, entered the queue showing 35 minute wait and eventually waited slightly more than an hour. I finished the ride, looked at the queue board. Normal: 120 minutes. Single: 110 minutes. You can figure this yourself.

Consider planning a rushed start where you're moving fast and running and hitting all the big attractions/rides before the crowd comes. Then tuning down into relaxed mode once you've cleared those rides. Refer to above express pass comment. This also works in favour if you already have an express pass because you will need to make choices on what rides do you want to use your express pass on. For example, we did the Harry potter ride using express pass. We had an option of using the express pass for Jaws which was the next area, but we queued for it instead as the queue was ""only"" 30 minutes and saved the pass for Terminator.

Some ride review:
The Harry Potter ride was excellent, but one tip, lean forward and rest on the shoulder rest. I thought I wanna sit back and relax but my view was partially blocked until I leaned forward and my ride became better. It is nevertheless an excellent ride. You will need to stow your baggage in the provided lockers.

Terminator 2: 3D
This is definitely worth your time. 30 minutes of a sit-back-and-enjoy show.

Spiderman 4k
Upon reaching the end of the queue and seeing the ride, I asked myself: ""Is this recycled from Transformers?"" I didn't find this ride enjoyable not because the 3D glasses were constantly being knocked off my face from the movement and I had to hold on to it all the way, but it was really just bland for me. Transformers was much better and I really think this Spiderman is recycled from Transformers but I could be wrong.

I didn't do the Minion ride as our express pass was for a very late timing and my partner was very tired. So we left early. It's a great place to visit nevertheless albeit the expensive express pass.","Written September 29, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,The best day!,"We were almost put off going by all the negative research we read about long queues, expensive food and strategizing, but we ended up having the best day! We went on a Thursday, which I highly recommend doing if you can. The queues to enter started to build up about an hour before opening and as people went in they were literally sprinting to get to the rides. Eventually everyone calmed down when they realised the average wait for a ride was about 30 minutes. We are huge Harry Potter fans and this zone was just magical; we spent four hours there and went on the Forbidden Journey three times over the course of the day as it was just so good! We had a lot of fun casting spells around the zone with the magical versions of the wands. The food was a bit pricey, but the portions and quality were good. It was a great day out, helped enormously by going on a quieter week day I imagine. So go have fun!","Written September 29, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Highlight of my trip. Definitely not to miss!,"With all the hype and people reviewing this place, I made sure to add this to my agenda while visiting Osaka. Even though the entrance ticket and express pass was quite pricey in my opinion I thought it was worth every penny. The studio definitely had a lot to offer and we basically stayed from morning till night (solid 11 hours).

We visited USJ recently, towards the end of September. I can honestly point out that the vibe between daytime and nighttime varies greatly due to the Halloween theme it has provided.

Even though we visited USJ on a Wendesday, the place was filled with people therefore express pass became a necessity item instead of a luxury therefore be sure to purchase the tickets while you book online through Klook (which was what I did). Given the duration we stayed, we had enough time to go on all the rides / performances we wanted to go at least once (except Minion Ride). Personally, the rides I enjoyed greatly was the Flying Dinosaur (av. 120mins wait) and The Harry Potter 4K ride (av. 100mins wait), not to be mistaken with Flight of the Hippogriff. (Both of which I used the express pass to go through).

We were fortunate enough to enjoy a couple rides that were only available during the Halloween season therefore I would recommend checking their official website before hand to see which ones are available on that period. The one I couldn't enjoy was ""Biohazard™: The Extreme."" This experience provides a handful of tickets and can only be picked up by their entrance. I didn't do my homework and ultimately missed this opportunity.

After 18:00 the venue became a lot more interesting. As soon as you hear the announcement that zombies / monsters / creatures will come out as a parade, the atmosphere was spectacular. All of a sudden, the environment became hauntingly entertaining. There were live performances that involved dancing, instrumental, singing and most entertaining of all, general interaction with the public. If you're looking to visit USJ, I highly recommend coming during the Halloween season!

Last but not least, I will share some parade photos only since it is not always available.",

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Best universal studio experience!,"Well, as we do have a Universal Studio in Sentosa (and we had annual pass), which is just a 30-min-drive away from home, we looked forward to something unique in Universal Studio Japan, and they nailed it!

Of course we don't have Harry Potter and Minion rides in Singapore, but the real differentiator is the attention to ""customer experience"" in every single detail. I will not go into details as I don't want to turn this review into a ""design thinking"" analysis. You just need to be there to experience it.

It is highly recommended to get the express pass (although it is rather expensive). They do not have one single express pass for everything. Instead, they have a set of express passes you can choose. It looks complicated at first glance but is actually very easy to understand once you read a bit more. You should study the options a bit and choose the most suitable one according to your plan and interests.

The only thing I think can be better is that, they do not sell tickets and express pass in their website. Instead their website provides the link to authorized 3rd party agency for you to buy tickets online. This additional layer caused me a bit problem: in fact the express pass does not include the one day pass for you to enter the park first. However, the 3rd party agency website doesn't highlight this to me when I purchased the express pass. Even worse, they told me the express pass is ""direct in"" (turned out it means it is ""direct in"" for the ride, not for the park entrance). We had to re-queue at the ticket office to buy the one day pass when we were there.","Written September 27, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Amazing afternoon out!,"(English couple from London) My partner and I are mid-twenties and from London.

It is ten times more magical than Disney here and you do not need Express Passes so no need to overspend. This was the perfect ending to our holiday. It doesn’t make a difference that everything was in Japanese, the rollercoasters were incredible. We rode in single passengers where possible. There was no queues in Harry Potter at all and we got straight on those rides at 20:30. Bring some snacks and you won’t have to spend a penny here!

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Bigger than expected!,"We spent the whole day here and still couldn’t get through everything. The place was so much bigger than expected!

Like all theme parks, you need to be prepared to wait, otherwise pay extra for the express pass. Here are a few tips:
- plan where you want to go and stick to it!
- get there early for the Harry Potter ride. Hogwarts castle was awesome
- Don’t bother with Curious George
- Get the unlimited drinks pass. That allows you unlimited soft drinks and coffee at 7 different restaurants. I bought just one for the whole family :).
- go there when the weather is cooler because there’s not much shelter outside

The place was super clean and like every else in Japan , everyone was courteous and friendly. So if you and your family are the patient type, you’ll have a great time here.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,"Fantastic Day Out, Large Rides Busy but Plenty of other things to do","We have visited Universal Studios in Florida many times so it was slightly nostalgic to be visiting an almost identical layout in a foreign country. The newly opened Minions Park Area was brilliant much larger than that in the USA. We were there on what was classed as a quiet day so didnt bother with the express pass which can be very expensive. We managed most of the rides within 5-10 mins using the available single rider queues. Lines for Harry Potter and the larger coasters were in the 60 min range and due to a thunderstorm unfortunately these closed down for a period so we missed out doing these. You can choose to just do the Castle walkthrough for Harry Potter if you dont want to ride the Forbidden Journey. Jurassic Park, Spider Man, Jaws and Minions we all managed twice. I would highly recomment the WaterWorld stunt show too it was great to watch even if you didnt understand Japanese. Lots of dining options including Mels Diner although I would advise booking if you want any of the themed restuarants the queue for the Happiness Cafe was over an hour long at lunchtime. Lots of different merchandise to choose from too. Very easy transportation from the Centre of Osaka we took the Universal City Train to the station and it was literally a 5 min walk into City Walk and then the park. Great Day all round. Once you leave the park you cannot re-enter so I would advise eating beforehand as it can be pricy inside and then head to City Walk on your way home.","Written September 25, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,You don't need the express pass,"Decided last minute to come here as a couple. Bought tickets at the entrance at face value 7400 plus tax (per person). Considered getting the express pass but the dealers online were trying to sell them at 4x face value (roughly 4xx USD per person). Decided not to get them as I found the idea of spending close to 800 USD on going to Universal for 1 day absolutely absurd. I was just at Universal in Orlando and purchased the express pass at face value.

At this particular park, you can ride as a single person and the wait is usually about 20 minutes per ride. My partner and I did this for every ride except Minions which doesn't offer this service. For example, the Harry Potter ride had a huge line and the wait time was 70 plus minutes. We went on the singles line, together, and we were on the ride in 15 minutes. Same thing with Spiderman although the wait time was roughly 40 minutes compared to 70 for the normal line. Most of the other rides were 10 to 20 minutes on the singles line. The two rollercoasters had long lines on both the normal line and the singles line. The lady hates rollercoasters so I never had the chance to ride them.

We arrived at 10am although it took 1 hour to buy a ticket and enter the park. If we arrived at 8am like the other guests, we easily would have been able to do every ride here and watch several of the shows. On September 30th, there were quite a few people as the local schools were closed due to some kind've sports event. So the place was packed.

The express pass is obviously better but if you are with a group of friends / couple, you could still do everything if you use our strategy.

Go to guest services when you arrive and find out which rides you can sign up for. We signed up for the new ride based on resident evil and only waited a few minutes because of this ticket.

Area 51 is easily the most underrated attraction at the park. Line is only 20 to 30 minutes and the actual ""ride"" is close to 30 minutes. May not be suitable for young children.

I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars due to the food situation. 99% of the food is pretty unhealthy and you have to wait in long lines just to get something to eat. I am positive this is done intentionally to force the customer to wait in cue to eat to relieve pressure off of the lines at the main attractions. It took over 20 minutes just to get a hot dog. While universal could hire more people or have more food carts, it is obvious that they have chose to inconvenience the customer for their own benefit. Also if you are Jewish, Muslim, a vegetarian, have celiac disease or some other kind of food allergy, you aren't going to be happy here. Don't expect any Kosher, Halal, vegan, gluten free, etc. at most places. The Universal studios in Florida does a pretty decent job labeling the food in the markets but I didn't see that here. Perhaps I didn't investigate it enough. Would give it 5 stars if they were able to address this but I doubt that will happen. There's nothing worse than spending all this money and then being told you cannot bring outside food into the park, especially if you have legitimate concerns. Perhaps universal can just charge a self serve fee but again I am just dreaming.

Also more bathrooms would be nice. Had to wait in line for that as well...","Written September 30, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Whole day of fun.,Provided whole day of fun for the whole family. It’s a shame that the Express Pass are more expensive than the actual entrance ticket.,"Written September 30, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Excellent,"Excellent theme park, much enjoyed my time here. Being a theme park, F&B items are going to be a bit more expensive, but it is not outrageous. I spent 3800 JPY on lunch for 2. The rest are all on you, water dispensers are available throughout the park and resting areas are plentiful.

Some tips:
Be there early: We were at the park at 0735 which was 1 hour ahead of the park opening and there were already long queues with hundreds upon hundreds of people waiting. The gates opened earlier than expected at 0810 instead of 0830 however.

Get an express pass: You will need it to avoid the crazy long queues. Queues can be extremely long at popular rides. I was a single rider on The Flying Dinosaur, entered the queue showing 35 minute wait and eventually waited slightly more than an hour. I finished the ride, looked at the queue board. Normal: 120 minutes. Single: 110 minutes. You can figure this yourself.

Consider planning a rushed start where you're moving fast and running and hitting all the big attractions/rides before the crowd comes. Then tuning down into relaxed mode once you've cleared those rides. Refer to above express pass comment. This also works in favour if you already have an express pass because you will need to make choices on what rides do you want to use your express pass on. For example, we did the Harry potter ride using express pass. We had an option of using the express pass for Jaws which was the next area, but we queued for it instead as the queue was ""only"" 30 minutes and saved the pass for Terminator.

Some ride review:
The Harry Potter ride was excellent, but one tip, lean forward and rest on the shoulder rest. I thought I wanna sit back and relax but my view was partially blocked until I leaned forward and my ride became better. It is nevertheless an excellent ride. You will need to stow your baggage in the provided lockers.

Terminator 2: 3D
This is definitely worth your time. 30 minutes of a sit-back-and-enjoy show.

Spiderman 4k
Upon reaching the end of the queue and seeing the ride, I asked myself: ""Is this recycled from Transformers?"" I didn't find this ride enjoyable not because the 3D glasses were constantly being knocked off my face from the movement and I had to hold on to it all the way, but it was really just bland for me. Transformers was much better and I really think this Spiderman is recycled from Transformers but I could be wrong.

I didn't do the Minion ride as our express pass was for a very late timing and my partner was very tired. So we left early. It's a great place to visit nevertheless albeit the expensive express pass.","Written September 29, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,The best day!,"We were almost put off going by all the negative research we read about long queues, expensive food and strategizing, but we ended up having the best day! We went on a Thursday, which I highly recommend doing if you can. The queues to enter started to build up about an hour before opening and as people went in they were literally sprinting to get to the rides. Eventually everyone calmed down when they realised the average wait for a ride was about 30 minutes. We are huge Harry Potter fans and this zone was just magical; we spent four hours there and went on the Forbidden Journey three times over the course of the day as it was just so good! We had a lot of fun casting spells around the zone with the magical versions of the wands. The food was a bit pricey, but the portions and quality were good. It was a great day out, helped enormously by going on a quieter week day I imagine. So go have fun!","Written September 29, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Highlight of my trip. Definitely not to miss!,"With all the hype and people reviewing this place, I made sure to add this to my agenda while visiting Osaka. Even though the entrance ticket and express pass was quite pricey in my opinion I thought it was worth every penny. The studio definitely had a lot to offer and we basically stayed from morning till night (solid 11 hours).

We visited USJ recently, towards the end of September. I can honestly point out that the vibe between daytime and nighttime varies greatly due to the Halloween theme it has provided.

Even though we visited USJ on a Wendesday, the place was filled with people therefore express pass became a necessity item instead of a luxury therefore be sure to purchase the tickets while you book online through Klook (which was what I did). Given the duration we stayed, we had enough time to go on all the rides / performances we wanted to go at least once (except Minion Ride). Personally, the rides I enjoyed greatly was the Flying Dinosaur (av. 120mins wait) and The Harry Potter 4K ride (av. 100mins wait), not to be mistaken with Flight of the Hippogriff. (Both of which I used the express pass to go through).

We were fortunate enough to enjoy a couple rides that were only available during the Halloween season therefore I would recommend checking their official website before hand to see which ones are available on that period. The one I couldn't enjoy was ""Biohazard™: The Extreme."" This experience provides a handful of tickets and can only be picked up by their entrance. I didn't do my homework and ultimately missed this opportunity.

After 18:00 the venue became a lot more interesting. As soon as you hear the announcement that zombies / monsters / creatures will come out as a parade, the atmosphere was spectacular. All of a sudden, the environment became hauntingly entertaining. There were live performances that involved dancing, instrumental, singing and most entertaining of all, general interaction with the public. If you're looking to visit USJ, I highly recommend coming during the Halloween season!

Last but not least, I will share some parade photos only since it is not always available.",

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Prepare to queue!,"We visited in early September, midweek and apparently outside of school holidays but still packed especially with local teenagers. Long queues for popular rides especially Harry Potter Forbidden Journey and Jurassic Park Flying Dinosaur. Within half hour of opening the Harry Potter ride had a 2hr wait. Its probably worth considering the Express Pass if you’re particularly keen on these more popular rides (although it then makes it a pretty expensive day).
The Flying Dinosaur ride was closed for unscheduled maintenance, poor communication around if/when it would reopen was frustrating (“come back in 30mins for update” - it was shut for over 2hrs).
There’s limited shade for many of the queues so take hat/fan/sunscreen for hot summer days.
Some of the rides are showing their age (e.g. Jaws, Terminator 3D). All shows are in Japanese only, obviously harder to follow if you don’t speak the language but the action is still entertaining.
Hollywood Dream was good, Jurassic Park The Ride, Space Fantasy and Spider-Man were also worth doing. With hindsight we probably wouldn’t bother with the Flight of the Hippogriff or the Terminator show.
For most rides you can cut wait times considerably by taking the single rider queue. In some cases our wait time was reduced by 30mins or more and sometimes we got on the same ride together anyway.
Waterworld show was much better than Terminator (partly because the latter started >30mins later than scheduled, for no apparent reason).
Plenty of food offerings but what we saw looked pricey and not particularly appetizing, long queues around lunchtime and hard to find a table too. We had a big breakfast before we went then made it through the day with drinks bought from vending machines.",

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,TWILIGHT TICKET,"BEST NIGHT EVER: Was a bit hesitant about USJ after Disneyland and the INSANE crowds....

We did this! Slightly cheaper, We skipped the insane heat, we skipped the crowds. Longest wait times for Minion Mayhem-and that was only 30 minutes. Jaws was a 20 minute wait, The Amazing Spider-Man was 20 minutes and the Jurassic Park ride, my partner walked straight in.
If there is just one person riding, we’d definitely recommend the single rider queue. Come 7.30/8 you can pretty much walk straight on in.
I’m surprised we got so many “popular” rides in, we had a sick time, and the Hogwarts Light show shouldn’t be missed!",

There are so many attractions in so many different parts of the park it is a non stop adventure. They even had a whole section for my 2 year old, then the other for the older kids as well. They have an all you can drink deal in restaurant which allows you to enjoy a cold beverage or a hot coffee at all times of the day while you are there. The shows are top notch, and they have so many the wait times are at a minimum.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Couldn't access Wizarding World,"I flew all the way to Japan to see the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. However, AFTER paying full price tickets and entering the park, there was a sign saying Harry Potter world is full and can only be accessed via a lottery ticket. I queued with hundreds of people and nobody won the HP lottery.
This should have been told to us BEFORE entering the park, ideally at the time of buying the tickets as HP was my only reason for going. Instead, they take customers' money and then forbid them from seeing most of the park. I've honestly never been so disappointed. Terrible problem with overcrowding and even worse way of dealing with it. Staff was rude, and told us literally to ""go away"" when we asked if there was any other way to access HP world that day. (e.g. buying an extra pass).
It's theft tbh as they refused to provide a service I paid a lot for, through no fault of my own.","Written September 3, 2019"

Rides also arnt made for chubby people.
My fav part of the day though was the Terminator 2 3D/4d movie. Even though it was in Japanese it was still great to watch.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,A wonderful theme park for everyone,"I really like this theme park, you can many young and elderly here. Service is good and staffs are very friendly and cheerful.
By your round trip train tickets before to avoid long queue.
There are lugguage storages and regular lockers inside the park. Use the one inside is recommended.
If money is not your concern or if you only have limited time to stay inside the park, get priority tickets instead as queuing time can be over 1 hour. But they let elderly and handicapped people to go first without getting priority tickets.
Read the time table of performance to avoid disappointment. They have light parade which you should f miss.
We had fun here and we will back if we come to Osaka again.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Theme park,The theme park seemed dated with attractions from movies now quite a few years old. The express pass was over priced for what you get out of it.,"Written August 31, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Not my thing. I think it is much too costly for value.,"I went there to hang out with some friends and because it is very famous.
Some 4D movies (we saw ~2 of them) and a water live show were really good;

I bought a basic adult ticket for 9000¥ (10000¥/90€, including transport to get there) which I find it very expensive though: long queueing times, everything (except fairground attractions included in ticket and the toilets) lead to spend more money: not just toys or food but practical things I would have expected to be free, eg. I had to charge my phone (my mistake). For that I had to go to some machines that make you pay, and that were not easy to find. charging it to 40% cost me 600¥ (6€).

But for those who like theme parks like this, a simple tip. Worth going when it’s raining because there are fewer people and queuing time is much shorter.","Written August 29, 2019"

A couple of surprises - Only one park - i have become used to two parks in Orlando. i was able to get to everything i wanted in one day - it helped that i had the Express Pass - though it still limited the use to one per ride (another surprise). Okay - last thought and i know i only speak English - some subtitles would have been greatly appreciated - many times i was watching a film or show that only had Japanese. i believe it would be a lot more fun (and understandable) if i could have had some English.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Expensive but fun day out,"If you've visited any of the other Universal parks then you know what to expect here. Universal Japan has all the same rides, but you must buy the fast pass if you want to get on the most popular, otherwise expect to queue for up to two hours (which is no fun in 40 degrees). The park does feel very Japanese despite all the US trappings - it's spotlessly clean, the rides/parades/food stalls are staffed by super polite and efficient people and because it's visited by Japanese people in the main, it seems much calmer than most other theme parks we've visited. Try to eat outside of the usual lunch and dinner slots to avoid the crowds and take snacks (although there are numerous places to eat they are far more expensive then anything else we came across in our trip to Japan). It's a great day out and the park seemed to clear by about 6.30pm so consider coming later in the day if you want to get on more rides. The night time parade was our favourite and well worth staying for - check notice boards for timings. One last thing is that wifi is almost non existent, so use the paper map to get around rather than any app you might have heard about and check ride height restrictions in advance if you're travelling with children.","Written August 26, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Must buy the express pass!,We bought our tickets and express pass 7 on klook and enjoyed a day of hassle-free and queue-skipping rides! The express pass allowed us to zip through the 60-130 min queues for the valid attractions! One tip is to use the express pass for Hollywood Dream -The Ride instead of Backdraft as Backdraft accomodates a large number of people in one go! We were able to take most major and popular rides before the night even hit! Get the express pass if you can!,
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Liked it more than I thought I would!,"The interenet gives you access to knowledge like never before and my kid is proof of this! She saw one brochure at a travel show and from there it was Disney this, Unversal that. We'd agreed to go to one of the major theme parks and although we would later stay between the two Disney parks in Tokyo, we had a preference for Universal Studios. This visit may have been for our daughter, but we still had to deal with it and Universal appealed to both of us more.
You'll find Universal Studios towards the Harbour, a few stops down from Osaka station on the Yumesaki line. The stop you want is actualy called Universal City and is not right on the park, but a short walk through numerous resturaunts, bars and hotels. As we arrived, station staff were advising that visitors purchase return tickets immediately to avoid long queues. Do this! You won't regret it.
The park entrance is an open plaza with ticket booth, entry and lockers to the left and the Universal globe and fountain to the right for selfies. Another great tip here is that there are luggage lockers and toilets before the entry and there are also lockers once inside the park. Use the ones inside the park as once you leave the park, there is no re-entry. Seems a bit unfair but it's their park, thier rules. Entry for two adults and one child cost us around AUD$300. That includes standard rides in the regular queue. In hindsight, we shoud have chosen the Priority line tickets, as queues were as long as 90 minutes for some attractions. We also noted that some of those times were overstated, or the number of riders had reduced and the wait-time hadn't been changed. We had entered the park around 2pm on a wet day and it was still really busy. The park itself is broken up into serveral themed areas and you should make yourself aware of these with the park map or before you go. Some of these may just not be of interest, such as the Americana area was not interesting to us. The minions area was smashed with visitors and looong wait times and we nded up wandering to the Jurasic park area and onto the boat ride. Queue time stated 45 mins but it took us about 28 mins and we got to the front of the boat. Way cool! BTW, buy the overpriced 400yen plastic poncho from the vending machine. Those things served us for the whole day and were essential at the front of the boat! This is a fun ride. We did get stuck on one part for about 15 mins and a dinosaur peed in my ear, my daughter's favourite part of the ride, and it was really fun. Just wish I knew where the camera was as the Japanese father next to us popped a dab at the right time and made a very cool photo souvenir! As the lttle one was mostly too little for the really fun rides, we took her to snoopy land and the other kids areas. Just beware that some of these shut down their kids rides at 4pm, leaving you with one grumpy kid. But don't worry, there's plenty of other rides for them that are still going. Even the waterworld attraction shut early. For us, the best part was Harry Potter world. By 4pm, queues are shrinking and so are the crowds so 20 mins or less is the average wait times we found. Do the ride in Hogwarts, no I'm not going to spoil it, but just don't do the Butter Beer beforehand. It tastes alright but that stuf comes back to haunt you! I have to say that HP world make the visit for us. It's well planned and executed and presents realistic worl at twilight.
As we wandered towards the gate, I told the family I was going to do one decent scary coaster ride, with or without them. That was the Flying Dinosaur ride. I got on the car with three quite young Japanese guys I didn't know, we screamed and laughed our guts out, and got off to high-fives and the new found bortherhood of the Flying Dinosaur. Brilliant!!
It's hard to write about leaving as everything now had a dull taste to it. Good thing we had already bouth our return tickets! Now for a 39 min ride home to Kyoto...
Basically, go a little later, buy your return train tickets when you arrive, buy the priority tickets, use the lockers indise the park and have fun. When we tought about it, this was better entertainement value that a day at the Sydney Easter Show.","Written August 24, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Long waits,"While some of the rides were thrilling the waits were simply too long. Up to 75 minutes wait for a ride that was only a few minutes long. Given the summer heat, the waits were almost unbearable.

Also we had purchased express passes for some of the rides but my teenage children could not use the passes as they were above the size limit for those rides. We were not informed of the size limit at the time we purchased the express passes at the counter.

Some of the rides such as Jaws were simply outdated.","Written August 23, 2019"
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,A wonderful 2-days in USJ!,"This is a detailed review and ideally I would have given a score of 4.5, as there are some issues. Ultimately my journey in USJ was so wonderful at the end that it is a very personal, 5-star rating.

First of all, I strongly recommend the 2-day pass (not express). If you're tight for time during your Japan stay, you can go for the 1-day express. My friend and I did a lot in 1-day without express (8:30-20:00), but it is impossible to do all of it without express. However, the reason I recommend 2-days is because, for me personally, my time in USJ felt like a lifetime. To be able to return for the second day really enhances your experience.

Second, definitely arrive early. I won't guarantee any gimmies if you do, because even at 8:30 there was a 50+ minute wait for the minion ride, which appeared to be the most popular ride during our 2-day visit. Though this is preferable to the 120 minutes wait during the day. Also, try to stay until the end. The park has a different feel at the night-time; looks beautiful; and when you reflect on the 12+ hours that have passed, you really do feel like you're a part of the place.

Third, beware of lunchtime! This is a big complaint that I have in USJ. Waiting for rides is one thing, but you can overcome this with a phone and battery bank, or a nintendo DS/handheld console. Waiting for food is, in my opinion, not acceptable. This is something they definitely need to address. We were there at the beginning of August, so lunchtime isn't just about eating, it's about shelter. You can smuggle in a couple sandwiches in the bottom of a deep bag, but in the end, you'll need a bite to eat at some point, and if you're doing a 8:30-20:00 stay, you're going to need a rest! I can't offer tips here, the diners were jam-packed anytime between 12:00-15:00. I'll I can say is - expect it.

Fourth and finally, do as much as possible! If you do the 2-days, definitely watch some of the parades, the water shows (minions and the stunt Waterworld show). Mix it up a little! The rides are fun, but there's plenty other attractions on offer. Some attractions are intended for kids and family, but the adults will still enjoy those attractions to!

Overall, in my 25-day trip across Japan, the 2 days spent in Osaka's Universal Studios Japan, is one of my favourite memories!","Written August 23, 2019"

If you only have limited time, can buy Universal Express Pass tickets which is super expensive. With this ticket a special queue line will be available.

Access to USJ with JR Osaka Loop Line stops at Nishikujo Station and then go with JR Yumisaki Line about 5 minutes to Universal City Station.",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Family Day Out,"We spent the whole day at the park (12 hours) with our 2 daughters, had a great time, enjoying the rides at the different worlds and especially Harry Potter world. Language was not an issue for non Japanese speakers, however the queues for the rides were very long and therefore if you can afford the Express Passes they are worth it but very expensive.

Transport to the park was easy and we got to the park within 20 minutes form the center of Osaka. My biggest grip was there were very few bins around the park and you had to queue for everything from water at the vending machines to food at both restaurants and popup counters. Also there were very few places to get anything other than beer if you wanted an alcoholic drink.","Written August 14, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Good experience,"Been to Universal studio in the Month of Aug, it was raining and climate was pleasant.
Expect your bag to be frisked at the entrance due security reasons and you are not supposed to carry outside food. However there are plenty of staff and all carrying broad broad smile. Within no time you will find yourself inside the park.
It will be highly recommended to go for fast track pass unless you are willing to be in queue for minimum of 30+ plus minutes for many of the rides. I been there on weekend and expect the same on weekends and public holidays.
Rides are great but many of the shows that you get to see are purely in Japanese language.
Food is no big deal and there are plenty of joints. For those seeking veg food only veg pizza is available in certain joints.
Stay in the park till the end and your visit is incomplete till you witness bright, colourfull wonderful, Parade towards the park closing hours.","Written August 8, 2019"

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Amazing day but 2 rude staff spoilt the experience,"Family group of 7 - 6 adults and an 11 year old. A truly amazing experience despite the language barrier. We enjoyed the shows where very little English is spoken - but that’s ok - we’re in Japan after all. However, two members of staff on the Hollywood Dream ride had the potential to ruin the whole day. Two separate incidents too. Four of us decided to do the singles line to speed things up. My 11yo daughter was fine with this and is a chilled kid. We decided that she’d go in the middle so an adult could be waiting for her. As she placed her bag in the locker at the side she was told she couldn’t and then directed to a full locker. Confused as she couldn’t see where to put her bag - she was shouted at. She then was instructed to put the bag where she was originally going to. She then got told to take something off her head. As she wasn’t wearing anything except a braid that is part of her hair (plaited in and tied back) she again was confused. She was shouted at again by this staff member- she left the ride quite upset.

Same ride - I was asked by a number of staff to remove a bandana prior to the ride. Having been on a previous one I was expecting this. I stated I would remove it at the bag locker and at least 3 staff members smiled and accepted this. I lost all my hair following treatment- it’s not a fashion statement- my hair has grown back super curly and is at a stage where it’s in between. I’m self conscious of this - but I also accept their rules. One staff member would not accept that I would take it off when I put the bag and other belongings that were still in my hand in the locker. He demanded I take it off there and then. I was still in the queue. I was so upset I completed the ride choking back tears.

We be tried to contact the park directly but as I’m not able to felt that it would be part of my review. Such a shame as other members of staff were amazing - server in Harry Potter world for example.

Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Pleasantly surprise but as expected not the cheapest,"Wasn't even on the 'maybe' list of things to do in Japan but so glad we went! Despite teaming with visitors the hospitality second to none! Haven't been to any similar but thought the attention to detail was second to none and as an adult there were a couple fantastic rides. We forked out for the express pass so not 100% sure whether standing in hour long cues would have rated such a positive review so def look at those if you can. If you are willing, the singles' cues are a great option for cutting time in the line if you are willing to go separately...HEAPS of movie trinkets to buy and loved my minion burger lol",
Japan,Universal Studios Japan,Just Superb !,"We went there as a family in golden week. It was very very crowded as expected but they somehow seem to have managed huge crowds superbly. We purchased express pass (which is very different from express pass in Disney).
The queues for small kids rides was much less so we were able to attend lot of rides there. The big rides had lot of queues (more than 2 hours) so unless you have express it gets tough.
This park is much more open than Disney so you don't feel that crowded. The eating options were also many here.","Written August 17, 2019"

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Mesmerizing,"The temple and the tori gates are amazing. While you have to deal with the crowds (based on the time of day you visit) which can take the charm away from this place, if you are patient and let the large groups pass you, you can enjoy it even more. Last part of the walk is a bit steep but nothing major. Must see and worth the visit","Written November 3, 2021"
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,One of my Favorites!,"The Fushimi Inari Shrine was probably my favorite one in Kyoto. It is a bit out of the way compared to some of the others, but well worth it. I rented bikes in Kyoto and there was a nice trail leading to the area. This shrine was so much fun to explore and it was massive. You can literally spend a half day here wandering the shrine and hiking. Of course, the highlight is the thousand Torri Gates. You can get incredible photos here. This shrine tends to get crowded even early in the day. I can't imagine what it is like during the height of tourist season.","Written September 17, 2021"
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Favorite part of our trip!,"This was by far my favorite attraction during the whole trip. Well as far as temples are concerned. Be prepared for a nice hike as it’s 12,00 steps to the top of Mt. Anari that whole place is just so stunning though.",
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,My favorite place in the whole of Kyoto,I love mountain hiking and this is the perfect place we go up in the mountain and see the beautiful Tory gates in the middle of the forest there are a lot of tourist but when you climb in above the mountain you will find yourself alone and you will be able to feel the holiness of the place,"Written September 1, 2021"
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Mesmerizing experience,"One of my favorites in Japan trip is this temple with hundreds of Inaris all along the hill taking you uptop. There are multiple stops along the way so you can plan where to stop and return instead of going all the way.

The walk up is not difficult and there are plenty of stopping points to take in the views and surroundings. We went very early just before 07:00hrs to avoid the crowds, which worked a treat. As you go to leave the shrine keep to the right and you pass a school and come to a lovely cafe on the side of a pond. We had breakfast here which was lovely.","Written August 14, 2021"

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,13 May 2017 visit Fushimi-Inari Temple in Japan,"""Fushimi Inari Taisha (伏見稲荷大社) is the head shrine of Inari, located in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, Japan. The shrine sits at the base of a mountain also named Inari which is 233 metres above sea level, and includes trails up the mountain to many smaller shrines which span 4 kilometers and takes approximately 2 hours to walk up.

Since early Japan, Inari was seen as the patron of business, and merchants and manufacturers have traditionally worshipped Inari. Each of the torii at Fushimi Inari Taisha is donated by a Japanese business. First and foremost, though, Inari is the god of rice.

This popular shrine is said to have as many as 32,000 sub-shrines (bunsha (分社)) throughout Japan."" ⛩⛩⛩","Written August 6, 2021"

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Fit,There are thousands of stairs. You better be fit when you get here to visit. The place is enchanting. But very tiring.,
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,You do not climb for views,"You ought to get good views from the top. Not s! The views from midway are way better. No point climbing those steepe stairs. If you are hard-on walking, do not even think of coming here.",
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Unmatched Experience!,"The numerous Tori gates set the scene and create a visual experience that ALMOST makes you forget that you are climbing up a mountain (a tall one too!). All the way up and some of the way down these Tori gates are lined up for your visual pleasure. There were many mini-shrines as you ascend the mountain and different spots to get a bite to eat or get something to drink.

Be prepared for a 2-3 hr excursion just for the hike through all the toriis - climb the stairs & hike through over a thousand vermilion torii shrine gates to the summit of sacred Mt Inari. Descend back to the Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine. We took frequent rest breaks while hiking upward. There are quite a few shops (for drinks, food, souvenirs, ice cream, etc), vending machines but maybe only 2 restroom areas along the hike. Best to get to the shrine & start the climb as early in the morning as possible...you’ll get wonderful photos before the crowds come. Majority of people wore masks for COVID precautions.",

we went away and had a quiet lunch off the bust streets.
then back we went.
muscled our way through the culinary gauntlet.
mad chaos is how it felt.
i had no idea when i choose to come here how busy it would be.
i'd seen pics of the colourful tori and wanted to see them.
we got carried along and entered the rows of tori, senbon and walked a bit and my husband said no more.
i managed to step out and snap a few pics with out folks in them.
and then we left.
the temple sits at the base of the inari mountain and there are numerous trails and small shrines that can be explored over a couple of hours.
there are 1000 tori, each one donated by a japanese business.

Foxes were seen as Inari's messengers and there are statues of them everywhere! Behind the Shrine you will find the tens of thousands of famous Torii gates. All donated by private individuals and companies whose names and dates are written on the Torii gate they have donated.

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Thousands of Torii Gates,"We came here on the afternoon of our first day in Kyoto and found this to be the most fascinating shrine that we visited during our two weeks in Japan. Dedicated to the Shinto God of Rice, Inari, the shrine features thousands of densely packed torii gates that provide a covered path up the mountainside. As we had limited time and it takes from 2-to-3 hours for a round-trip to the summit, we decided to hike for about 45 minutes and then return.

A stream of tourists joined us for the climb, many hindering our pace by posing for photos, which required us to stop and wait. Some of the gates, which are vermilion with black at the bottom, proved to be in bad condition with chunks of wood missing. In a few places, a pole had been removed for restoration. Small restaurants and souvenir stands appeared occasionally outside the pathway, along with viewpoints. Signs unexpectedly warned about the danger of monkeys and boars, but we never saw any animals except a domestic cat sitting on a tree stump.

Back at ground level, a wave of tourists poured toward us to begin the ascent. Many of them seemed to be with tour groups. None stopped to look at the shrine's main hall and Romon Gate here. They also ignored the statues of foxes, which reflect the belief that the animal is an Inari messenger.

The shrine is always open and no admission is charged. I think early morning would be a far better time to come than the afternoon when the area has a huge tourist volume. We got here via the Keihan Main Line, which has a Fushimi-Inari station., and then walked for about four minutes to reach the shrine.","Written September 28, 2020"

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Entering to a Magical World through Torii Gates,"We visited Fushimi Inari Shrine in the afternoon and the grand entrance from Senbon Torii was like entering a magical world. We enjoyed hiking through the thousands of bright red torii gates. There were many fox statues along the path, which regarded as the messengers and guardian spirits of the Inari Shrines. The whole pathway is torii-covered along the loop to the top of the mountain and it took around 2 hours to reach the summit. It was a truly mesmerizing experience. The path went through passing restaurants, viewpoints, and smaller shrines along the way to the top of the hill. We could get some brilliant images of torii gates without other people in them. The view of the sunset at the top of the hill made an everlasting memory and this was one of the amazing journeys we encountered in Kyoto.","Written June 22, 2020"

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Bring your climbing shoes,"Even with the crowds, and yes there probably will be crowds, at least at the base of the shrine, the Fushimi Inari experience is quite magical. What makes the Japanese shrines so interesting is the active participation that still goes on today, and that you can be a part of it after learning the proper protocol. The gates did not disappoint. And while I thought there were only several rows of them, turns out there’s a whole mountain of them! And what a climb it was. It definitely was a hike up a mountain, but truly worth it once we reached the summit. Just bring a bottle of water, take your time, wear comfortable shoes for walking up steps, and you can do it! Definitely worth summiting if you have the chance. But if you don’t feel like hiking, there are plenty of gates to walk through at the base of the shrine. Just know the higher you go, the less people there are to take in the magic of the mountain.",
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Get past the crowds!,"To get the best experience here, I'd highly suggest hiking up to the summit and back. You'll escape the insane crowds at the base, and find yourself having a very peaceful walk through this beautiful shrine.

We arrived late in the afternoon and had to almost sprint up the hill as the evening darkness closed in on us, but then the lights come on giving the pathway a surreal air as the light casts its shadows through the Tori Gates.

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,A wonderful place to visit but go early and prepared for a good walk,"The Fushimin Inari-Taisha Shrine lived up to expectations but as one of the more famous sights in Japan we thought we should try to avoid the crowds by going early so we got an early train from Kyoto and aimed to get there around 7am. If you decide to visit I would strongly recommend you do the same because it was worth the early start.

The start of the complex is only a short walk from the rail station and begins with the large and very obvious shrines of Fushimi Inari-taisha. The temptation was to stop here and start exploring but the goal was to walk up the hill on the 4km path through a seemingly endless procession of bright red vermilion Tori gates so we headed to the left of the large shrine at the entrance and began our ascent up to and through the gates.

It is a beautiful place and a wonder through a camera viewfinder but finding a stretch without a stranger in the frame was only possible because we went early and the difference when we were making our way down was amazing. The people who set off only an hour or so after us had almost no chance to see it as we had and as it appears in the travel guides and by mid morning it had become a tunnel of people.

The shrine was originally dedicated by the Hata family in the 8th Century and the bright vermilion tori have been erected and dedicated by individuals and communities over a long period. As you begin to walk through them look back and you will see the black painted dedications on the side facing up the slopes of Inari-san.

There are plenty of small shrines and four or five larger shrines along the route often with stone foxes that people have occasionally adorned with small bright neck scarves and others are thronged with a multitude of miniature foxes arranged in ranks and offering great photographic opportunities. The fox is thought to be a messenger to the god and where you see one apparently carrying a key this is symbolic of the key to a rice granary.

The track itself comes to form a loop so staying on what looks like the main route will eventually lead you back to a spot you recall from the journey up. We only encountered one real side track and it was fortunately very short. On the other hand what isn't so obvious is the top!

There is a large shrine of clustered stone monuments at the summit and shortly beyond it you will find you are consistently descending. We first thought we had simply passed over a ridge on the way up and carried on a little way passing a few people who had clearly done the same thing and had turned to make their way back up, something we did a few minutes later.

Our visit to the larger shrine near the entrance waited until the end and by then it had already attracted crowds but we were in no doubt that to appreciate not only the long tori enclosed track up the hillside but something of the peaceful atmosphere and the freshness of the early morning here made our early start a really good decision.

If you do the same though it would be worthwhile taking both a bottle of water and some kind of light snack to eat along the way. There are very few places to eat once you start and a couple more that sell drinks and ice cream but when we visited we found these didn't open until 9 or even 10am. With more people on the ascent by then these were also quickly getting busy as we were on our way back to town. The complex itself is free to explore and there are no restrictions on photography beyond the usual courtesies if you want to include someone you don't know in your shot.

To sum up this is a free site very worth visiting for it's history and beauty, easily reached from Kyoto and one that definitely merits an early start. There are few opportunities for food and drink along the way so it would be a good idea to pack a little something along with some water and you are basically climbing a hill so if you have mobility problems it might not be very accessible much beyond the start.
I hope this is helpful to you on your visit and very much hope you enjoy it as much as we did.","Written April 23, 2020"

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Don’t let rain stop you!,"We went on a day that it was raining and took an umbrella each. It was well worth it!! It was not overcrowded so plenty of opportunities for photos without other tourists in the background. It takes about 2.5 - 3 hours to get to the top of mt. Inari and back with a quick stop for a drink and souvenir shops. The train station is practically across the road and most people are heading there so follow the crowd and you’ll find it. Stop number 6 on the trail has an awesome view and a pit stop cafe/drinks/icecream. This is where most people stop and go back down and I wouldn’t have regretted turning back at this point but we pushed on to the top, which included lots of stairs, and at the very top there was not a designated good view spot, but a large collection of shrines. There was a small building that I don’t know if it opens to the public or not as it wasn’t open.
The trail of tori gates and shrines really left you in awe and the forest was a refreshing contrast from the cityscape.
My legs were jelly once we started descending (from the top) and I’d consider myself to be of average/above average level of fitness, which is why I think stop 6 on the trail is a good spot to turn back if I did it again",
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Great shrine in south-east part of Kyoto,"We were there in the evening (about one hour before sunset, so the place definitely was not overcrowded.

Tori gates lead to thetop of the hill, where there are a few platforms allowing for great views on Kyoto, other surrounding hills and even Osaka. Additionally, everywhere are everywhere stone fox statues, as the shrine is devoted to deity of foxes, which are the messengers observing people. Very nice place, with some quiet, contemplative places, especially when not overcrowded. Absolutely ""must see"" in Kyoto.",

Along the main path, there are around 1000 gates, all coloured in bright Vermilion colours. Some of the gates have inscriptions, that people have carved in. The current structures date from the late 15th century. We were there late in the evening and dark and gives a different perspective and colours. You can hike up to the top of the mountain but it takes 2 hours to get there. Naturally, we could not do so. There are also many monkeys around and they can be quite nasty.

It is better to visit early in the morning. In one part of the shrine, there are small local stores, one of which sold boiled eggs- a must try! Delicious and boiled in the sacred waters of the shrine.

Officially the place is open till 5 pm. But in fact, it is safely accessible any time, so I recommend to come AFTER 5 pm.

Firstly, the place has a great lighting around all the temples 24/7 so you will see them well even when it’s dark - I added the pics here.

Secondly, it is not crowded at all in the evening, so you can enjoy your privacy on the nature side.

Thirdly, you will still be able to make it to all the suggested walks.

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Thousands of Torris,"The Fushimi Inari Taisha is the head shrine of Inari, the god of rice, sake and prosperity and patron of business, merchants and manufacturers. The shrine is at the base of Mount Inari and includes many smaller sub shrines.
At the shrine’s entrance we saw the Romon (tower) Gate, which is the main gate, and was built in 1589 thanks to donations from the samurai warlord and ruler of Japan, Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
We noticed stone statues around the main shrine that appeared to be unusual looking dogs. There were dozens of these in various poses. We learned that they were foxes. Foxes or kitsune in Japanese are regarded as the messengers of the gods. Some of the stone foxes even had keys in their mouths. Those were the keys to the rice granaries which they were protecting.

The main attraction at this stop are the thousands of torii shrine gates. There are more than 11,000 of them. Each of the famous torii shrine gates has been donated by an individual or a Japanese business in the hope of receiving good luck and fortune. The name of the donor is inscribed in black ink on the back of each gate. The cost of donating the torii starts around $400,000 JPY ($4,000 USD) for a small sized gate and increases to over 1,000,000 JPY ($10,000 USD) for a large gate.

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Great Experience.,"The shrine is a great experience and workout if you're keen to go to the top.
Located directly outside the Inari train station (JR line, 2 stops from Kyoto). We got there early around 7.30am there was maybe 2 other groups ahead of us. Best time to get some unrestricted photos of the Tori gates. Now be warned it is alot of stairs so be prepared for a workout. We were up and down in 1.5hrs and we weren't rushing, stopping alot for photos. Once at the bottom again there was a small food market setting up. We stayed here for breakfast and walked the market. Souvenirs are available from here too. Overall, loved it. Great morning activity. Go early, the hikes pretty and peaceful","Written February 13, 2020"
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Mysterious and Magical,"We arrived at Fushimi Inari around 6pm, so it's not yet that dark, but not really light as well... a twilight of sorts and it was magical (check the photo).

Japan has many beautiful temples, and we've visited quite a few, but this is probably one of the best we've seen.",

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,"Crown jewel of Kyoto attractions, the beauty just goes on and on","My absolute favorite attraction in Kyoto, and maybe all of Japan. When you enter Fushimi Inari, you are greeted with the tori gates with a big orange building with shinto foxes on both sides. This is the iconic picture of it, and one might be forgiven for thinking this is where it ends.

However the beauty of Fushimi Inari lies beyond the entrance, and moving past it to the other temples on the long set of stairs. Neither me or my wife are hikers, but we absolutely loved going up Fushmi Inari as we kept being greeted by ever more imposing thousands of tori gates. There are multiple temples along the way to the summit, which in itself are beautiful and worth stopping and paying homage. You will keep seeing the beautiful fox statues all across the hike too. Unfortunately our feet were too sore from all the walking in Kyoto, Osaka that we stopped a little bit short of the summit and never reached Mt. Inari.

At the base and even along the hike, there are food stalls selling local food items. We didn’t grab a bite, but if you’re adventurous it could be worth a try. With it’s free price label, I’d rank it Kyoto’s must-visit attraction and one of the “shouldn’t miss” places",
Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Missed it,"As we walked out from Fushimi Inari Station, we followed the crowds and took some pics of the big lovely temple in front of the station, with its majestic torri gate.
Then, we walked along a small street with many quaint Japanese houses and came across a food section where many varieties of food were sold.
After enjoying some food and resting, we walked on. We failed to find the entrance to the orange torri gates and Shrine. We tried asking some locals but were not successful with the directions given.
In the end, we gave up because we visited Arashiyama Bamboo Forest that morning and our legs were so tired.
We immediately regretted not persevering as we entered the JR train to return to Kyoto, but it was too late. Beats us how we could've failed to find it when so many others mention its proximity to the station.
Anyway, we told ourselves, this would be a good reason to come back to Kyoto again, to visit Fushimi Inari Shrine! But we must be fully prepared with really clear directions on how to reach it.","Written February 5, 2020"

From Arashimaya station, we took the JR train to Inari Station for our next itinerary, the Fushimi Inari Taisha. We started our walking tour from the shrine which sits at the base of the Mt Inari by walking through the thousands of vermillion torri gates which straddle a network of trails behind its main building. In fact the vermillion torri gate is the icon of Japan. On the way, there are many fox statues across the shrine grounds. We climbed up to Mt Inari which is 233m above sea level. It was just another 15 minute walk before reaching the peak, but we abandoned it as it was getting dark and there were not many visitors going up. So we decided to descend and walk back to Keihan Inari Station. It’s a good walk with fresh air and some beautiful scenery along the way.

Take some water with you as you can buy water and other soft drinks near the top cost a bit more money because you’re quite limited on what you can buy at that stage.

You could even buy a shrine mini replica which the sellers will put the date that you came with your name I believe as well but I can’t say about the name as I am going by when I bought it 10 years ago but they are still selling the same articles.

Once at the very top as you’re coming down feel free to take pictures as it is such a wonderful view as you can see on my photo.

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,A temple like no other,"It's said that this is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Japan, and I can believe it: we were there on a cold day in December and the place was absolutely swarming. I hardly dare contemplate what it must be like in the high season.

However, don't let that put you off. The temple complex covers the whole mountainside, and as you go up the mountain, the crowds fall away. The vast bulk of visitors only visit the lower part of the complex and of those who go further, most stop at the saddle where there is a great view of Kyoto, and a small restaurant. If you climb to the top (about a 15 minute walk from the saddle) and then take the loop path that leads you back to the saddle, you can enjoy an uncrowded walk along the forest path, dotted with those iconic orange Torii gates.

It's probably obvious, but it should be noted that this is NOT a destination for the mobility-impaired. The paths are steep and often narrow and there are a lot of irregular stone steps.","Written January 13, 2020"

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Incredible experience and view,"An absolute must whilst in Kyoto! We went in the early afternoon via train from Kyoto station. The train was quite crowded but as everyone lined up in an orderly fashion and 90% of the passengers were getting on at Kyoto station and off at Inari station, it wasn’t an issue with access. Going in the first week of the new year meant for large crowds so it often took a few minutes of waiting to get a non-crowded photo under the famous torii gates.

Got the JR line from Kyoto centre and the entrance was just over the road. At night this place no doubt has a very different feel, all lit up by lanterns. The crowds had almost vanished and just a handful of people were making the walk up and down the hill through the gates. We went to the very top (lots of steps, some effort required) and I felt it was well worth it. Heard monkeys in the forest, saw plenty of joru spiders on their webs, and met a bunch of friendly feral cats. One of my favourite places in Kyoto, available all around the clock, and best of all completely free. This is a must do!","Written January 9, 2020"

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Crowded Attraction,"After reading reviews, we arrived at the later half of the day, thinking there would be less crowd. Unfortunately, it was still very crowded. There were also large numbers of tour groups that added to the numbers.

The place itself is really nice and as majestic as the photos seen. What we discovered was, the higher you go, the thinner the crowds get. Most of the visitors are at the start of the gates. They stop to take photos and such. There are many sections and the further one goes, the lesser people and plenty of photo opportunities (without having strangers in your photo).",

Tip: we did this with a private tour guide who parked nearby and explained the history of the site and showed us around. Best way to do it instead of battling the crowds on the public transport","Written January 3, 2020"

Japan,Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine,Long but grounding,"We took what I’ll describe as the Robert Frost route (“two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and I - I took the one less travelled by...”): that is to say we took the forest hike that diverts from the main path and meanders around, and up the back of the mountain.

Along the way you’ll see stands of tall bamboo, and many smaller shines at regular intervals. There’s birds, insects, plants, and frogs along the path to keep you engaged. There’s also a woodworking workshop with a small waterfall.

The road trail turns sharply and narrows up the steepest part to the summit. If you’re lucky the lady at the shrine at this point will give the kids an ice lolly! BEST!

There’s no real view from the summit, but you start your descent down the path everyone else comes up (so you get to see everything they do). Enjoy the little shops on the way down (buy a unique tenugui cloth as a momento - and to mop the sweat from your brow!). And there is a gorgeous view of Kyoto 15 mins down the path.

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Where is good Shrine near Tokyo.,"Hello Guys. I lived in Tokyo about 40 years.

I just recommend around Tokyo Shrine.

Actually Maiji Jingu and Ysukuni jinnja are not Real Japanese God.

Meiji jingu enshrined is about 100 years ago Meiji Emperor.
And Yasukuni Jinja is killed in war.
But I recommended Meiji Jingu if you want get feel ""What is Shrine"" coz good atmosphere. Good sightseeing place.

You should go to ISE JINGU if you wanna see Real Japanese God.
This is real Japanese God of God in there.
Their history is about 2000 years

But Very far from Tokyo.
I recommend go to HIE JINJA at Akasaka Tokyo.
This shrine is very historical. About 800 years

Each Japanese shrine has meaning.
Example
Shrine A : Good for health.
Shrine B : Good for study.
Shrine C : Aviation God.
etc

You should find meaning before chosen go to Japanese Shrine .

Good luck.","Written July 16, 2021"

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Beautiful and spiritual place in otherwise busy Shibuya!,"The Meiji-Shrine is located adjacent to the Yoyogi Park and together they represent something that could be called Shibuyas green lung, to me. While Shibuya is more commonly known for its famous crossing and vivid nightlife, does it obviously have more to offer than its Urban landmarks. The Meiji Shrine area with its spritual and environmental perks is certainly one of them. Plenty of things to see and learn about here, which visitors can discover while taking an easy and picturesque stroll.",
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Meiji shrine,"Wandering in the serene dense woods of the Meiji shrine make me feel refresh and undisturbed. There is the biggest “Torii” of Japan standing outside the shrine. Meiji shrine is one of the important temples in Japan because of the history, which can date back to 100 years ago to worship the emperor of time.

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,A world so full of nature you'd swear you were in Tokyo,"東京を代表する神社の一つ。伊勢神宮のように鬱蒼とした森に囲まれ、晴れた日には燦燦と降り注ぐ木漏れ日が気持ちいい。これが人工の森だとは思わせない程に、自然環境のサイクルに委ねられ、人の手は最小限しか入っていない。神社の参拝をしなくても、散歩コースとしてピッタリなスポットだと思う。
山手線を挟んですぐ東側が原宿の商店街であるため、神社の境内の東側はやや人の喧騒が感じられる。しかし社殿に進むにつれてその喧騒は薄れ、本当に都内なのかと思うくらいに自然の音で満たされる。休日や年末年始は多くの人が訪れるため、明治神宮の静寂な雰囲気を味わうには平日の早朝がお勧めだ。
社殿をはじめ、鳥居などの様々な建物は、質素であり典型的な神社の建築構造であるが、それゆえに過度な主張をすることなく神社という聖域に見事に溶け込んでいるように見える。東京を代表するスポットではあるが、あまり固くなりすぎず肩の力を抜きゆったりと境内を歩いてみるといいかもしれない。

The Meiji Shrine is one of the most famous shrines in Tokyo. Like Ise Jingu, it is surrounded by a dense forest, and on a sunny day, you'll feel the brilliant sunlight filtering through the trees. You'll be surprised to learn that this is a man-made forest. There is minimal human care in the forest, and everything is left to the cycle of the natural environment. Even if you don't visit the shrine, it is a perfect spot for a walk.
As the east side of the shrine is the shopping district of Harajuku, you will feel a bit of the hustle and bustle of people as you walk along the east side of the shrine grounds. However, the hustle and bustle fades away as you proceed to the shrine building in the center of the grounds. You will feel so filled with the sounds of nature that you will wonder if you are really in Tokyo. Since many people visit the shrine on holidays and during the year-end and New Year holidays, early mornings on weekdays are recommended to enjoy the quiet atmosphere of Meiji Shrine.
The shrine main hall, torii gates, and various other buildings are simple and typical of the architectural structure of a shrine, but because of this, they seem to blend in perfectly with the sanctuary of the shrine without being overly assertive. Although it is one of the most popular spots in Tokyo, it would be a good idea to walk around the shrine grounds in a relaxed manner without being too rigid.","Written January 2, 2021"
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Breathtaking,"This was one of my favorite places to visit while in Tokyo. I could not believe that this shrine was right next to Harajuku since the streets were very crowded and noisy, but once you reached the shrine everything was quiet and ceremonial.
The surroundings are absolutely beautiful: there's a forest, an ikebana display where you can buy bonzai, and an amazing display of barrils made of straws that cointain sake. The locals were very sweet and taught us how to pray, how to purify ourselves with water and how to make a wish in a little piece of wood that would late be burnt by the monks. This is an absolute must for people visiting Tokyo.",

It's a short walk from the Harajuku station and you'll see the massive wooden torii gates.
Many events take place at Meiji Shrine throughout the year. If you happen to be there at the beginning of the year, there is a ceremony dedicated to sumo wrestling which takes place during the first week of January. You will see the sumo wrestlers receiving purification. You can probably see it on TV but if you are there at the time, you may see the Yokozuna up close.

The buildings and grounds are really special...as is the massive collection of sake barrels that you pass on your way in...some of them are works of art!

I was privileged enough to see a marriage ceremony going on too...it was lovely.

What is pretty amusing is the wine barrels donated by Japanese to the emperor and his wife.

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Beautiful and Serene - if you arrive early,"We arrived at the park surrounding the shrine at about 8 am. We were so pleased that it was quiet and peaceful. We took a stroll through the lovely man-made forest until we reached the shrine. It was quite a humbling place to be, and I appreciated that there were signs in English explaining how to show respect and perform rituals correctly (for example, the hand washing). We also paid the 1000 yen per person to visit the inner garden, which includes a stroll around a lake. We did not see flowers because of the season.
However, when we were leaving around 10:00, a steady stream of tourists was making their way through the park. I think our experience would have been very different if we arrived with them.

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Hands down - best experience in Tokyo,"I really loved this shrine - not joking when I say that it's the best experience I had in Tokyo. The shrine is in the city, but between its location on the hill and the long walk up the path to get there, by the time you get to the shrine it's almost as though you've been transported farther away from the rest of civilization than you really are.

This is definitely, definitely worth a visit. I'd highly advise going early to avoid the crowds and really get a chance to experience that walk and the shrine at its most serene.","Written October 20, 2019"
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Quite moved,"I find it to be the case at many shrines and temples in Asia that they are not really set up for tourists--they are often crowded with people, but there's very little translation of what you are seeing. This shrine is no exception. However, there is a seriousness and a reverence here that many shrines I have visited lack, and I think part of that is that to get here, you must walk through the most peaceful, wild gardens. You feel calm but invigorated by the time you arrive at the shrine. There were many tourists there--the World Cup was on--but they all seemed to behave a little better than you might expect. It was lovely. There's this couple of trees tied together by ropes representing eternity of marriage and of family. I stood under it and was quite moved as I looked up into the branches that have sort of woven themselves together over the years. I looked around, and I was surrounded by people, but I felt like I was experiencing a moment alone. It was awesome. There was a wedding that day--a really lovely thing to see.","Written October 19, 2019"
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Wow - what a beautiful & peaceful place,"This park & shrine is well worth a visit.

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Wonder Off from the Crowds,"After spending several days squeezing into subway trains, strolling along the neon lit alleys of Shinjuku and fighting through the hordes of Shibuya Crossing, visiting Meiji Temple was a welcome repast. At my daughter’s urging to see something cultural, we decided to visit Meiji Temple.

From the Tokyo Station, Google offered several recommended transit routes. I decided to take what appeared to be the most direct route to the temple. After exiting the subway station in a residential neighborhood, we followed a path by a horse stable and what looked like an isolated dead-end street. There was nothing that appeared to be a tourist site or a temple. We had visited Asakusa Temple the day before and fought through thousands of tourists to visit one of the most commercialized religious sites in the world. There was nothing that appeared to resemble a similarly popular tourist site. We followed an elderly woman through a path into a park located at the end of the block and discovered one of the most serene places I’ve been. Beyond a small guard shack there was what appeared to be an archway one would expect at a temple. Believing that we were on the right path we proceeded through a beautiful tree lined pathway with open fields and few other travelers. Although we had not yet come across a temple, out of curiosity we continued on. Finally, we came across some fellow visitors heading in the opposite direction who confirmed that we were on the right path to the temple. I felt that we were on a pilgrimage.

We finally came across the Temple and now scores of visitors. We realized that we had entered the Temple from the back though a less traveled route and now were amongst throngs of tourists. The Temple is a traditional large courtyard with a shrine where devotees could make offerings. This is a working religious center where there are several buildings dedicated to Shinto religious practitioners. There isn’t much to see at the temple itself but wander through the park surrounding the temple and the trip is well worth the journey. If you arrived at the Temple from the Harajuku/Shibuya entrance, do not get discouraged by the crowds, exit through the back of the Temple and explore the park away from the throngs of tourists, literally bus loads and bus loads of tourists. However, if you want to spend a day away from the concrete, multi story shopping complexes and crowds of people, the park is a lovely way to spend the day.

There is a very modern visitors center with a café, rest rooms, and a full service restaurant. We stopped at the café and had a snack. The food served at the café was surprising very good and very inexpensive. They offer a full range of Japanese food from soba to curry rice and pizza.

Get away from the crowds and explore the park grounds. Serene and beautiful.",

It actually worked out nice. Bring bug spray as this time of year its humid and the mosquitos are out, even in the middle of the day!
The temple itself is beautiful, especially the large wooden arches at each entrance. It was a nice change to see the natural wood and not the brightly painted orange arches that are so popular at every shrine in Japan.

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Beautiful Walk,"After seeing numerous shrines and temples in Kyoto, as lovely as the Meiji Shrine is, it is not as overwhelming as many other historical sites. That being said, the walk from the Torii to the actual shrine is quite tranquil and very enjoyable. Take a few moments to enjoy the 39 foot high main gate or Torii--it is made from 1,500 year old Hinoki Cypress trees. We also enjoyed the barrels of both sake and burgundy that had been donated to the shrine--great for a picture. From what I understand, the trees that are now part of the 170 acre complex were donated by people from all throughout Japan. Check out my photos for more details.",
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Mediocre...,"This shrine is right in the middle of the city but located in a forest-like garden full of tall trees. The area is so big that even when there are many tourists, it feels peaceful. There are lots of roads running within the forest, leading to and away from the shrine. The shrine itself is a peaceful place with tori gates.","Written August 18, 2019"
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Oasis in the middle of Tokyo,"We’d seen a lot of shrines by the time we visited. Pleasant as the Torri gates and buildings were, they’re not as impressive as Nikko for example, however the park and overall setting is a lovely recess from the hustle of the city. I’m not a Buddhist so can’t comment on the shrine from a religious perspective.",
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Fresh air in the city,"It was good 10-15 minutes walk from the subway. The shrine is surrounded by the forested park, it was really refreshing to explore around the park in the midst of the bustling city life.

A good place to explore if you are into nature & culture.","Written August 13, 2019"
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,170 acre forested shrine near Harajuku Metro Station.,"We took the Ginza Line from our 'b' Shimbashi Tokyo Hotel with 1 transfer to the Harajuku Metro Station. Crossing the bridge, we noted the 1964 Yoyogi National Gymnasium (1964 Olympics) then made our way to the 1st torigi arch marking the south entrance to this 1926 shrine. It opened to a wide pedestrian lane through the quiet 100 year old forest for 1 km, passing the odd Burgundy/Sake Barrel displays, then winding to the 2nd Grand Torigi Arch (40'H x 56' W utilizing 1500 year old cypress trees from Taiwan) to the 3rd torigi arch fronting the 2 story Main Gate to the Meiji Shrine Compound.
Arriving at 10 AM, we joined other tourists, locals, and 3 guided tour groups enjoying this serene natural atmosphere in the middle of Tokyo. We used the clean restrooms on the return to the metro.",
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,So beautiful,First of all the walk to the shrine is beautiful. It is like walking in a forest. It was very calming. There were little creeks along the path. It is just amazing that this is in the middle of Tokyo. The Shrine itself is very ornate and well taken care of. It is just beautiful. It took us a morning to walk around.

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Hot Day in Tokyo,"We were somewhat overwhelmed by the heat so were unable to enjoy this visit as fully as we would have liked. The group guide explained a lot of the various meaning and customs along the route including the purification process needed to enter the shrine itself. Most of our group did not go inside the shrine, but you were able to observe believers that entered the shrine for their blessing. Huge shade trees were present throughout the short walk leading back to the shrine.","Written August 5, 2019"
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Peace when everything else keeps moving.,"We found the city of Tokyo to be an even moving hustle of people and business, especially after the fun and madness of Shibuya crossing. Walking through the massive Tori Gate into Yoyogi park surrounding the shrine was a gentle slide into a green calm. Tourists thinned out as we got closer to the temple and we passed small side gardens, now closed, that we wish we'd be around earlier to explore them. A second enormous Tori gate announces your arrival to the Meiji Shrine and you are entered into the grounds of the shrine itself. We saw a lot of shrines over this trip and you get a little ""shrined out"" however the majesty of Meiji remained with us and cemented itself as our favorite. We performed the ritual washing of the hands (some wash their mouth out as well) as an act of respect before proceeding into the shrine proper. One inside, it opens itself to you and shows the grandeur of it's size. Stop on the edge and wait for a few minutes, take it all in, feel the timber that surrounds you and see the construction while the sweet smell of cedar wood and incense. A spiritual moment? Maybe... but for me, I really enjoy traditional timber construction and craftsmanship, along with the tactile sensations you get from them. What can I say, it's my bag! From there, move into the main courtyard and up to the actual shrine and burial place of Empower Meiji, the 122nd Emperor of Japan and the man who modernized the nation.
I feel the shrine really is a cultural must-see for Tokyo visitors. There are information boards all around describing the emperor and his rule. The shrine itself is a beautiful thing to behold and like us, you will want to buy one or the prayer boards (500 yen), write a prayer on it and place it on the hanger for the priests to present and offer the next day. You can also purchase any number of small charms for whatever luck you want. This is a fun think and it gives you some unique souvenirs. They may be a little pricey but if funds go to the upkeep and maintenance, I’m cool with that. Toilets abound through the park and pathways and there is a large cafe/restraint complex with souvenir shop. Good shop for traditional quality items over tacky fun ones.
Getting there is easy, either by walking up from Shibuya like we did or getting off at Harjuku, right on the park entrance. Come early or late as it appears the park gets busy in the main part of the day. If you are in Tokyo for some cultural satisfaction, this really is a must.",
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Breathing tradition,"A corner of great peace and serenity in a modern and fast metropolis.
The Meiji shrine It is mainly a beautiful Oasy of peace and tranquility especially during the days of the week when it is not crowded with tourists. A beautiful forest surrounds the sanctuary erected in honor of the emperor of the Meiji dynasty.

Definitely recommended a visit at least for a breath of fresh air and to take a break from the speed of Tokyo",
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Must do in Tokyo,"This place is stunning! We went on a weekday morning and it wasn’t too crowded. The walk to the shrine is shaded and peaceful. The washing of your hands before entering the shrine was amazing to watch. There are instructions in English, but we just observed the locals and followed suit. We were lucky to observe a ceremony going on inside, very moving. This is undoubtedly a highlight of our visit to Tokyo.",

Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,The serenity of Japan in the middle of Tokyo,"This is a wonderful Shrine and Gardens in central Tokyo near Shibuya Station. We came through the other entrance and worked out way through the Gardens and Shrine. Keep in mind no outside food or drink is allowed in and a guard is at the gates to be sure of that. But there is a place you can get a snack and drink once inside. There a number of water fonts throughout the gardens. They are there to express respect and not specifically religious beliefs as I understand it. Approach the font and rinse your left hand in the water, then your right hand, then cup the water in your hand and rinse your mouth, then rinse your left hand again. Use normal hygiene so as not to contaminate the water, the dipper or the water you rinse in your mouth. It may sound complicated but watch a few locals do it before you jump in and it's a great picture moment while you are there. Continue walking through the gardens and get to the temple in the center. There you can pay your respects by dropping a coin in the slot and praying or remembering loved ones. Again, watch the locals to see how to do it properly. Weave your way past the wine casks. You can read about why they are there. Around the same area there is a private garden you can pay a few dollars to walk through if you are so inclined. When you get to the other end of the gardens you are dropped off in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Shibuya where you can eat and do some high end shopping.","Written July 27, 2019"

The main shrine is stunning with is huge torii and beautiful colours I loved the row of burgundy wine barrels and sake barrels opposite, gifts for the consecration of the shrine.. There is a beautiful prayer wall too on the right as you look at the main shrine.
They ive you a nice little guide going in and you starmp it yourself with a lovely old ink stamper.
The pair of sacred Camphor trees in the forecourt are gorgeous. One was planted in memory of the Emperor who died in 1912, the other for the Empress who passed in 1920. They are two trees tended to look like one, a beautiful sentiment.
Now, one main bit of advice. Don't limit yourself just to the main shrine. Wander around the grounds as there are some simply gorgeous smaller ones dotted about. Anyway, a wonderful, spiritual place, very moving and captivating. An absolute must do.",
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Prepare for a good walk from subway station,From an entrance gate to the shrine took about 15 min. Be prepared to walk up slight inclines.

I had a better experience here than I had at the amazingly packed Senso-Ji, for instance. The Inner Gardens of the Temple are the absolute highlight here and are truly NOT TO BE MISSED. They do charge you 500 yen for admission in the gardens, but this was a lovely walk at one of the most beautiful gardens I have ever seen with different blossoms at each season of the year. We visited in June, and I heard that was the best time of the year to visit it, so I felt very glad and lucky.

At the moment part of the complex is under restoration, but it is worth the walk.","Written June 16, 2019"
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,a must-see on any visit to Tokyo,"my 18 y/o daughter and i spend a couple of hours here, and the grounds and shrine itself, along with the cafe area, were all lovely and peaceful. We even got to see a wedding procession while we were there. Please don't miss this lovely area.

I would recommend that tourists keep in mind that this should be a place for quiet conversations only, and to be respectful in your photo taking etc.","Written June 15, 2019"
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,"Nice Range of Sights, Not just Temples",We were there on a Sunday and saw four wedding processions. It was interesting- certainly busy with weddings. There are a range of buildings with the main temple being quite simple. There are nice walking paths in the gardens also and it is quite peaceful. It is a bit of a walk but you can also visit the hip young shopping area where you can see the weird and wonderful colourful Japanese youth.,
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Go early for less of a crowd,"We were here right around 10 AM and it wasn't too crowded. We started our morning very early at the nearby park and spent a lot of time strolling around and watching the adorable dogs play in the dog park. After killing some time, we headed to Meiji Jingu and as I said, it wasn't too crowded around 10 AM. I'm sure it gets more crowded the later it gets. It's set in a very pretty area with a lot of trees surrounding it. Even though you're right in the middle of a city, it has a magic about it that feels quite secluded and almost like you're in the mountains.","Written June 13, 2019"
Japan,Meiji Jingu Shrine,Favorite place in Tokyo,"Walking through the Torii gate at the entrance to the park removes you from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. There is quite a long walk to the shrine itself but it is through a forest of greenery. It makes your visit much more enjoyable than Senso-ji which is too crowded to enjoy (in my opinion). There is a lovely smaller garden called the Inner Garden that is also quite beautiful. An admission is charged for that part of the garden but not the main shrine area.

We ate a light lunch at the cafe by the entrance. It was a great place with delicious food and fun people watching.

Would definitely recommend this oasis in the middle of Tokyo.","Written June 11, 2019"

Japan,Yokohama Minato Mirai 21,"Many things here were once the first in the world... Tower, wheel, escalator.","Yokohama unlike Tokyo has a pronounced city center - Minato Mirai 21. ""Minato Mirai"" means ""harbor of the future"". So if you are already here, consider the future has already come. The futuristic area was created on the site of the former shipyard of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the railway station. The mayor of Yokohama, Ichio Asukata put forward this idea back in 1965. The path is not close to the idea to implementation. Construction began only in 1983 and is still in progress. The main landmark of the area and Yokohama's whole is called... Landmark Tower. I'm catching on. Tautology. Once the first tall building in Japan was built in 1993. The Landmark Tower has been ranked number 2 since 2012. Tokyo towers don't count. These are structures, not buildings.The Landmark Tower has an observatory on its 69th floor called the Sky Garden. The climb to the once fastest Elevator in the world will take 45 seconds. That's what the guidebooks say. It took us 38 seconds. Upstairs there is a bar, a gift shop and the best views of Yokohama. Shopping center Landmark Plaza waits for you downstairs.Queen's Towers, the neighbours of Landmark Tower, have many floors also. Several showrooms of car companies are scattered around the area. Chief of them is Nissan. As you know, its headquarters are here in Yokohama. Other entertainment is nearby. This is Cosmo world Park with a giant Ferris wheel, which used to be the largest in the world. There is no entrance fee to the Park, some attractions cost 300-800 yen each. The most romantic attraction of Minato Mirai is right there. This is training ship Nippon Maru (translated as ""Japanese ship"") set out in dry dock in 1984 and converted into a Museum. Yokohama port Museum is nearby. Admission: 400 yen for either museum, 600 yen for both. If the Museum itch has not passed, you can visit an unusual Museum, which you will not find, for example, in Europe. Cup Noodles Museum is located here on the island 100 meters from the Ferris Wheel. Here you can prepare your own ramen, make your own design packaging for noodles, etc. Each time paying an extra fee in addition to the entrance ticket of 500 yen.",

There are a few museums in the area, nice to walk along the waterfront that is very neat and tidy , it has been well done. The huge wheel is there to see with the time on it at the top , very handy. When you get to the harbour the views are great and there is a nice floating restaurant there called Pier 21.
From there look back to the city and view some very impressive buildings.
This is a modern area but also with old history, take note of two big water pumps that were brought from London England in the 1890s to pump water when the docks were being built , read the history there.

Japan,Yokohama Minato Mirai 21,Lots to see and do here!,"Built on the old Mitsubishi shipyard (a couple of the yard's drydocks are preserved) and a railyard, this is now the central business district of Yokohama with a huge office building (the Landmark Tower), convention center (Pacifico Yokohama), museums, shopping centers, amusement park, hotels, restaurants, etc. It is a well laid (planned actually) complex that balances all of these disparate parts beautifully (from functional and aesthetic viewpoints). We have been here many times over the past 20 years and always have enjoyed the energy of the place, not the mention the views, etc.

The Intercontinental is certainly the hotel of choice with its spectacular views of the harbor beyond, but the Pan Pacific is also very nice and is more closely connected to the shopping areas and the big office tower - we've stayed at both several times. If you can't find a restaurant (or two or three) to your liking, then you must be doing something wrong. When not eating and sleeping, there is always something to do - although we often enjoy simply walking around and looking at the activity in the harbor or watching the people enjoying themselves.","Written November 19, 2017"

Japan,Yokohama Minato Mirai 21,Relaxing place in the midst of business district!,"It was a relaxing place walking along the waterfront! Coming from Tokyo, you will find yourself some breather in this place in Yokohama. You could find a place of solace, reading a book or just sit down with a beer enjoying the sea breeze with your loved ones! While I was there, I could see many young families, especially, bring along their children in strollers and dogs there. This place looks like an area for family outings. I went there in the daytime, perhaps you could find couples more in the night time. I believe the night scenery would be even more fantastic and provides a romantic place for couples there. If you have relaxed enough, pop into one of the shopping centres along the waterfront and start your adventure hunt again. Minato Mirai 21 is a place which provides people who likes to shop and at the same time chill along the waterfront. Truly enjoyed this place. Could have easily spent the whole day there!",

The fun rides, such as a rollercoaster appearing to dash into water, makes for great fun.

Japan,Yokohama Minato Mirai 21,A must visit in Yokohama!,"Yokohama is a great example of two sides of a city, conveniently demarcated by the train that passes through. On one side, you have a sprawling concrete jungle filled, and on the other, a pleasant bay side area. Minato-mirai is located on the bay side and does not typically represent one building or one park but is identified by a conglomerate of these. You can have your fill of shopping delights, while with just a walk away is an amusement park for that extra fun. But what really strikes you is how each attraction in the area compliments the other! If you need to take a load off, just head to the pier (Osanbashi or Yamashita) and just sit back and relax.

Japan,Yokohama Minato Mirai 21,Classic boat tours and shopping,"Boat tours take you around this part of the Yokohama harbour which is less attractive than Hong Kong for instance. I found the Yokohama Museum of Art great for its sculptures. For ship lovers the Nippon Maru tall ship built in 1930 and decommissioned in 1984 is worth a tour. The Nippon Maru Memorial Park is actually not a park as one would expect lawns and trees, it's more concrete than nature, joggers use it.
Shoppers can go to the Landmark Tower or the opposite Queen's Square or even to the more affordable World Porters on Shinko island, a 15-minute walk.

The promenade is beautifully landscaped and scattered with statues and momentos of its maritime heritage. It is also excellent for day activities for kids as it has attractions and ferris wheel similar like in Osaka. If weather does not cooperate, you could spend several hours (and thousand dollars) shopping and eating and cinema at Collet Mare Shopping Malls. If you still have energy and credit limit in your card, head to the Aeon mall about 1 km from the station. For the Captain Haddock's fans, you must visit inside the Nipppon Maru. Allocate at least a full day for this - enjoy lunch outside.",

Japan,Yokohama Minato Mirai 21,Flawless area in Yokohama,"Minatomirai is without a doubt one of the nicest places in Yokohama. The business district is quiet, clean and modern. There's really nothing to complain about. Besides, it offers many possibilities for shopping and dining.

Some notable buildings in Minatomirai are: the Landmark Tower, Queenstower A/B/C, MarkIs, World Porters, the Red Brick Warehouse, the Cup Noodles Museum and of course the iconic Cosmo Clock 21 which used to be the biggest Ferris wheel in the world. At night, every quarter of an hour an animated light show lights up the Ferris wheel for 5 minutes. The 10 remaining minutes are lit up green with a white pointer, imitating a huge green clock. There's also a beautiful harbor which is visited by many couples at night. I recommend going there at night to see the beauty of Minatomirai. Furthermore, a smaller but authentic entertainment district, Noge, is right around the corner near the JR Sakuragicho station. There are countless small bars (izakayas) and restaurants. It's the perfect place for grabbing a few drinks after work with your colleagues. Also worth visiting is the Chinatown near Motomachi station which is around 5 minutes by subway from Minatomirai station.

It's been a pleasure working here; even after 3 months of work I couldn't stop taking pictures of Minatomirai on my way home.",

The closest train stations are on the aptly named Minato Mirai line although you can also walk to closer parts from Yokohama or Sakaragicho stations. Note it is long walk in the station from central Yokohama Station to the Minato Mirai line however, so if you have JR pass already, it is probably just as well to stick with the JR stations.

In this area you can get to such landmarks as the Yokohama Landmark Tower (the tallest building in Japan when it opened) and the large Ferris Wheel in front of the Cosmo Amusement Park. You can also see the Yokohama Bay Bridge from this area. There is lots of shopping including the Red Brick Warehouses. We came here to visit the Cup Noodles Museum.

The tall ship Nippon Maru is anchored here but every single day we were available to take the tour, the box office was closed. Even on sunny days. So it was a disappointment not to be able to tour this majestic tall ship, especially when one has to walk right by it every time one is out!

The moving walkways between the New Otani Inn and the Landmark Hotel (where a good deal of the shopping and restaurants are located) are a real step-saver.

Shops I liked in the area include the Hard Rock Cafe, Starbucks, the grocery store and convenience store. If I were a little more adventurous in the dining category, I would have had a good time exploring the many Asian restaurants on the basement floor. We did enjoy Kissho on the 5th floor of the Landmark for shabu shabu, although it was a bit pricey for the value.

Overall, if you're a shopper, this is the place for you. If you're not, then it's just another pretty Asian mall area.","Written July 12, 2016"

If you are in Tokyo, I would highly recommend you visit Yokohama - either a day trip or spend a couple of days here. It is just 35-45mins by train from Tokyo (Shimbashi to Yokohama).

The view (both day time and night time) of the Yokohama port is simply stunning! Spent a couple of hours just walking along side the port and taking in the beautiful view. Interesting places to visit around this area are - Landmark Tower Sky Garden (great view of Yokohama from the top), Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse, Osanbashi Pier (stunning view!), shopping malls, Hard Rock Cafe Yokohama, Cup Noodles museum and many more! One can easily spend a day here, which is what we did.

With that being said, to get to various locations, you'll need to walk and get used to walking long distances as there is no public transportation that will take you there or to Osanbashi. So, have good shoes/socks before going to this location. And if you haven't walked long distances in awhile, get in the habit of doing so, if you plan to visit this location.

But definitely check out the Cosmo Clock 21 Ferris Wheel, the Landmark tower, Osanbashi, Yokohama Bay Bridge and more!",

It's a nice place to just walk or to jog, if the wind is not too strong.
It's even better if you rent a Bay Bike, it takes you to other interesting Yokohama area faster and cheaper, such as China Town or Yamashita Park. But registration is needed beforehand, that's a little time consuming. It's 150 yen per 30 minutes, you can drop them off at any Bay Bike spots. All the bicycles are with motors, it is really convenient.

The view from the sky scrapers makes you feel like you're in Singapore, not in Japan.

Japan,Yokohama Minato Mirai 21,Yokohama’s ‘centre of gravity’.,"Minato Mirai (Harbor of the Future) offers many shopping and dining options. Access by train is easy since Minato Mirai Station is right in Queen's Square (basement level). We took a day trip from Shibuya with a valued Yokohama-MM Pass.
Much of the Minato Mirai 21 area where the Landmark Tower stands are reclaimed land. We skipped the Sky Garden of the Landmark Tower (highest observation deck in Japan, miss the thrilling 360° panoramic view..) but zoomed into ground level instead. There are many Cafes and souvenir shops and we are happy with just window-shopping. The many shopping and entertainment facilities gathered here include the Yokohama Museum of Art, the Mitsubishi Minatomirai Industrial Museum where you can learn about the universe and energy, and Warner Cinemas Minato Mirai multiplex movie theaters. The Cosmo World amusement park has the world's largest Ferris wheel but also functions as a clock. There is also the famous Cup Noodles Museum, shopping at World Porter (our favourite!!), Landmark Plaza, Queen's Square. A little beyond, by foot, will be the Red Brick Warehouse and where one can stroll along the waterfront and the promenade at Yamashit Park.

We loved this place which can be best seen and experience by just walking about.! Cannot help making reference to Kobe HabourLand.
It is also fun and awesome place to spend one’s evening here; evening is the best time to see MM21 and its wonderful lights (esp the beautifully lighted up giant ferries wheel). It sure feels very romantic strolling along the promenade, simply spectacular!
There are many simply too many things to do in Minato Minai and one cannot but just lament that we did not have enough time to take it all in. !! Come appreciate for yourself.",

A contrast to Odaiba, which does the wide open spaces thing well, but connected only by the Yurikamome. I wasn't able to stick around for sunset (weather was changing quickly), but will have to take a night time stroll on a future visit.

Also, the now-annual Pikachu Dance Invasion was in full swing when I was there, and you could not escape seeing the little yellow Pokémon everywhere throughout the district.",

The museum housed inside few historic buildings gave visitors rich and impressive information how the Toyota giant began as a weaving machines maker to become motor giants. More so there is no anything bullish show off during the journey.

A lot of classy Japanese vintage cars couldn't find anywhere. Almost a must see in a Nagoya leisure trip.",
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,"More than just the ""Cars"" that are the ""Stars""!","Arriving in Nagoya mid-morning by train from Matsumoto, I thought I would abandon my luggage in a locker at Nagoya Station and head to the Toyota Museum before checking-in to my hotel for a 2-night stay. A short hop (1-stop) on a local Meitetsu train to the nearby Sako Station and a few minutes walk down the street brings you to the main entrance. Just entering the attraction, it immediately earned 5-stars for me when I discovered that the normal Y500 entrance fee is waived for Seniors (over 65's) like myself. Audio guides are available if required for Y200, but for me the informative leaflet in English was sufficient to find my way around.
I was blissfully unaware of the Textile Machinery Pavilion and Toyota's history of spinning and weaving prior to visiting and found this part of the exhibit surprisingly interesting. Like most people, I had been drawn to the Museum by the ""Cars"" and the Automotive Pavilion contained a reasonable cross-section of models across the decades since Toyota's first passenger car (Model AA) was produced in 1936.
As well as the cars, I particularly enjoyed the Production Line Reconstructions associated with the Model AA and the exhibit where robotic arms assemble a modern car chassis (.... press the button, stand back and video the balletic performance!).
Before you leave, make sure you take in a performance of a Toyota robot playing the violin in the South Lobby (see leaflet for times). It's not only the ""Cars"" that are the ""Stars""!",

The textile section tells the story of the textile industry going back to pre-historic times. On display are every textile machine through history until now, with demonstrations. I knew some about this topic, but this section blew me away. The car section does the same for the Toyota car company.

We went to Nagoya just to go to this museum and to the SCMaglev museum, but really underestimated the time it would take to see both, and never made it to the SCMaglev. For someone on the geeky side, like me, this museum is a whole day event. They also have a nice cafeteria, where we had lunch.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Surprised by how good it is,"One of my travelling companions wanted to visit this museum as her first car was a Toyota. As the Toyota museum is part of the sight seeing bus we made it our last stop before heading to the hotel.

We arrived before 3pm but was surprised by how much there was to see and learn. There is the Weaving/Loom Pavilion which tells you about the original founder of Toyota Loom, Sakichi Toyoda. There were really good videos (in English) detailing Sakichi-san's passion and the original of the looming machines that are still in use today. This section was large. It took us more than 1 hour to finish this hall.

We then moved onto Toyota Automobile which tells of Sakichi-san's son, Kiichiro Toyoda's passion and how he started researching and building cars in Japan. We ran out of time, but I estimate we could have stayed for another hour in this area.

Next is the future of inventions. There is a TechnoLand for children. We didn't have time to go in. But through the hall we saw that it was very interesting for primary and junior high school students.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Brilliant experience for all the family,"Aside from the Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium, we had most fun visiting the Toyota Museum. The cost of entry was very reasonable, 500 Yen for adults and 200 Yen for children. And our children who are aged 7 and 8 had a fantastic time here.

The entire place is fully air-conditioned, fully of history, and includes various halls and rooms displaying the different aspects of the history of the Toyoda family and Toyota. There is even an area just for kids.

The first hall we visited was an absolutely huge one full of machinery including those used for spinning and weaving and grading cotton. The machinery is pretty amazing and many of them were running for display and included jacquard weaving machines.

The next massive area was full of car machinery, robotic assembly lines and heavy machinery used to manufacture different car parts including those to weld together the different main parts such as body panels, roof etc. In addition, there was a wonderful display of old Toyota and some modern Lexus cars.

In one area of this hall was an area for kids where they could make a toy car from parts.

Finally, there is a nice gift shop, cafe with decent food, and a robot that plays the violin.

For anyone that has an interest in history or cars or machinery and manufacturing, I would absolutely recommend visiting this museum. It really is interesting and pretty unique.",
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Lots to do and learn,"Paid a minimal entrance fees and the children could learn basic science and road safety in the technology section. This section is educational and children could have hands on experience on activities that educate on wind resistance, among many other concepts.
For adults, it’s interesting to learn that Toyota started off as a garment weaving factory before moving on to manufacture automobiles in the industrial era.
The museum preserves machinery from yester years and there are staff at certain stations to give informative in Japanese. There are English tours available at certain time of the day. The showcase of different Toyotas from different era is highly educational and brings back memories.

Overall this museum is a highlight is Nagoya and highly recommend to visit if in Nagoya.",

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Best Museum we visited in Japan,"We were pleasantly surprised by this museum. We had assumed it would be mainly a car museum with lots of Toyota models. If that's what you are after, you might be disappointed. In fact it was so much better than we had assumed. We had no idea that the Toyota company started with cotton spinning/weaving. Half of this museum is dedicated to the development of technology for that part of the industry, and the other half of the museum is dedicated to the technology development for their automotive industry. Everything is interactive, with so many of the machines operating at the press of a button, or demonstrated by very knowledgeable staff (in English for us). We were given sample wash-cloths from one of the weaving machines and a sample engine part from the forging demonstration. In the automotive section we watched full-sized automotive manufacturing robots demonstrating how they put a vehicle together, weld and paint it, and a full-size model of the inner workings of a car demonstrated how a car works, complete with English commentary and lights indicated each component as it was spoken about. The whole museum was just incredibly well set up and very informative.
As a bonus all our kids got to construct a miniature pull-back model of the Model A Toyota for no extra cost, as well as a stamped key ring and molded plastic key ring, which were designed to demonstrate industrial processes.
There is a kids play area that you book into a time slot for (no additional cost) and a cafe.","Written January 11, 2019"

You can actually see the looms run, cotton convert into thread, history of toyota, see how forgings are made, see how robots work to weld a car, paint a car... an overview of the assembly process in olden days. Though our trip was for only 1.5 hrs, i felt minimum 4 hrs r required for covering the entire museum. If u want a guide u can be one of the 1st 20 customers. It opens at 9:30am. But even without a guide you can understand most of it. English or japanese you'll not hv a problem. The demonstrators r very courteous which is typical of the Japanese culture. There's also a museum shop where you can buy some artefacts related to Toyota like scaled versions of actual cars. One'll also get to know the entire history of Toyota. Fascinating and rivetting.

It is interesting to see the evolution of textile and automobile production from manual equipments to high-tech automatic robotic technology. Scientific principles and historical facts are very clearly explained and there are ample English signs around the museum. There are many interactive exhibits, such as the 600-ton metal press which can be controlled by visitors. (Very fun and fascinating.) Don't miss the robot violinist, who plays 2 musical pieces every 2 hours. In my opinion, the robot violinist is impressive and plays like a real violinist, but the violin sounds squeaky due to insufficient rosin on the bow.","Written May 20, 2018"

You then go into the history of cars in japan before going onto the cars. There are old cars to new cars and you can learn about the development as well as machines doing displays of how to construct cars. Again there are loads of staff around to ask questions.

In textile part, almost there will be a guide beside every machine to explain the production flow while the machine is running (not sure whether there's any English session as we joined the Japanese speaking in random).

As for the automotive area, it is more enjoyable (in my opinion) as there are many automated demonstrations including the assembling sessions. It is more relax as we can see the demo repeatedly by pressing a button.
There are also some guides to explain the vehicles' specialties.

The souvenir shop is also worth to stop by to buy some limited edition goods.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Comprehensive overview of Toyoda family and their business dynasty,"This museum provides a comprehensive overview of the Toyoda family and the Toyota conglomerate. We found the textiles section a bit boring, but the automotive section was fascinating.

The first half of the museum was about the textiles background of the Toyota company was well as the history of the founder of the company. There was a big showroom on looms, but we weren't too interested in that.

The second half of the museum was dedicated to the Toyota automotive company and that was much more up our alley. We saw a robot play a couple of songs on the violin, which was astounding in its level of detail and perfection (we saw the 2:40pm performance - check the guide as there are only a couple a day). We saw footage other other robots performing, although those robots were retired and just on display. We went on the 3:15pm free English speaking tour and we were lucky enough to have a private tour as we were the only attendees. Our guide took us on a 45 minute tour of the automotive section. We liked that there were staff posted at each main exhibit and our guide would ask them to demonstrate their exhibit for us. Some staff opened the doors of vintage cars to show us their interiors. Others did live demos of on shaping machines. We wouldn't have known to ask them for a demonstration if the guide hadn't been with us. We were shown how automated car production is these days with the use of robots. The robots that put together the cars were awesome. There was also a large exhibition hall containing different types of Toyota cars from vintage cars to the latest models. We were particularly impressed with the electric and hydrogen powered vehicles and are keen to own one ourselves one day.

There was also techno land, an interactive section of the museum mainly for kids (and big kids) where you could go on rides like a car ride where the object of the ride is to leave a safe space between you and the cartoon vehicle in front and a wind tunnel where you can experience what it's like to be in winds of 15 miles a second. We spent 30min in that section.",
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Very informative!,"If you are interested in cars and engines, this attraction is for you! The exhibits on Toyota's history as well as the development of its automotive parts are excellent. There is also a demo on the car assembly operated by robots.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Toyota as textile Company,,"Written March 22, 2018"
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Best place to visit in Nagoya,"To be honest, Nagoya is more of a transportation hub than a tourist spot. The Nagoya castle is only so so, and the famous Nagoya wings are not that special either.

Toyota Commemorative Museum in Nagoya is surprisingly a great place to visit and definitely the top attraction in Nagoya. To set the expectation right, this is not like Geneva car show or one of those full blown automotive museum in Europe. But it does have its unique charm and definitely worth a visit if you are in Nagoya area.

Location:
======
It's about 10 to 15 minutes by bus or taxi to the museum from Nagoya station. I'd recommend a taxi for a party of 4 since the fare would be about the same as that of taking a bus.

Admission:
=======
Ticket admission is relatively cheap and seniors can enter for free. Note that senior discount in Japan is usually limited to local residents of that particular region, not to mention foreigners. So, it is unusual for foreign seniors to have this type of discount.

Museum:
=======
Museum is separated into two section, the textile and the automotive section. (Toyota started off as a textile company). Even if you are not into textile , the display of many full scale textile machines are very impressive. Even if you want to skip this section, try to stop by one or two of the demo stations to watch the huge machines in action.

The automotive section mostly focused on how Toyota started and how it turned in to the automotive giant. Most exhibits are in Japanese with some English. I'd highly recommend the free English guided tour. (See below).

Even if you don't like cars, you can easily spend 1 - 2 hours in the automotive section. There are demos of many full size manufacturing machines to explain different phase in the automobile production. There are some very modern manufacturing robots too. Since the focus is more on the toyota automotive technology as well as its manufacturing, don't expect a full display of all Toyota models even though the display floor is huge. Unlike car shows, for most of the cars displayed, visitors are not allowed to sit inside.

Children friendliness:
================
Throughout the museum, there are numerous children friendly display for kids to interact with. However, live demos are explained only in Japanese. But overall, kids can still have a good time fiddling with the different exhibits.
Don't miss out do it yourself model car assembling station for kids. They give you a kit for model cars for the children to assemble. It's a lot of fun.

There is also a violin recital played by a Toyota robot. Unfortunately, that performance was a bit disappointing , maybe I was expecting too much. It was nevertheless an engineering marvel.

English guided tour:
===============
You'll need to check the time of the English guided tour as well as sign up for it when you enter the museum. They will give you a receipt for the guided tour. Some reviewers complained that the tour guide's English was hard to understand, but that's not my case. The guide we had was excellent and we had no problem understanding her English. I highly recommend joining the guided tour , it helped me understand many of the main exhibits in a quick concise way. Tour lasted about 30-45 minutes.

Recommendations:
==============
- Remember that seniors get free admission
- Take a taxi from Nagoya Station if you are a party of 4
- Sign up for English guided tour at the entrance (where they collect your ticket)
- Model Car kit for children.
- There is a cafe but I'd have a meal before coming here.
- I would allocate at least 2-3 hours for the museum, (or more if you are a car enthusiast)","Written March 12, 2018"

Easy to get to by a quick bus ride, you can spend the better part of a day here. There are two main sections (textiles and cars) and both are equally as interesting. (We spent too much time on the textile side and almost forgot about the car side!) The live demonstrations of the machinery on both sections of the museum bring to life processes of history.

As an engineer, I completely appreciated how things were presented with plenty of information for someone with a technical background. However even for children and people unfamiliar with the technology, there are many fun things to see and enjoy.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Impressive interactive exhibits,"I decided to go here based on a review that raved about a part of the museum that we didn't even get to visit! Still enjoyed it! The first section of the museum is about textiles that were made by the Toyoda company before they got into the car business. The sheer quantity of machinery they have here is astounding. I'd recommend trying to spend under an hour in the first part so you don't get so burned out that you don't appreciate the rest. Honestly, you could spend a full 8 hour day in this museum. The second part of the museum is automobiles, of course. There are a ton of interactive exhibits that explain how a car works. Throughout the museum (both textile + cars) there are staff members giving demonstrations and explanations in both Japanese and English -- maybe not everyday, but we went on a weekend. The final segment of the museum is an area probably designed for kids but anyone can enter. However, this is a ticketed attraction that has reservations for entrance times. We didn't realize that until very late in the day, and couldn't get into that section for another 2 hours because it was all full. Ask about how to reserve a time for it when you get your tickets.

They have a number of manufacturing machines that you can see operate (at least in part) that I found really interesting. They also have examples of their cars, both past and present, as well as a glimpse into their future potential offerings. Really little kids might not love the textile aspect of the museum to be honest but the car part might just spark their imagination.","Written December 4, 2017"
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Unexpected fun,I went thinking would just be a mock factory you walk through. I was very wrong. They had a huge area on textiles with ancient looms and advancing up to current methods of making cloth. The car area walked you through the history of every part of the car. They did have mock sections of a factory and explained the process and then they moved into future cars. Was there only a couple hours but could easily stayed longer. There were also interactive things for kids to do,"Written December 4, 2017"

The staff are superb, plenty of English spoken and the exhibits are really interesting. A couple of hours will tell you a lot about how Toyota started and the company history which tends to gloss over the unpleasantness during the early 1940’s but nevertheless very informative.

Not only it shows the history of textile and automotive machinery but it also explains in details, shows how things work, and displays interactively the technology evolution in a very nice and interesting way. It is both very educational and fun. The building itself was renovated from the original factory and already worth the visit. Location is close to Nagoya station with free parking.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,An Interactive Automotive Museum With Many Surprises,"I consider the Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology in Nagoya a must-see for not just gear-heads (like myself and my brother who visited with me) but also for families with children who will be interested by the myriad interactive displays. But the tour starts where inventor and industrialist Toyoda started; with textile loom technology and development. In the entry lobby to the textile museum stands the massive circular loom invented by Toyoda at the beginning of the 20th century. This intriguing 1906 machine is still operable and is demonstrated by a docent on a regular schedule.

Many of the machines and processes of both textile and automotive technology are actuated by your press of a button or operated and explained in both Japanese and English by one of the many museum docents. In the auto section the kid in me enjoyed simultaneously pressing two large buttons (just as a press operator must do) to actuate the 600-ton sheet-metal press on display.

The signage is in Japanese and English and the docents, who are assigned to particular displays, have enough English to explain their display. There is a cafe in the museum where we had an inexpensive light lunch. The museum's admission charge is a very reasonable 500 Yen for adults (currently about $4.50US). Children are at a reduced rate but my brother and I as Seniors (65+) received free admission.","Written October 10, 2017"

It is really the story of the 20th century, told through the lens of a Japanese entrepreneur, and also gives a glimpse he future of cars. It was well worth the visit for those interested in cars, science, engineering and technology, and also for those who are really not so interested in those topics, who also will learn something. The site is well laid out and easy to follow. They have a restaurant (did not try) outside the admission area, and a nice cafe which I did eat at.

The museum is huge and laid out beautifully, the exhibits are very interesting with some of them working and some of them interactive as well, which is exactly what I like in a museum.

There is English-speaking audio tour equipment available for Y200 (about $2). Toyota started as a textile manufacturer. There are textile and automotive sections. Throughout both sections were clear, live demonstrations of spinning cotton, from spinning wheels to modern equipment. I was amazed at how many working pieces of equipment were there. Numerous times, the staff would start a demo when I approached their area. The auto section has many displays with moving parts showing how auto systems work (e.g. steering, brakes, transmission, etc.), and the manufacturing process. I don't have young kids, but there was an interactive section for kids that looked very engaging.

I would highly recommend this museum.",
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,A gem.,"My 12 year old son and I went on vacation in Japan. We could not secure a factory tour, so we opted to do this instead since we were in Nagoya.

We went to see the car museum in mind, but were fascinated by the Toyota looms and spinning machines that were the foundation of the company. It was a lovely learning experience to see how machines take raw cotton and turn it into yarn, thread, and then fabric. Many of the machines are operational and show you the entire process.

The car museum is cool too. In expected Japanese fashion, the museum get into the small details of the inside of a car and how it is made.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Must Visit !,"We stayed in the Marriott hotel in Nagoya Station and it's just one railway station from the hotel.

There're a lot of exhibitions and demonstration. We didn't join the guided English tours, but it's not difficult to understand. It's actually like a science museum, but focusing on weaving and car related (Toyota was started up as a weaving factory).
Besides exhibition, there is a game center which games are also related to car science. For sure kids will have fun there, don't miss it if you've kids. Even I and my wife enjoyed the games there.

We saw enough to understand car making Toyota style, All in all, a good visit and very organized and clean factory. The museum displays the history of Toyota with the important cars on display.

Looms are weaving machines. We were so happy to see this because we had no idea we would find such huge display of looms, the history and the time line of the Toyoda Looms Works who later became Toyota Motor Corporation. You can observe the many different types of looms from the antique and very simple models to the very huge more modern types. The entrance fee is very affordable and it is a very popular place to visit. I recommend going early. After seeing the looms area which by the way is very big, we moved on to the car display warehouse or show room. Again we were amazed to learn the history of how Toyoda became Toyota and the whole line of cars that were produced in the early years. This is an amazing place to visit and it will not let you down.

It allows an interesting view of Toyota and the tour can be as quick or long as you want; three hours will cover most of the facility and they have a few activities for small kids. The context can be a bit technical but they managed to offer exhibitions that are also fun to watch, with robots and parts of the production line that go in motion at the touch of a button. Easy to access; although subway stations aren't as close and a 15 min walk is necessary. The museum is open until later most days; and taxis are available. A small souvenir store offers toys; small models of the Toyota cars and some clothing; sizes are limited to small - medium. Perhaps not as exciting to small kids, but teenagers would find it interesting.",

Most of it is self explanatory but we also had a guide with good English to help us although it was hard to hear clearly. It was fascinating to see cars being assembled with a mixture of people and robots. In the museum we saw some of the latest models and future innovations as well as some parts of the company's past history. A very glossy high tech display that was well worth the visit.,"Written May 14, 2017"
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Superb museum,Great displays about the history and the manufacturing process of Toyota...a little too much is dedicated to the looms but the automotive section would impress even those not interested in cars...good few hours spent here!,
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Great Experience,definitely worth an afternoon in Nagoya. A lot of Toyota history to view. From the early days to present,"Written May 13, 2017"
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,"NIcely spent few hours, but dedicated mostly to looms, not cars","NIcely spent few hours. But if you are a car enthusiast and expect tons and tons of Toyota cars, please be aware that cars and car industry is roughly just a one third of the whole museum. The rest is dedicated to circular looms and this kind of machines, which made Toyota successfull and recognised worldwide.

Despite the ""Direction & Public Transportation"" information at the official pages, I do recommend you to go to ""Sako"" station instead. If you come from Nagoya station direction, the exit and museum direction will be towards your direction. Just go downstairs in the train station and walk towards east. Cross the street to your right side and continue walking east. You will arrive in 5-10 minutes, tops.

In April, the entrance fee was 500JPY for an adult, students have 200/300JPY discount. You can also buy annual ticket and several others, but most of you will stick with the 500JPY basic. The tickets can be purchased at the vending machine, which is also in English (I remember seeing there also Korean language, one kind of Chinese and maybe also others, but do not catch me there). The ticket machine is really easy, nothing complicated like Japanese subway ticket machines.
You get English leaflet and the staff also speaks somehow English, so they are able to explain basic stuff to you as well,

The museum has also restaurant, few vending machines with soft drinks and several toilets. Cannot comment on the restaurant, as I have not used it's service.

If you are looking for an easy spent 2-3 hours, this is the place to be.",
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,The staff are the best,"The museum is good but the staff was the best. Everyone would great us and try to speak english ( no matter their level they tried). We felt so welcome. The staff always warned us before they showed us loud machinery in case our baby would be scared.
This is perfect for car fans, engineering geeks, and we'll everyone. The first half is all about the cloth industry( Toyato started with making fabrics). Then the second half is about cars. On weekends and holidays there are special crafts for kids!","Written May 6, 2017"
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Technical wonders,"I have wanted to visit this museum for the last 4 years I have been here and finally got to go. A fantastic museum, taking you from the early Toyota textiles to the modern Hydrogen cell cars design. With machines working from the textile periods and full demonstrations it is the most interesting museum I have ever been to. Well thought out and so much to hold your interest I'd like me you are a technical buff. The crime de resistance was pressing the button and watching the car being put together, all this for only JPYen500, £3.50, you simply cannot go wrong. You will need 2-3hrs to fully appreciate the place. Also make sure you watch the robot play the violin 👍, this happens hourly at .40.",
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Impressive!,This is a big place so expect to spend at least 2 to 3 hours there. The admission charge is only Y500 for an adult and there's lots to learn. There's also a section for kids (I believe) but I did not go there as the museum closes at 5.

The entrance of the museum was a huge weaving machine, developed and engineered by the Mr.Toyoda's previous business, textile manufacturing. The first section was dedicated to this. As walking along the suggested route. I saw many demonstrations from making cotton seeds into threads then to fabric. This part was well organized and well explained by the staffs as well as the displays The car manufacturing part was less impressive to me, perhaps due to my limited knowledge and interest in mechanics.

I am not a Toyota fan (I prefer VTEC and rotary), but had a good time nonetheless. The exhibits for the textile and automotive production are very detailed, the descriptions and models are great, and the museum is expansive enough (physically and information-wise) that you could spend an entire day if you wanted to.

The only negative is the small collection of antique Toyotas. Only a couple are displayed, which doesn't do Toyota's history (e.g. Celica lineage, the FJs, Supras, MR2s, and unique one-offs such as the Toyota Classic)","Written April 9, 2017"

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Really enjoyable museum to visit,"This museum looks deceptively small from the outside, but there is an amazing amount packed into this museum dedicated to the industrial and technological achievements of the Toyota name.

It seems every effort has been made to make your visit to the museum a memorable one, and it is wonderful - English tours are available, staff stationed at special sections of the museum to demonstrate the workings of devices and buttons for you to press as you walk along and see the huge contributions the Toyota company, especially father and son, Sakichi Toyoda and Kiichiro Toyoda respectively has done not only for Japan but for the world.

This museum was a truly wonderful and educational way to spend an afternoon in Nagoya- I found the staff to be very nice in the museum- they would try their best to explain demonstrations in English, or approach us and help demonstrate particularly inventions that require explanation to fully understand its concept and purpose.

There is a cafe and a souvenir shop after the museum ends, but also a few of Toyota's robots on display, one of which will demonstrate its ability to play the violin every so often (performance times are listed) just outside the souvenir shop. For children (and big children like me), there is a centre called 'technoland' where intelligence games can be enjoyed.","Written March 24, 2017"

The automotive manufacturing section is also outstanding.

The museum Guide Book is probably the best written, most informative museum guide book ever written -- 324 pages!

My suggestion is to spend a few hours in the museum, buy the guide book, read it and then return a day or so later to further learn about what was most interesting.

If you like industrial history, I suggest a solo visit -- because you are unlikely to be able to visit with someone who wants to spend time at the same exhibits you will enjoy.","Written February 10, 2017"

Plenty of demonstrations of the machines actually operating, staff to answer questions. There is a kids play/ experience area called Technoland which would be good for families.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Authentic if you are into Museums!,"Went here on a Sunday afternoon and was very impressed with what was available to see. I am by nature a museum geek and this one was high up on the list for most interesting.

In short, the museum is broke up into 4 main parts:
1) Loomworks
2) Automotive
3) Metal works
4) Technology

I spent a small time in loomworks and a majority in automotive (I work in automotive). In both portions of museum, what amazed me most was the amount of hands on, active exhibitions they had. For the loomworks, there must have been 50 or more loom machines that various workers were operating when people came up.

For the automotive, they had the same type of on hands exhibitions. Specifically, they took you through the different mfg processes of building a car. Forging, Casting, Machining, Pressing, Welding, Painting, Assembly. All of it was super hands on and authentic to real processes.

Cost was so cheap (500 yen + 200 yen optional rental for audio set). The Toyota companies sponsor the museum which makes it so cheap the public.

Capping off the tour were the model cars on the ground floor. Wish I could just drive off in the luxurious Toyopet! But the futuristic Mirai model may well be my next car.

Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,Disneyland for engineers,"I am an engineer and have probably never seen a better museum. It's a combination of that TV show ""how things work"" and an automotive fantasy camp. Sure you get high quality videos of the whole line in many different languages. But only here do you get to see the entire production of cars from raw steel to die casting engine blocks, forging and stamping steel, panel assembly, painting, and final assembly -in person. Even better, you get to run the actual equipment from the 80s (push the button and 30' tall gigantic machinery runs). To top off the experience they have a metal working demonstration where they actually perform the forging etc in small scale and kids can take home a sample. There's ask a kids techno zone where they can drive a car, experience a wind tunnel, and more. Almost everything is in English. For the serious engineer who loves the Smithsonian museums I'd recommend this as a day trip from Tokyo. There's also a hands in area I wish I could have seen - they have sample engines and impact wrenches!",
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,"As a mechanical engineering student, this was heaven.","I had an amazing 4 hours going through this museum. 4 hours wasn't even enough to take a look at everything individually. I wish I had a bit more time to go through everything. The explanations are written well in both Japanese and English. But most of the demonstrations are done in Japanese unless you take the English tour in the afternoon. Nonetheless, I love this place and I would love to go again.","Written August 18, 2016"
Japan,Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology,An Underestimated Visit,"Actually, we'd never stopped by in Nagoya if one of my friends didn't stay there. We were on our way back to Tokyo so there we were, in Nagoya.

My friend didn't even know that this museum is existed, so that was the first time for him as well after been staying in Japan for 6 months.

It was only one station away from Nagoya station, and we didn't have to walk far to reach it.

When we entered, we were exposed to textile museum, different type of cotton, the different of cotton vs others, etc. Frankly speaking, I was not excited to see it. But hey, we're far away from home and put an effort to stop in Nagoya, a-not-so-popular city for Indonesians.

But then it started to change when we were about to reach the next exhibition, then.. We can see the integrated showcases, different type of machines, how the showcase technically explaining the mechanism of a car, and not to mention.. The showcase of retro cars, first generation of the brand lines i.e. 1970 Celica GT, first generation of Camry.. Wow!!

On the background, we could see the showcase on how a car was produced. Our daughter was pretty much excited as well for the kids activities, she can build a toy car from a scratch and got a helpful hand from a granpa (haha) for construct that toy car. At the end, she can bring that toy car for her. She was also allowed to make a keycahin and choose the color. Very interactive.

My husband, spent the most of his time looking at the machines one by one 😄😄 we delayed our departure to Tokyo almost for 4hrs.

By the end of the tour, you can listened to Toyota robot playing a biola by itself. Incredible. You will not regret to visit this museum.","Written August 11, 2016"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Great excursion to the summit of Mt. Moiwa!,"Great excursion involving various forms of transportation to get to the summit of Mt. Moiwa (531m). First you need to take the subway to Susukino subway station (Station N08 on the Namboku Subway Line), then interchange with the Sapporo Streetcar (tram) at street level (Streetcar stop SC23). Take the tram to Ropeway Iriguchi (Streetcar stop SC10); 11-stops anticlockwise or 13-stops in a clockwise direction. Close by the Ropeway tram stop, there is a bus stop with turning circle for the Ropeway shuttle bus; a green 4WD, hi-wheelbase minibus, which takes 5-mins to negotiate the climb up the hill to the Moiwa Base Station.
The 1st leg from Base Station to Mid Station is by Ropeway; the gondola can accommodate up to 66 passengers for the 5-min journey and gondolas depart every 15-mins. At Mid Station you transfer to the Mo-risu Cars which transport you to the Summit Station in 2-mins. The Mo-risu consist of a pair of mini cable cars in tandem; each can hold 30 passengers (60 in total) and also depart every 15-mins.
When I travelled on a January Monday morning, traffic was surprisingly light and blessed with good visibility the views of snow-covered Sapporo from the summit were spectacular. Great excursion, enjoyed the transportation and a special shout-out to Mt. Moiwa Ropeway for giving a discount to Senior Citizens like myself!",

Pros
1) There was a free shuttle from the tram station. As usual, the shuttle driver was helpful especially we had a baby in tow.
2) Went there right after breakfast, which was just right for a family with baby. But it would have been more perfect night time with the city lights view.
3) Weather was nice. Coming from a tropical country, the almost winter weather was nice and cooling.
4) They had several snack shops and a restaurant, so food is not really a problem.
5) Some of my family members opted to hike going up Mt. Moiwa but most of us took the cable car which had amazing views. Mt Moiwa is perfect for hikers!
6) The place was picturesque.
7) There is also a souvenir shop, toilet is not a problem.

To get to Mount Moiwa from the city , take the tram and then the shuttle bus to the base of the ropeway, which goes about two-thirds of the way to the summit.

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,"Mount Moiwa, Wonderful During Winter","I visited Mount Moiwa on 5 February 2020. It was my first time being there on my winter budget trip in Hokkaido, Japan.

Transportation
It is really convenient to reach many places in Hokkaido if you stay near big stations like Sapporo or Odori. I stayed near Sapporo station (I will write about the accommodation in a separate review). I took a walk from the station to Odori station and then Susukino station via underpass including a shopping tunnel called Pole Town to avoid the cold air. The distance between Sapporo and Susukino station is 1.6 km. The duration will depend on the walking speed.

After reaching Susukino station, I took exit with the sign ""Street Car"" then took the tram to reach the closest station to Mount Moiwa, Iriguchi rope way station. It took about 20 minutes to get the rope way station and I paid JPY200 per adult. Child fare was JPY100 per child.

The Street Car line is actually a closed-double-loops (inner and outer), before taking the tram, please make sure that the loop line will stop at Iriguchi rope way station.

From Iriguchi rope way station there are two alternatives to reach Mount Moiwa lower terminal: by walking for about 10 to 15 minutes or by taking the free shuttle bus. I took the free shuttle bus which departed every 15 minutes from 10:45 a.m. since the opening hours of Mount Moiwa is 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. during winter.

At the lower terminal I bought a two-way-ticket for rope way and cable car to reach the highest point of Mount Moiwa. The fare was JPY1,700 per adult for a return trip. Child fare was JPY850 per child. The transfer between rope way and cable car in the middle terminal was very convenient. The duration of both rope way and cable car was about 30 minutes one way including the transfer.

Activities
During winter, the highest point of Mount Moiwa becomes a snow playground which provides scenic views of surrounding mountains and the Sapporo city. When I got there I saw many families with young children playing snow and some people visited and prayed at the small shrine there. There were two favorite spots at Mount Moiwa which attracted many visitors to take pictures at: ""The Fortune Bell"" and ""Love Padlock"". There were also some shops and cafe at the terminal to keep visitors warm from the cold air outside.

Time To Visit
To enjoy the snow playground especially with young children, it is better to visit there at morning or afternoon. To enjoy the Sapporo city view, it is better to visit there at sunset or evening.",

Tip: There are express bus covered by JR pass to and from Sapporo station.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Nice view,Read about this place and decided to try it since it was not too far from our hotel. Took street car then free shuttle bus to the ropeway station. Paid ¥1700 per person for return trip for ropeway and mini cable car. The weather was cold and windy. But the view was fantastic. The cable car was very steady. Feel safe when riding it. From the top we can see the city view. Nice experience and we reached there around 5pm and already dark. Lucky me!,

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Breathtaking,"Japan is surrounded by mountains and we chose to visit Mount Moiwa. It is easy to get to by tram. From the tram station it is a bit of a walk uphill to the entrance. We went in the late afternoon in hope to catch the day and night scene from the top. We were not disappointed. The cable car ride up offers a magnificent view of the mountain side and the city of Hokkaido. You can get off at the first station and walk the remaining distance to the top but we decided to go all the way up. The view of Sapporo at the top was breathtaking. The mountain is only 539mtrs high but the view and experience at the top was absolutely breathtaking for me. On the way up I saw a cemetery at the side of the mountain, a peaceful and beautiful final resting place for sure.","Written December 30, 2019"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Didn't have a good view when I was there (2nd week Dec 2019),"They have a live cam installed at the top of the hill where you can preview the scenery on a TV screen at reception floor, before you purchase the tickets.

It was night time on our first visit there. We were hoping to see the magnificent view but unfortunately, there was heavy snow fall. The receptionist pointed at the TV screen and told us there is no view at that time (from the TV screen it was pitch black).

He was polite enough to apologize to us, although it was the weather and no one could have done anything about it.

We left and visited again a few days later. This time in the afternoon. The weather was fairly good, but still not clear enough. Went up all the same but didn't have a good view of the city.

There isn't much to do there at the top, really. If you're going just for the view, I suppose 30 minutes would be more than enough.

Make sure the sky is 110% clear on your visit, or you'll be disappointed.",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Check the weather before heading to Mt Moiwa!,"The views are astounding, yes... but provided you can see them.

We were in Sapporo for a period of 5 days, but unfortunately when I checked their weather app, it seemed that there was dense fog almost everyday while we were there. Nevertheless we made a trip up - we did see the day view and catch a bit of the sunset, but while we were waiting for the night view, dense fog suddenly hit us. I see the warning alert on the weather app about this dense fog and it looked like it's going to stay, so we cut short our stay at Mt Moiwa and made our way down.

There are quite a lot of visitors who didn't know about the fog (they can't see the fog from below) until they went to the ropeway ticket counter and almost bought the tickets, and that's when they saw the ""real time TV"" that nothing can be seen even if they head up the mountain.

By the way, you can get nice sunset views and photos on the other side of the observation deck (where there wasn't that many tourists). And yes, it is extremely cold. Come prepared with your windproof shell and windproof gloves.",

Anyways, the staff told us we can ride midway for a lower price. Since riding all the way to the top will cost more and also no view because of the fog.

Twilight in summer is best as the clear skies offers a clear view of the mountain on the West. The same can't be said for winter twilight as hazy and cloudy skies obscured this same view.

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Day visit to the mountain near Sapporo,"Drove up to the mountain - mid point, before walking up the remaining 200 m. It is 660 Yen for the toll.
It was extremely difficult to find the entrance, maybe I was searching for the wrong place. Only found the toll highway leading up to the mid-point on my third attempt, leaving little time to enjoy the view.

Decided to walk up the remaining distance as it was supposed to be 200 m. It was exhausting for my family, as we are not the outdoor type. But the locals were moving up the same path relatively fast and with ease.

Walked down from the summit using the 500 m (less physical demanding) as we were quite tired and it was dangerous to use the shorter route.

There were signs to discourage using of the paths at night, in view of safety.
It was not too crowded during the visit at just before noon.
Would consider the night visit in the next visit.","Written June 25, 2019"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Spectacular night view worthy of the effort and time,"Boasts of a spectacular night view of the city.

The cafe was closed when we were there at around 9 pm. Coming down took longer as there was a queue of people waiting for the cable cars.
The view of worth the effort to go. The guide inside the cable cars only spoke in Japanese so we didn’t know what she was saying.
I reckon we took around 2 hrs in all going up and coming down, even if we didn’t linger longer than 20 mins at the top due to all the waiting time taken.",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Skip the insane rush!,"Decided to do this in the late afternoon so I could see the sunset + night view. A definite recommendation but really start early! And don't stay too late!

I was there during the Golden Week holidays in Japan and it was loaded with tourists. Loaded like the lines to go in at 7 PM for the night view were running at least an hour waiting.

I left Sapporo -Odori area by the mini-tram around 430 PM. Get off at Ropeway Iriguchi station. You can pay in the tram with your IC/Passmo card. There is a shuttle bus to take you to the rope way station. If you can walk, it's a 15 min quick walk. Skip the bus. You have to wait some.

There will be two cable cars to take you up to the top. One takes you to the base, the next one takes you to the top.

I got there at 530 pm, saw the sun set which was by about 630-645 pm and I started to head back at 7 pm. By this time the rush was MANIC to see the night view.
The sunset is amazing on the other side of the same viewing platform with no people to push you around or cameras in your face.

At 7 pm, on the way down in a not so crowded cable car you will see a pretty fantastic view of Sapporo un-hindered by the crowds. And to me this is worth it than standing in lines to first go up and then stand in unending lines to then come down...do the smart thing ;)

Getting the tram from Sapporo, there's a complementary shuttle service to the rope-way a 50m walk from the stop which I would highly recommend taking advantage of in winter. In summer I assume the walk to the ropeway (10-15mins) would be a nice stroll, however in winter the ice can cause some problems while hiking up to the entrance.

After purchasing our tickets, we entered the gondola and proceeded up the mountain. I was on the look out for any wild animals in the snow below (I didn't see any), but still took the time to appreciate the spectacular views as we went up the mountain.

When we reached the top it was quite clear we were amongst the first to reach the summit as the snow was untouched. We quickly went about changing that, throwing snowballs and making snow angels in the powder. From there we wandered around, went to the 'lovers tower' (though none of us were coupled up) and walked around the small shrine-like structure. You can also do walks from the top, however our group was not equipped for it.

It was quite cloudy when we went up, so we didn't get the views from the top. When you purchase your tickets below there is a current visibility rating so we knew this would be the case. It was still worth the time to go up to the top, and the views available on the gondola ride were a great consolation.

The restaurant/kiosk opens around 1pm, however if you want a warm drink there is a vending machine inside. You can also pack your own food and eat in the rest area below the restaurant which offers floor to ceiling views out into the snow.

Before leaving I bought a few cute souvenirs from the gift shop, then it was back out into the city. We spent roughly two hours up the top taking photos and horsing around.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Beautiful view of Saporro!!,I went there on a winter and and everything was so white and pristine... Beautiful place! You go up and down Mt Moiwa in a cable car.

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Best view of Sapporo,Great view of Sapporo. We gladly paid to use the ropeway and the rail car to go to the top of the mountain. The star projection in the little movie theater at the top of the mountain is not really interesting for people who don't understand Japanese.,
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,The Bell of Happiness!,"With a big family in tow, it was quite a struggle to go up to Mt. Moiwa. There were several transfers before reaching the place but it was worth it! It might not be as high up as the mountains we went up to in Switzerland with cable cars, but Mt. Moiwa has its own charm. Before going up, there was a monitor where you can see the conditions at the top, for you to decide if you wanted to go with not so clear views because of winter weather. It was cloudy when we reached there but hey, we didn’t travel all the way there just to be deterred by a few clouds. And so up we went, and reached the top, and rang the bell of happiness!",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Amazing place with amazon msg view of the city,"The place offers you an amazing view of Sapporo city and Ishikari bay.

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Worth doing during the day too!,"Last December 18 my family went to Mt Moiwa, it was an awesome experience, the view was so beautiful, the trip on the way itself was a beautiful experience.
We rode the tramp for the first time, The driver was so polite and kind to us. After the tramp we took the free shuttle bus to the cable station. There are 2 rides to the top.
The view was breathtaking, not only on top but also on the way.
On our way down they have a wide open for children to enjoy snow. If you have children take the time to go there.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Beautiful night view.,"We visited on Dec 26th, taking a taxi from Okurayama Ski Jump. It was a short 6km ride costing approximately 1500yen for 4 of us.
We left OSJ around 4.30pm, timing it such that we would get to Mt.Moiwa when it was dark. We read that the night views, because of the city lights were beautiful.
The ride on the ropeway and cable car was orderly and packed but offered lovely views of the city. It was extremely cold in the open areas and there is a Cafe at midpoint whe you could enjoy hot drinks, snacks and the view.

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Things to do at night,"Free shuttle bus from the streetbus (tram) station Ropeway Iriguchi. Also a good opportunity to try other local restaurants in the neighborhood away from the usual tourist areas like Sapporo train station, Odori or Susukino.

Mount Moiwa is a very popular tourist spot, even among the Japanese domestic tourists. Nonetheless, all the queues are only 10~15 minutes and always in order.

There is a restaurant on the mountain called Jewel but it closes at around 9pm, last order is 8 or 830pm. Price for two legs round trip to the middle and top of the mountain, total ride less than 8min, costs about Jpy 1700.

I wouldn't say the Sapporo nightview is absolutely breathtaking but it is still a nice thing to do at night.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Visit Mt Moiwa for a gorgeous night view of Sapporo,"We visited Mt Moiwa on our first night in Sapporo. We decided to go there at night so we could view the bright city lights. We visited on an autumn night and it was pretty chilly so if you're doing the same thing,be sure to dress warmly. We took as many photos as we can, rang the bell (which was all lit up at night) then went back down to buy some stuff at the souvenir shop. While we didn't spend a lot of time in this place,I would still say that it was worth the visit.","Written October 30, 2018"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Sapporo Under Your Nose,"Mt. Moiwa boasts the best spot to view the city of Sapporo, and it did draw lots of people even on a rainy, humid August night. As you might have already learned, you need to take two different gondolas to get to the top. As the gondola sent us upward, the nightly cityscape slowly and elegantly came into view, despite the annoyingly unstoppable rain. Reaching the top, well, the expected sense of excitement did not kick in. I guess it's again because of the rain. We didn't stay long as there was no shelter or awning where we could temporarily shun the raindrops. Maybe we should have come during the day time? Some afterthought after all this? The small windfall of riding on the city tram, which was very different from riding the metro. (To get to Mt. Moiwa, you either have to hop on a tram (streetcar), or hire a taxi.)",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Peak is for lovers,"Mt Moiwa can be reached by a cable car. It is one of highest mountains in the Sapporo area.The peak has a bell, which lovers can ring to ensure eternal love, and also attach a padlock to the railing. The view from Mt Moiwa is gratifying. The peak is over 500 metres (1640 feet) above sea level. You can dine at Jewels Restaurant at the peak, make a reservation, it is often booked out. Tram is probably the best way to get to the base of the mountain.is b y tram (streetcar).","Written October 3, 2018"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Honestly.....,"Don't really know what the fuss is about...to get there u need to get into a street tram, then get on a shuttle bus, then pay to get on a ropeway (which is basically a cable car) to the middle level, then a transfer to a smaller cable car to get to the summit.

You do get a nice view of Sapporo and if you can aim to be there around sunset to catch the sunset and the night lights of Sapporo.

It does get pretty cold up there so bring a sweater

the whole experience will cost around 2100 yen each...including the tram ride...so it's not cheap..","Written September 30, 2018"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Not worth the trip,"Cloudy day on visit nearing sunset. The view was nothing wow, ticket to the top was not worth the experience. City view was so-so, everything is so tiny. Might as well skip this and Google sapporo City view instead. Lover's Sanctuary is kinda gimmicky.

These are one of the best shots I got.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,How to Get There (Using Tram),"Easy way to get there is to take the tram (streetcar). There’s only one tram line and it makes a loop through the city. The Ropeway Iriguchi tram stop where you want to get off is about half way around the loop if you get on where most tourists do: on the street above the Susukino subway stop. So you can’t get on the wrong tram or go the wrong way. Riding the tram is a fun & cheap way to get a tour of the City’s various neighborhoods. The trams run on parallel tracks in opposite directions: some go clockwise around the loop and others go counter-clockwise. At Susukino, there are two separate tram stations, one for each direction, around the corner from each other. The tram stations have a video display that shows the whole loop and where each tram is on the loop in real time, so you can see where the oncoming tram is. If it’s too far away, you can cross the street to get the tram going the other direction. Check how many people are getting on – locals use the tram for commuting so, for example, in the afternoon the trams going counter-clockwise are much more crowded than the ones going clockwise from the Susukino station. Like buses, you get on in the middle of the tram and exit out the front door, paying at the farebox as you leave. Fare is a flat ¥200 for adults no matter how far you go. It’s best if you have an IC commuter card so you can pay by touch instead of fumbling for coins. At the Ropeway Iriguchi station, the free shuttle bus is diagonally across the intersection. You can’t miss it because there’s an obvious bus turnout there and anyway half the passengers on the tram will be walking there. Most people ride the bus even though the Ropeway is only a few blocks away, because it is steeply uphill. Getting on the cable car, go to the back of the car since as the car travels up the mountain the views of the city are in the back. Up front, all you see are trees. Once at the top, my tip is to buy the roasted potato cheese stick. Looks like a roasted popsicle made of mashed potato. It’s one of those simple hot snacks that are unbelievably good. So good I had to buy a second one.","Written September 1, 2018"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Great views and good hiking,"We hiked up this mountain, using directions provided from an internet search. The hike up took us slightly more than an hour on a well-marked and we'll-travelled trail, past many Buddhist statues and local residents also hiking. The trail was slightly muddy due to recent rain. At the top there is a building with viewing platform and lounges as well as a snack bar and gift shop. A Buddhist shrine is also at the top. Since rain started while we were there, we took the incline/cable car down. All of Sapporo can be seen from the top. Although we were there during daylight, it is supposed to be one of the best views in Japan at night.","Written August 22, 2018"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Great Morning Hike,"So you can take the cable car if you want to, but I went with a group of people hiking up the trail. The trail is super well maintained and should be doable for all ages as long as you're physically fit enough to hike uphill. The top is a very beautiful view. I went in the morning, but the night view is famous. If hiking isn't your thing, there is a cable car that goes straight up to the top.

Try to time it where you're not there at the same time as a tour group/bus, though.",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Great View of Sapporo,"I brought my two sons and my daughter-in-law to Sapporo for a few days in July and we planned on going to Mt. Moiwa on July 14th. However, the rainy weather forced us to cancel those plans because the cloud cover was very bad on that day and the weather forced us to go underground for that day.

The weather was great on July 18th and we made to Mt. Moiwa at 10:30 in the morning. We were in the first car up the hill, and the view was real nice. You don't realize how big Sapproro is until you see it fro the top of Mt. Moiwa. The city just unfolds below you and you can see it just spread out before you. Just a great view.

The ropeway and cogged cable car ride are really cool. On the way down on the ropeway, I was able to sit in the front and got some really cool videos of the descent to the main station. A really good trip with some really good views of the city.","Written July 20, 2018"

It was windy and cold on our visit to the top, but that probably kept the crowd sizes down. Actually, there weren't many people there at all. There's a little café area at the upper station where it seemed that most people (like us) brought our own food. The ride up and down on the ropeway was also enjoyable.

There is a planetalium every 30 min. If you want to see it, you need to check the time when you alive.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Go after dark,"To avoid too many people we went to the top before sun set. Unfortunately, the weather was not with us and it was windy and raining. The shuttle bus from the tram station is relatively small so it will not be able to cope with large input of guests. The day view from the mountain was ok. A restaurant is present but was closed during our visit in the afternoon. There was not many seats so after seeing all the views from different angle we decided to retreat from the top to go somewhere warmer.

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,"Nice view, convenient access from Sapporo","The reason why you should go to the top of Mt. Moiwa is that there is not really any reason why you should not. Not every city has a ropeway up a hill from which you can get a great view, but Sapporo does. So why not go up there and enjoy the view?

It is very convenient to get to the top and not too expensive either. You can take the shuttle bus from the tram station, but it is really only a short walk. The ropeway and cable car is a nice ride. There is friendly staff in uniform everywhere who bow and show you where to go.

Up at the top you get a reasonably impressive view of the city and the surrounding mountains. There is even a vending machine where you can get a hot coffee to warm up your hands if they are freezing from taking all the photos. You can buy souvenirs with the cute Mt. Moiwa mascot at the middle station, but they seem overpriced.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,What a view!,Although it was hazy the view was stunning and well worth the trip to the top. Of course had to ring the bell for many many years of love!,

The bell looks beautiful particularly at night, but we just cannot manage to take any photos with the same angle as the advertisement. What we can capture in the photo is either the night scene or the bell. As for the night scene, it is so so compared to the one in Hakodate.

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Highlight of our Japan trip,"I always wanted to visit Sapporo, Hokkaido for their cute food and beer even though I dont drink. Some people say that they have good parks.
So I prepared for parks itinerary while in Sapporo. But when I touched down Sapporo last week, I read review that Mt. Moiwa is one of best three night views in Hokkaido.

I used google to give direction to go to Mt. Moiwa, suggested as follow: From Nishi Juitchome subway, we needed to go out from subway station and found for tram to go to Chuotoshokan-Mae stop and walked to ropeway station for 15 mins (The walking road was nice but it was uphill). BUT it was wrong.
One stop before Chuotoshokan-Mae, there was Ropeway Iriguchi (which I saw it but I thought it was for another ropeway, -my bad) and from that stop we only needed to cross the street to find FREE shuttle bus to go up to Mt. Moiwa ropeway station. We found that correct route and way after we went back walking down to tramp stop station (this time to ropeway Iriguchi) and saw that free shuttle bus stop.
Actually it has been written by some bloggers but since I didn't prepare for Mt. Moiwa, I did miss it.
I felt sorry for my mom to experience uphill walking in windy and cold.

Ok, so from Mt. Moiwa ropeway, we bought ropeway ticket return Yen 1.100. Once you were in ropeway you need to go to left side so you can see beautiful Sapporo night city view from above. The ropeway stop at Midway station and we countinued by bus to go to observatory of Mt. Moiwa. The view from ropeway was beautiful but the view from the observatory was breathtaking and sooo windy and cold. We even couldn't dare to stay longer for taking pictures. It is indeed one of one of best three night views in Hokkaido.

Our time in Sapporo, Hokkaido was so limited and now I'm so looking forward to have chance to go back to Hokkaido.
The park was nice and I can imagine myself in future at that park for cherry blossom.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Shuttle Bus to Mt Moiwa,It's a must write for me on the early part of the Mt. Moiwa trip. We slighted at the station of Ropeway Iriguchi to take the free shuttle bus to the ropeway.

I'm super impressed being someone in the hospitality industry. Thumbs upx3,"Written April 23, 2018"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Mt Moiwa,"This place is a must see regardless of crowd. We went there in early October. Do bring warm clothes because it is cold and windy up there. We took the street car (tram) from Susukino to Ropeway Iriguchi station (170 yen). From there there is a free shuttle bus that goes to the lower ropeway station, or you can walk the way (not very far). Then you take the Ropeway to the top (1700 yen roundtrip with mini cable car). This is the one I would suggest especially if you intend to go at night, so you don't have to walk down. It opens from 10:30am to 10 pm and from 12pm to 10pm (winter). You can find all the details in English on their website. The view over Sapporo is amazing... and if you go around sunset, even better...which we did. It was really windy and cold but we loved the view and felt it was all worth it.
They have signs on their walking path to be aware of bears!!! hence the ropeway! They also have a restaurant and some souvenir shops.

Check their website for maintenance time when service is suspended!",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Lovely night views,"Wasnt that easy to find the route up considering its one of the main tourist attractions. There were no signage of directions from the nearest streetcar stop (Denshajigyosho-Mae). However, once you've braved the 15 minutes trek to the ropeway building, it's a nice ride up to the summit. We went at 7 pm, so we missed the day time crowd and the after dinner crowd.
The night views are very nice on a clear night. In mid April, there's still some snow from midway up.
There's a bell you can ring at the summit... For fun 😄
1.5 hours is more than sufficient for this attraction.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Incredible and highly recommended!,"We visited here at night right after the sunset (I wish we could have seen the sunset). It was an incredible experience. Riding the ski lift to the top of the mountain, you could see all of Sapporo with all the buildings and lights. There is so much life in Sapporo! The first ski lift was about 4-5 minutes and then you take another short ride to the very top.

You have to pay for the lifts and it is about $6 USD per person for the round trip tickets... well worth the price.

Once we got to the very top of the mountain you walk up the stairs to the top floor where you can walk outside and view the whole city. It was incredibly cold when we went and it was also snowing, which was really nice... though the visibility was low. Even with low visibility, it was still an incredible experience. I would like to return for sunrise and sunset one day, if possible.

They also have a general store and restaurant inside the building. It is a really nice place and certainly something you should do if you visit Sapporo!",

The beginners slope is not as well arranged for learners as other ski fields I’ve been to, so not really the best place to start for our novices. Getting a private ski instructor who spoke English was a struggle, though successful and very expensive, and reading most kanji signage was not English tourist friendly either. No snowboards are permitted. We were there on a Monday, and no catering was available, other than vending machine drinks. Then on her last run of the day, the 10 year old novice fell over, yet again, but this time resulting in a spiral fracture of one of her tibias. I never saw the ski patrol folks anywhere other than sitting in their office. I skied her down the slope to the first aid post where little was done. Only found out it was a fracture two days later after our return flight, in an Australian hospital!","Written April 2, 2018"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Great Place for Night Views,"I heard of this place through here and I just had to check it out. I went close to 9 pm this past Wednesday night, hoping there would be a smaller crowd. We made it before the last free shuttle and we were rewarded with spectacular views! I recommend a good jacket for this time of year even though it’s not snowing as much because the winds up at the top made it pretty chilly! To get there from Susukino, we took the streetcar to the free shuttle (12 stops), took the shuttle (5 minutes), then took the cable car to the top. It’s definit worth checking out at night!","Written April 1, 2018"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Amazing View,"You can access the peak of Mt. Moiwa by riding the ropeway and then transferring to the cable car. The ropeway that departs from Moiwa Sanroku Station travels 1,200 meters in five minutes. The ride includes the stunning view of Ishikari Bay in the distance past the cityscape, providing clear, unobstructed views of Sapporo. Next, transfer to the cable car called Mo-risu Car, which brings you to the peak after traveling through the forest. Be sure to check out the views from both the ropeway and cable car.

The place had an amount of tourists and locals.

You can purchase locks at their gift shop for 1000yen. But I recommend you to get locks from your own country or at the 100 yen shop. If you get your own locks, bring your own markers as they only provide markers for people who buy their locks.

You couldn't stay out long but ringing the bell gave a nice photo opportunity . Cable car was cramped ,but if you were by the window you had a good view. Free shuttle bus and tram ride to the foot of the mountain worked well. Food very disappointing , the restaurant was full and the little counter served hot drinks, a poor range of snacks and no where inside to sit. The few seats there were taken up with people ignoring the view sat on phones. A missed opportunity maybe on the middle section for a better cafe, we would have stayed longer. Fireworks ... Well we had seen a poster and thought there would be fireworks, no mention on line , no other posters , no signs when we arrived so we walked around and headed back down, only to see fireworks from the cable car ,very disappointing, should have been better advertised!","Written February 10, 2018"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Pretty nice views of Sapporo albeit a little expensive,"Those going during winter may want to keep a lookout for the shuttle to the ropeway base station near the streetcar stop instead of walking because it can get really cold trekking up the hill.

The views are good up there if you go on a clear day (during winter). We also saw locals ski down from the mid-level station and trek down from the top which is interesting.

Why I feel the fee charged is expensive is because there aren't much facilities and this place is rather small so you wouldn't spend much time there and will leave probably after a few pictures.","Written February 5, 2018"

The mountains all around Sapporo are beautiful, but the coolest thing was seeing Ishikari Bay spread out below to the west. The map of Hokkaido felt like it had come to life in front of us. The ropeway ride was really fun--we could see a man walking his dog in the snow below us--and I wish we had more time to stay up at the top. We will have to go again for the famous night view. We took the streetcar and walked to the Ropeway, arriving a minute after the free shuttle bus. It is a pleasant uphill walk if you don't want to wait for the bus.","Written January 7, 2018"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,A view out.,"There's the ropeway to a midway station, then a cable car up. You can get tickets to just the midway station, but you can't really see much from there, and there's no dedicated viewing platform. Pay the extra amount to go all the way to the top, and you will be rewarded with a panoramic view over the city. Great to see it and the lights at night. Beware of slippery frost on the ground of the viewing area in cold weather though, and bring warm clothing. It was about 2 degrees C outside when we were there.
Also, despite the brochure saying the ropeway cars and cable cars have been designed to give you a great view of the surrounds as you ascend/descend, realistically, you will be packed in with over 20 other people (closer to 30), and unless you're right on the edges, you won't see much.","Written November 4, 2017"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Better than Mt Hakodate,"Sapporo Mount Moiwa

This tourist destination is recommended. You may go up the peak either in the day or at night. I think the night view is even better than that of Mt Hakodate. According to the brochure, during the “Nightscape Summit 2015 in Kobe”, Sapporo Mt Moiwa was chosen along with Nagasaki and Kobe as one of the three most beautiful nightscapes of Japan.

To take the tram (streetcar) and alight at Ropeway Iriguchi station. Walk along the main road with Mt. Moiwa signboard to the shuttle bus pick up point on the left. The free shuttle bus will ferry you to the ropeway station. If you are a senior above 65 years, there is a discounted ticket available. The ropeway climbs from the base of the mountain to the transfer station. From here, you will be transferred to an unique twin cable cars to the peak.

The observatory at the peak offer you spectacular view of Sapporo city. The view is especially beautiful after sunset. Mount Moiwa offers five mountain trails too. The shortest is 2.4 km and you may hike in casual clothing. You may wish to venture into it.","Written September 16, 2017"

Moiwa early morning from the Jiekaibyoin Mae Course Parking Lot for a moderate hike that took about one hour to complete. Once done, I emerged at the observatory on a beautiful sunny day with 360 degree views of the entire area that stretched for miles. Since I went early, there were few people and it was quiet, which made for a good time of reflection and calm. On the way down, I decided to take the Ropeway cable car down to Sanroku and a short walk to the tram line. Overall best views you will find (and if you take the cable car, it is an inexpensive ride with the most calming background music ever).",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,"A great hike, with incredible views.","Do it properly and hike up. It's not a particularly long or hard climb (an hour up at most), and makes the views at the top even better.

I took a street tram to the Mt Moiwa shuttle bus stop and then took the free shuttle up to the building. I thought that the tickets for the ropeway and cable car were a bit pricey.

At the middle stop, there's a souvenir shop with some cool stuff. There's a lock fence at the summit, like the one in Paris. You can buy the locks and markers for it here.

I went during the week so the summit was not crowded. There were mostly older people. I also saw a lot of people in hiking gear so I think it's possible to hike there.

I would like to go back sometime and see the views at sunset or at night.",

Now you can buy a one way ticket for 900yen but I don't know how you would get back down. I think there is a hiking/walking path but I am not sure. Once you reach the top of the ropeway you then have to take a cable car which takes uou to the top of the mountain. From the top it's a great view of the city with all of the lights twinkling from the city.

Even though the views from the top were super foggy (really couldn't see anything), the views of the city as we ascended the mountain were clear and really nice. Even going outside was cold but rather pleasant. Other than the view though, there is not much to do here apart from the shop.

Still we preserved. Then another 20 mins to the first tram. Then when we reached the top, the horror descended upon us as the snake of people waiting to get down was like more than an hour long.

We went during the afternoon, so we didn't get to see the bright lights of the Sapporo landscape, which is rated as top 3 in all of Japan. We recommend a total of 1.5 hours for this trip. You may have dinner there, but the food is average. They are selling the view, which you may see at the observatory deck.

If you want to save some money and enjoy some hiking, may I suggest getting a one way ticket up to the top and walk your way down, it takes around 30 minutes at a leisurely pace and soaking in the landscape.

Ring the bell, just remember to cover your ears. With my height, my head was right next to the bell, which leaves ringing for some time.","Written May 20, 2017"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,May better going there at night,"I'm going there at noon during the cloudy day, so nothing much to see. I suggest to go there at night so you can see the view better, but it depends on the weather.","Written May 17, 2017"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Minimal views at the top on a foggy day,"We came here on a cold day, got to the desk to buy tickets and was so sad when we were told that the views up the top were very foggy and we wouldn't be able to see anything. They have live cam (which it turns out is pretty accurate). We had taken the tram and then the mini bus to get to the rope way thing, so we decided what the hell. We were going up anyway.

Even though the views from the top were super foggy (really couldn't see anything), the views of the city as we ascended the mountain were clear and really nice. Even going outside was cold but rather pleasant. Other than the view though, there is not much to do here apart from the shop.

I guess my tip is that the live cam is really accurate. The view was pretty much exactly as the camera portrayed it. But you will probably get lovely city views on the way up to the mountain anyway.","Written May 15, 2017"

Still we preserved. Then another 20 mins to the first tram. Then when we reached the top, the horror descended upon us as the snake of people waiting to get down was like more than an hour long. Didn't help as we were hungry. So while the view is fantastic, the whole experience didn't go down well at all. The whole trip took 2.5 hours which probably would be just over an hour. Be warned.",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Great hike to do on a clear day,"Definitely recommend this hike while in Sapporo. Took us about an hour to go up; slow and steady with no stops. The same going back down. The views at the top were fabulous. Could see the Sea of Japan from the top, and heaps of snow capped peaks in the distance.

The trailhead isn't from the ropeway! You need to get off the tram at stop 14. Walk towards the mountain. At the trailhead, there is some public toilets as well as a large three headed Buddha statue. See that and you'll know you've arrived.

We had a few snow patches to cross in early May, but nothing too serious. There is a place at the trailhead to wash your boots when you have finished (stiff brushes provided), which was great. There are also a few walking poles there, that you can use, then put back when you are finished, if you didn't bring your own.

We packed a picnic lunch for the top, which was great.","Written May 3, 2017"

The next night we drive to the ropeway station and go up through Sanroku.

The view is really amazing. We didnt stay there long as it was really cold. But i think it worths the money and the time we spent.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Stunning views,"Worth the trip for the views alone. The beginning of the ropeway is easy to get to from the centre of the city via the Ropeway Iriguchi streetcar stop and the ropeway itself runs every 15 minutes. You get a short talk pointing out famous landmarks on the way up (Japanese only unfortunately) and there are amenities and a restaurant at the top.

Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that 1700 yen seemed a bit steep given how short the journey is.","Written March 18, 2017"

This is a must especially during winter when the entire city is snow-capped.","Written February 20, 2017"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Beautiful Night View!,"Visited Mt. Moiwa in the winter while in Sapporo for the Snow Festival. Very easy access taking the city's only street car and then the free shuttle bus to the cable car station. As roads can be quite icy, it is highly recommended to take the shuttle bus during the winter than to walk up to the station.

The view from taking the cable car up was great, could see the snow covered roofs of the city buildings. There's a shop at the midstation before taking the morris car to the top. The night view was stunning on a clear night, full view of the city down below.

For those who want to enjoy the view longer and in comfort, there is a fancy restaurant there too.",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,See the whole of Sapporo,"Mt Moiwa (Moiwayama) is right inside Sapporo with two lifts, hiking trails, skiing, and neat views of the whole city.

How to get there: from the central city, take a streetcar to the Ropeway station. You can walk about 600m to the entrance - turn left when you see the sign for ropeway parking- or take a free shuttle about 50m from the streetcar. The entrance is labeled and looks like an office building. When we went, the path was icy, and some of it is uphill; not safe for elderly or very young children.

How to tickets: Go to the fourth floor via elevator or stairs to the right. You will be deposited in a ticket line. The workers speak English, and you can use a credit card. The cost for round trip tickets on both the doorway and mini cable car was ¥1700 per adult. There were coupons in the Sapporo guide we were given at the airport; alas, we did not know and did. It bring them.

How to get to the top: the rope way and mini cable cars leave every 15 minutes. The first trip takes about 5 minutes, get a view facing down to watch the city unfurl beneath you! Then, you can buy items at the shop, leave for hiking (we did not try it on a February night), or go up the mini cable car. The second trip is just about 2 minutes. Go out the Rooftop observation deck.

What to do: Get your picture ringing the bell on top of Sapporo. Look at the pictures indicating key sites in the city and natural landmarks. You can eat at a restaurant at the top (we didn't) and head back down.

If you can't get to ant Moiwa and still want to see the city, you can go to observation decks in JR tower near Sapporo station or the clock tower in Odari park. Neither is nearly as high, though.","Written February 6, 2017"

You may purchase a one day pass (Dosanko Pass 310Y) for the streetcar if you are travelling during weekend or holidays for unlimited ride for a day. From Ropeway Irigiuchi, the free shuttle bus to the Mt. Moiwa Ropeway is within walking distance. The free shuttle bus was pretty efficient that we took no time to wait for it during our trip to and fro. Once you reached there, you may take lift up to the ticket counter and we found discount coupon at HIS website prior to our trip.So we get 500 yen of discount and free kairo (hot pack) for roundway trip (1200 yen). On the day we went, the weather was pretty good and sun was shinning brightly but it still cold. Once you reached the top, you can see the whole view of Sapporo. Do take note there is also bell of Happiness and padlock for lovers. Remember to check whether the ropeway is operating or not during the day of your visit to avoid any disappointment. If you wish to see the night view during winter, it is best to go during 16.00 to capture both day and night and also sunset view. You will never want to miss the view here if you have come to Hokkaido. It is one of the best attractions here other than Mt. Hakodate.","Written February 3, 2017"

The best way to get Mt. Moiwa is to use city tram loop. You'll need station ""ロープウエイ入口"" (rōpu uei iriguchi). Price for. Tram is 170円 w/o price zones. Take a look inside a car, normally you can find there free coupons in the pockets with printing give aways for ropeway to Mt.

Depend the way you've came this station (clockwise or counter clockwise) go to to left (in case of clockwise tram way) or right in other case. There will be small bus stop where free bus shuttle to Ropeway station is going. Take this shuttle, 5 min and you are there.

Do bring a jacket as it gets chilly and there are some strong winds. If you have no time to go out of the city and just want a feel of snow, there's quite a bit of snow on the mountains. I saw parents bringing their kids out to take photos and play around in the snow.
Check out the panoramic views! You can even attach a padlock lock to the railings and ring the bell. It is supposed to bring lovers good luck and happiness. Drinks and food in winter are a little scarce. I remember having to crowd around a counter as the restaurant was closed.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,"Sapporo from ""far above"" :)","Saw this city from three different heights: one on top of the JR Tower above Sapporo Station, one on top of Mt. Moere at Moerenuma Park to the north of the city, and one on top of this mountain to the south of the city; but if you want an ""absolute panoramic"" view of the city, the big deck on top of this mountain is where you come although the location of the mountain being in the southwest of the city means you'll have to look ""north & east"" to see most of the city (there are really just mountains to the west & there's nothing much to the south either, but be sure to look to the southwest for some ""interesting shapes"" on the slopes & at the foot of some mountains there). And yes, besides taking in the phenomenal views, there are things to see & do on the top deck such as the bell (I guess for love or peace), the love locks & the love sign (for great photo-ops), and in the building right below which has a cafe and a movie room where you can watch a nice short movie (just about 15 minutes, but it's ""3-D"") about the history of the Sapporo area from the prehistoric time (when the area was kind of like a sea) to the present. Also, be sure to step outside the building and check out the little lovely shrine building (like hexagonal-shaped) on the west side beside the big satellite tower.

You could take both cable cars (the first one from the bottom station to the mid station and the second one from the mid station to the top station) costing a total of like Y1,800 or you can save a few hundred yens by doing the stretch from the mid station to the top and vice-versa ""on foot"" (I only did that part on foot on my way down which took only about 10 minutes and saved me like Y300, but I wished then that I had walked up as well from the mid station after finding out how easy the paved path was with a gentle slope to the top; would have saved Y600 instead of just Y300).

I took the tram (or streetcar) from Nishiyonchome Station (just like two blocks south of Odori Park in downtown) to Ropeway Iriguchi Station where there's a shuttle bus (free of charge) just across the street from that station, and a short 5-minute ride on it will bring you to the bottom station for the cable car which takes you to the mid station where I suggest just to walk up on the easy path (as mentioned above although the way up that I didn't do by taking the second cable car instead might take a bit more than 10 minutes).",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,A great place for Sapporo night view,"We walked from Sapporo Station to Streetcar Station_Nishi yon chome (Stop nr. SC01) near Odori Park. The ride from SC01 to Ropeway iriguchi (Stop nr. SC10) took about 30 minutes . After getting off the streetcar, we crossed the road to the left, walked about 1 minute and found the Mt. Moiwa Shuttle Bus Stop. The free shuttle operated at regular intervals between the Shuttle Bus Stop and the Mt. Moiwa Ropeway Station. Timetable was displayed at the station.
At Mt. Moiwa Ropeway Station, we bought return tickets to/from the summit which we had to change to ""Morris Car""(mini cable car) half way. It was completely dark when we reached the summit and the panorama night view of Sapporo was so stunning. It's definitely worth to visit Mt. Moiwa at night.

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Need a good weather,"On our last day in Sapporo, we went to Mt Moiwa. Unfortunately, it was rainy and did not get much view of the area. From the photo gallery, we saw what we missed out on. There was some 3D sessions on Sapporo which was quite good, just that they were all in Japanese.","Written September 14, 2016"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Nice view,We went to Mt. Moiwa for the night view of Sapporo. It was quite nice but was very crowded (I think it was a public holiday at the time). I believe there is a free shuttle from downtown Sapporo that takes you to the cable car station at the bottom of the mountain. We travelled by car to the mid-mountain station which cost 600 yen for a family sized car. Then it's another 600 yen per person to ride the cable car to the top.,"Written August 30, 2016"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,One of the highlights of my trip in Hokkaido,"I personally like the whole concept of reaching the mountain top observatory with a cable car. The view from the top was just unbelievably stunning. As we reached the top at around 8PM, the lights that decorate Sapporo just looked fantastic. Practically everyone in the cable car couldn't stop saying how beautiful the view was when it starts ascending to the top. Keep in mind that you need to wait for 20-30 minutes to purchase the ticket(s) to get to the top (or 2nd station). I definitely recommend going all the way to the top, which will cost you 1.700Yen (round trip). Going to the second station will cost you 1.100Yen (round trip). Trust me, the view that you get worth every waiting minute.",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Top of the Mountain...... But Terrible Customer Services.,It was a typical top of the mountain view. We drove up instead of paying Ropeway which is a cable car to the top. It is much cheaper. The toll cost was 600 Yens as compared to 1560 yens per person. But we still need to pay again before they take you up by tram to the top of the mountain. We ended up picking up some local souvenirs. the cashier does not speak english and she made sure you know as well!...so don't ask any questions... We picked up some stuff by mistakes but she gave us a dirty look... Not impressed at all. But this is Japan... I recommend a night viewing instead...,"Written August 4, 2016"

It takes around one hour for us to arrive the shuttle bus station but the shuttle bus comes frequently like every 10-15mins and convenient to go to cable car station. It takes two cable cars to reach the top and if you try to only take one cable car to the half way. You can't see the whole view only part of it because the view will be blocked by the cable car station. Remember to buy the souvenir first before taking the second cable car to the top of its close to 9pm. The night view is quite amazing if the weather is good. It totally deserves your time to go to take a look. It has been selected to one of the new top three best night view cities.","Written July 26, 2016"

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Panaromic view of Sapporo city and surrounding mountain range,"A must go place in Sapporo. Evening time is the best time to go on a sunny day. As the sun shone on the city during sunset, the view was spectacular on evening sunshine reflection.
Since we rented a car we decided to drive up and paid a toll of 660 yen instead of 1700 yen per person using ropeway which is really expensive. Unfortunately we can't drive all the way up to the top. From the car park, we can either hike up which is free and a bit of exercise or take less than a minute mini cable car up at 600 yen per person return trip. If it's a nice weather I would suggest hike up as it wasn't that high.
It was quite cold and windy up there. Prepare jacket even on a summer day. We stayed until sunset is over but left before totally dark because it was too cold.","Written July 13, 2016"

There is also a shop selling foodstuff and souvenir items in the middle part while waiting your cable car ride to the top.,"Written June 30, 2016"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Mt Moiwa Good Tourist Place,Mt Moiwa is located right within Sapporo. Easily accessible by electric street tram at a very reasonable price you can get on or get off along the main Susukino street. A 2 stage cable car takes visitors right to the summit. Clear excellent view of Sapporo city skyline. Very pleasant and enjoyable cable car ride. They provide free shuttle bus services from the street car stop. The street car drivers even provide visitors with discount coupons. DO NOT TAKE A LOCAL TOUR TO VISIT MT MOIWA. Very easy expensive and lots of spoken Japanese. If you find your way via the underground pedestrian walk or by subway to Susukino you can take the charming street car right to Mt Moiwa all for a fraction of the price of a local tour. Besides you can take your dinner at Susukino and enjoy the very charming circle street car ride. Highly recommended,"Written June 29, 2016"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,What a view,"We went just as the sun was setting on a clear night so the view was fantastic. The stars were out and we spent quite a while despite the windy chill. It can get quite crowded. And if you don't understand Japanese, skip the planetarium show.",
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Crowded cable car on a cold windy night,"We drove up the Mount Moiwa sightseeing road. We had to pay a toll for driving up this scenic road. However, we didn't realize this sightseeing road only brings us half way up, where we have to park our car & take a cable car that cost ¥600 per person to get to the top for viewing the city night view.

We were going up when the sun was setting. The attendant at the cable car station packed us like sardines into the cable car when going up. It was uncomfortable during the short ride. Long queues also formed when coming down but the cable car station increased the frequency of the cable car to cope with the crowd.

It was very windy & cold when we were up there. it may look spectacular to some but as for us, having been to scenic lookouts in quite a few cities & countries, many of them which are free, this seems costly & not so convenient.","Written June 27, 2016"
Japan,Mt. Moiwa,Excellent night view.. cold too,"Although the cable car rides up were nothing to shout about (not cheap either), the night views were worthwhile.

Take the tramp car from Odori Park station (counter clockwise direction) and get off at Ropeway Iriguchci Station. There is a shuttle bus from this place to the ropeway station and refer my photos for time table and location. However, ropeway station is less than 1km by walk but good to use the free shuttle if you are lazy to walk on a hilly road. Round ticket is 1700 and must go to the upper most station because nothing to see in the middle station. Cable car service is available untile around 9 pm. The view is simply amazing.",

Japan,Mt. Moiwa,A must visit!!,"I visited 北海道神宮, Hokkaidō Jingū first and went back to Maruyamakoen Station to take bus 10 or 11 (210Yen) to Mt. Moiwa, around 15-20 mins bus ride. It doesn't stop directly in front of mt.moiwa, you have to walk up the hill for 5mins? If u don't know where to alight, u can approach the driver and ask him to inform you when you reach your destination or u can use google maps.
Or from Susukino, take Sapporo's only streetcar line to ""Ropeway Iriguchi"" station (25 minutes, 170 yen, frequent departures). From there, a free shuttle bus operates to the lower ropeway station (5 minutes, departs every 20 minutes).
Alternatively, the Mount Moiwa Ropeway can be reached in a five minute walk from the Ropeway Iriguchi streetcar stop.

From the Ropeway Mountain Base Station to the Mountainside Station in a cable car, takes roughly five minutes, plenty of time to take in the scenery all around you.
Once you arrive at the Mountainside Station, you can take a break at the gift shop and change here to the ""Morris Car,"" it carries passengers to the Summit Station in less than two minutes.
Once at the top, the Summit Station's rooftop observatory offers a 360-degree view, including the city of Sapporo and the aforementioned nearby mountains. There's also a French restaurant at the Summit Station and it allows every party to enjoy a window seat and the wonderful view of they city.

You can also write any commemoration message on the padlock and leave it on the third floor of the summit observatory. So bring one along with you or u can get one at the Star Hall!

We 4 adults had a great time going down the super slide in the playground area, We also enjoyed the bird area, the small but quality zoo, the rose garden which still had some roses in it even in late October, as well as other types of flowers, and of course, the immense fields of cosmos in bloom.

We went here for 3 hours in September. Took a ferry from Hakata port (a very nice 15 min ride, not too many waves and you get to see great distance view of hakata city) to Saitozaki ferry terminal.
This park is enormous, best way to see everything without taking forever is to hire a bike. It's around 500Yen for 3-4 hours. There are designated bike paths in the park, however you can take the bike in certain areas where there is lot of foot traffic. There are lot of bike stops where you can park and have a walk through different attractions. There is a bit of everything at this seaside park, there is a zoo, bird area, picnic areas, lot of gardens and is very kid friendly too - such as kids pools, picnic benches etc.
Great place to go to escape the city for a few hours, especially on a lovely sunny day, whether your a couple or a family, there's something to do for everyone. When we went, there wasn't too many flowers blooming. This place must be exploding with people during cherry blossom season....

Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Great family day out destination,"We spent the day out here and it was one of our best days of the trip. We hired bikes at the entrance near the station and rode right around the park. There was plenty of choice of bikes ranging from kids 18in right up to full adult sizes and most (if not all) had baskets to place a bag in on the front, there were even some tandem bikes. The grounds are lovely, beautiful floral areas, a lovely coastal road to ride along and some incredible playgrounds around the grounds. There is a small free zoo and also some paid activities like go karts and mini golf. There are drink vending machines scattered around the park so if you get thirsty out on your ride you don't have to head back to a restaurant/cafe to refresh. It's worth taking the time to head out here with your family, it's a wonderful day out.","Written December 2, 2018"
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Disappointing...there was no vast cosmos field. Nov 2018...,I used my unlimited bus/train/ JR one day pass to access Uminonakamichi PArk. I was there 915am. The park opened at 930am. I was travelling solo and was interested in the flower gardens. The park was so vast and I can't ride a bike so I started walking to the left side. I reached the rose garden but roses were not in bloom. There was a small group of pink cosmos. The rows of yellow ginko trees were amazing. Fountains and lots of areas for bike riders. I passed by a small zoo. Good educational fun for children. Lots of nice views but they were just too far apart if one is not on bike.There was a food area near the mini golf. I took an udon lunch there. There were lots of areas for famiy fun and activities. I left the PArk at 1pm.,"Written December 2, 2018"
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Must see for families!,"I loved every minute of this park!

When you arrive, there are many different gates or places to choose from to start your day. Each gate has a place to rent bicycles and they even have helmets for the little ones. We started at the West Gate which was opposite of where we were heading so we biked the entirety of the park. We rented bikes for my eight year old and myself (with a seat attached for my four year old). The trails for the biking were safe along with parking. Each bike came with a lock so that you can keep track of your rental and not worry about someone taking yours (which I don't believe would happen).

here is a small zoo inside. I would skip it if you are looking to feed the animals. All of them lie down the majority of the time and don't really interact with the crowd. Definitely visit the park areas. One has two bouncy clouds! Each one has different age groups but no adults are allowed to bounce. Loads of slides, sand/water to build sand castles and things to do to keep your little busy and have them burn energy. They did have go carts and a maze but those you had to pay extra to do. We may do them when we go back! We arrived around 12 p.m. and didn't depart until maybe 4 or 4:30 p.m. Definitely will return! Will also try to the aquarium!","Written November 9, 2018"

Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Great park ..one of the best in Japan,"This is a amazing park. We took JR to Kashi from Hakata Station.
From Kashi there is special train from platform 4 to park.

After getting down you can hit the park or aquarium. We decided to go to park first as marine world closes art 9:30.

You can buy ticket with and without swimming pool. If you change your mind after getting inside park you just need to pay the difference.

Balance bike and bike with peddles can be rented just near the main gate. Park is too big. There are buses but frequency is less. There are food options but quality is so so.

Swimming pool has different sections as per height. There are body guards in kid section. Its challenging to cover everything in one day as park is too big. So better decide what to visit as per age group.","Written August 7, 2018"
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Phenomenally fun and fantastic value for money,"If you are in Fukuoka with young children and its a beautiful sunny day - head here. If you have seen the other reviews, you will no doubt already know that this is a large park. But large is an understatement - it is absolutely sprawling.

First - the logistics. You can get here by stopping at either Uminonakamichi Station, or Saitozaki Station, which is approximately 45 - 50 minutes from Hakata Station.. Stop at Uminonakamichi if you want to hit the Whale Cloud / Go Karting / Slides area first. If you prefer to get closer to the Dolphin Playground and Animal area, stop at Saitozaki instead.

It is possible to rent bicycles or walk the park. We chose to walk as we had a pleasant summer day. While there is an internal shuttle bus, its not very frequent (we were there on a weekday and it was on an hourly basis).

You can check the website to see a picture of the map and you should do so if you have young kids in tow as this place is so large, that you cannot actually get from one attraction to another without quite a bit of walking / cycling. You will be able to see the list of attractions from the website but what is not obvious from the website is the incredible quality and high standards of maintenance this park has at every attraction. The Whale Cloud which is like a huge bouncy was an incredible amount of fun, the Go Kart (which is payable) is well worth the money and you can choose between a Bumpy Route and a Smooth Route - and you get on these motorised cars and drive them on a short, but fun route. The playground with long, fun slides were fantastic. The Waterside Playpark offers a more challenging play area for slightly older children with rope like challenges, the Sky Dolphin play area had more slides and rope play areas.

While the animal area is not large, it was very well maintained, and the animals well looked after. You get to feed the goats , sheep, ducks and swans (food can be purchased at 100 yen) and pet the Guinea Pigs. You can touch the rabbits and turtles as well. There were beautiful flamingoes, monkeys, capybara, peacocks, kangaroos, turtles, cranes, rabbits and many more animals.

On top of all the kid friendly exhibits and play areas, the grounds are expansive, beautiful, and even though we spent 5 hours in the park, we barely managed to cover a quarter of the park.

The one thing that you need to note when coming here, is that there is a lack of food. I am not sure if this is the case on weekends as there certainly were some food areas designated and there were food pictures on the website but they were not open while we were there. Drinks are available in the form of vending machines all over the park but food was not. There was a snack store at the animal area but only selling donuts and ice cream.

This was the kids best day in Fukuoka and their most memorable. It was an awesome day for the adults too. One of the best playground and park we have ever seen.","Written June 17, 2018"
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Lovely park for all the family,"A huge park, so cycling is the best way to go around. Easy to rent bicycles and enjoy the ride. Stop and park at designated bicycle areas. Park grounds are vast, with a beautiful garden of roses, and many areas and has something for everyone . Great place for a family outing. Journey out here is long but worth it if you have the time. We spent the morning here, and then walked to the Marine World for lunch.","Written June 14, 2018"
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,A Wonderful Place on a Nice Spring Day,"It is easy to catch a train to this park with only 1 change. I was at the start of April when all cherry trees were still in bloom. In addition, many displays of spring flowers were around. I didn't hire a bike, but just had a walk to see all flowers and also visited the small Zoo. The day was sunny, the views are very colourful, but for sure, it is probably a better place for families with kids.I also think that it is great to visit during this time of the year, but will be just grass at some other times. I spent about 4 hrs there and pretty much covered all I wanted to see. While monkeys and flamingos were nice to see in the Zoo, the area for grey kangaroos is too small and they definitely do not have much room to enjoy their life there and were just lying.This was sad, as we used to see these animals roaming free in Australia.","Written June 1, 2018"
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Great Park,"Little far out there but worth the time and effort to get out there to spend a sunny afternoon. Yes, like other reviewers have said, this place is huge. Don't worry, you can rent bicycles to get yourself around on the pathway at a reasonable price.
There is an animal zoo, flower garden, jungle gym for children, water pool play area and probably lots other stuff that we didn't have the chance to see or do.
If you bring food, just remember to stow it away or keep it with you when you park your bike. There are birds that will devour it before you return.","Written May 23, 2018"

The free zoo was great! You can buy food to feed some of the animals, though be mindful of the signs as they will tell you which animals shouldn't be fed (e.g. the monkeys and the donkeys should not be fed).
We hired a bicycle for the day, which was great fun. I think it was about 400 Yen? You can switch bicycles throughout the day so we switched to a tandem bike for some random fun towards the end of the day.","Written December 7, 2017"

Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Had a blast and should have spent 2 days at least,"We are a family of 4 with 2 young kids (5 & 7). We arrived at around 11am. First rented each of us a bicycle to get around this huge park. They are all sorts of bicycles for all ages (some with supporting wheels, or baby seat). You'll surely find one suitable. Bicycles are basically must-have in this park as it is too big for walking from one place to another. We visite the Forest House which allows to do free wooden crafts. They provided you with all the tools you need. And it is air-conditioned, very important in hot summer. Afterwards, we spend 2 hours at the Sunshine pool which is only open during summer. The kids had a blast and would not want to leave. We didn't managed to visit other parts of the park. Too bad it is closes early.

The Sunshine pool has all necessary facilities like lockers, changing room, shower and many eateries. Be sure to bring a small water proof bag to hold money.",
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Nice Big Park with various Activities,"I would have given it ""Good"", but TripAdvisor goes from ""Average"" straight to ""Very Good"".

We took the ferry to come here. When you arrive, you can rent bicycles in the same building where you can buy your return ticket for the ferry but here you can rent only until 3 pm. Wait until you reach the park (if you were going there) and you can rent bikes until 6 pm.

The park is quite big, so bicycles are quite useful to move around.

In the park, you can find a kind of mini-zoo with different species of monkeys, some kangaroos, some wallabies, and many other kinds of anymals.

There is a playground for kids. There is a kind of small amusemment park, or it may be more accurate to say that there are a few rides.

You can buy food and drinks at a few places; they have vending machines for drinks and there are toilets, which are free. Food and drinks are a bit expensive, so you might want to bring something to drink before leaving town.

Initially, we wanted to visit around the park after visiting there, but we got surprised by the rain, so we took a ferry back earlier than intended.","Written August 15, 2017"

We arrived around 2pm and the park closed at 5pm. So it was a bit short of time. We rented the bike for 3 hours at 400 yen. Our kid can sit in the front. It was really nice weather. Sunny with breeze.

At the park, they have play structures suitable for many ages and an eating area where you can grab some quick dishes (pork-broth ramen and similar things). Bring lots of cash in the form of coins and 1000 yen notes – you buy food and tickets from machines. Pools open in July, but there is a wading pool. The animal area is great, the kids loved walking inside the kangaroo and capybara enclosures, getting close-up experiences. The flowers are plentiful and lovely. I only wish we would could have had more time, as we were rushing through the park a bit during the 4 hours we were there. Plan for a whole day outing and bring snacks, plenty of water, swimwear and towels during the warm months!

The park offers guide maps in many languages including English and the staff spoke English enough for me to understand where bike rental was and how to return it. Everyone I encountered was very kind.

It took us a while to find the West Gate, which is the main entrance to this massive park. I reckon it could rival the size of London's Hyde Park!

My daughter wanted to hit the Sky Dolphin first, and this is by far the best playground I've been to. It's ultra clean and superbly fun. The slide isn't just a sheet of metal but a layer of tiny rollers to whizz you down the three storey structure.

While the kids were at the playground for an hour and half, my father went off to the chip and putt area, which cost him only a meager ¥400 for the 18 hole ""course"".

We then headed to the zoo area which seriously impressed us. There were a whole bunch of animals but they weren't kept in miserable cages. Rather they roamed freely in enclosures where children could interact with the animals. The impressive thing about the Japanese is the incredible sense of hygiene and cleanliness. Every enclosure had hand sanitizers for kids to use after they have handled the animals, and sinks to thoroughly wash down hands with infant safe soap.

We spent the whole day there yesterday and even skipped lunch and we still couldn't get enough. We are headed back tomorrow again cos we just can't get enough.

Just a tip - the F&B in this park isn't very comprehensive so pack a picnic lunch if you intend to head there for the day.",

We saw it briefly on trip advisor, but wehn we saw how far away it was from Hakata (where we were staying) we almost didn't bother. Glad we did! The trains were a bit hard to figure out, as they were on the JR line, rather than standard, and the switch for trains in Kashii was pretty confusing -regional lines seem to presume you know what you're doing- basically you head from Kashii to Umi No Nakamichi and it's the second last stop. Don't fret if you go to far, it's a 10 minutes wait and the train reverses. However we had to switch trains the stop before Umi no Nakamichi - not sure why, but the captain wandered through, spotted us and directed us to opposite side :)

We clearly went in off peak, but had a blast. Hire a bike definitely but don't leave any food in your baskets when you get to each stop - it will be taken by the birds - there's warning signs everywhere.

We hired a 2 person bike and you just follow the blue lines - there's maps everywhere with where to go and what to stop at. We spent about 3 hours there, and missed most of the sights as we spent the majority of the time enjoying the ride and playing at the forest park - which is essentially a massive petting zoo. Keep in mind we are 2x 30 something year olds, but it was great. The area was massive, the creatures were clean and there were things there I'd never heard of. There are hand washing stations anywhere, so don't pat anything unless you have thoroughly washed. And there are also some cool vending machines that give you these odd biscuit things that snap onhalf and are full of food pellets. The animals know that sound of the machine and head straight to you. From inside their respective areas, the animals are mainly free to roam, so many will mooch right on up to you for a pat.

It looked like there were also water rides and rose gardens etc etc, which we didn't get around to, and didn't really try because we went coming into December and figured it would be a touch cold to bother.

If you have kids, make a day of it. If you don't, enjoy the ride and stop wherever you want. We had a blast here! (there's also a marine park across the road from this where most people who got off at the trainstop went.)",
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,A whole day's worth of fun in this wonderful park,"Using our JR Rail passes we decided ro make a day trip from Osaka to Fukuoka with our 3 children aged 6, 8 and 10. On the train we came across this park while searching for things to do. What a brilliant find! The train from Shin-Hakata was convenient and had some lovely seaside views. Once at the park we put our bags in a locker and hired bikes to get around. They were super cheap to hire and very comfortable. We visited the amusement park, which our children loved! So many things to do there and a food hall too. We then biked to the zoo, which had some interesting animals. The children had pony ride and loved cuddling the guinea pigs. We then took in the views of the ocean and golden sand beaches and made it back just in time to return our bikes. While we waited for our train arrived the children were able to walk a goat. They lady looking after it was very friendly and very kind to our children. We had a blast!! We would love to have been there in summer when the water park was open, but there was still plenty to see and do even in Autumn.","Written November 15, 2015"
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Wonderful and great park for kids and family,"When we arrived, we didn't realized that it is such a big park, we do not have enough time spending there, so we decided to skip the Zoo. Just walk around and play with the kids in the park would be great. Hubby and my son went to visit the Japanese car museum, although a bit small, but they said it worth a visit. The long donuts bought in the park is yummy even we had breakfast before coming.
The gardening there is nice, all the plants, lake are beautiful. The kids playground is superb (that was amazing and we had a great time there). We must pay a visit again when we go to Fukuoka next time.",

Overall, nice place to spend a relaxing day...

Big hint... Bring your own food for a picnic lunch... did not see any place that sells food. Best to pick up a bento box when at the Hakata train station.","Written November 5, 2015"

Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Excellent park and happy memories,"My young son and husband didn't expect this park would be so fun and enjoyable. It is a very large park and we did everything from feeding fish, jumping on big white trampoline type hills, roller type slides, difficult obstacle courses, swimming at the water park (except we found the water to be too cold), and the highlight of the visit was cycling as a family in safe bicycle routes. Everything was ready and accessible, my husband and I first rode on a two seater and then switched to a single riders with little station stops a long the way. We found this to be very fun and easy to ride since it is difficult for us to do this in Hong Kong.",
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Expansive Nature-Themed Park,"We took the Uminaka Ferry line to this expansive nature-themed park in Shikanoshima Island. Inside, suggest getting around it via bicycle rentals or moving trains (our choice). There are flower gardens, an amusement park, playgrounds, zoo, and vast grassy areas. We first went to the Animal Forest, where we saw capybaras, flamingos, small horses, kangaroos, llamas, various types of monkeys, peacocks (2 of them in different cages spread their colorful tails for us), prairie dogs, and other animals. The children petted guinea pigs and sheep. We next took the train to Wonder World, where we all rode go-karts on 2 separate tracks: flat and rough/unpaved. It was fun! The children then went on the giant Octopus slides, followed by the Whale Cloud “Fluff-Poline” (many connected trampolines), jumping up and down until park closing. We walked past a cherry-blossom-lined street towards the exit and took the JR line to Hakata Station, changing trains at Kashii Station. A truly wonderful and relaxing day at a nature park!","Written August 11, 2015"

Maybe a bit far out from the city but for the kids, this is Fukuoka attraction no 1 having spent 10 days in fukuoka. Entrance fee is insignificant but the following attractions are mind boggling; 1. 3 of the longest downhill slides i hv ever seen, more than 50m downhill. 2. The waterpark is fantastic with aka ninja warrior obstacles for the kids built over a meandering stream. Sense of challenge, motor abilities and achievement 3. The go kart was a wild ride gteed to bring glee to many kids faces... 4. The giant bouncing castle at the entrance... This underrated and seldom publicised giant park exceeded our expectatiobs. We came here as a side trip after the Marine Park but spent many hours here till it closed at 5pm.   And my kids insisted on comg here again...on its own.","Written December 1, 2013"

In short, I strongly suggest anyone to visit this wonderful park!",
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Fabulous flowers!,"My son lives in Fukuoka and we have visited Uminonakamichi Park several times, normally for the grandchildren to play. Each time I have visited, there is something new to look at; this April we saw the dolphin cloud ( a huge bouncy undulating area for the children to run, bounce and roll on) and while the children found the many play areas, my partner & I strolled around the flower garden. Wow! I had never been to this area before and was really impressed by the huge displays. We returned to the Park once more prior to leaving Japan and this time went to the animal area where again we were impressed at the space, cleanliness and care. The children were able to have hands-on experiences with the smaller creatures and thoroughly enjoyed their time. We did take picnics on each occasion, knowing there were plenty of seats and quiet areas to enjoy our food. Altogether two more great experiences during our time in Japan.",
Japan,Uminonakamichi Seaside Park,Normal park,"I visited Umi no nakamichi seaside park during Dec 2012. It was my first destination once my family and I reached Fukuoka.

Unfortunately, it was raining on the day i visited and the wind was extremely strong. Thus, we were not able to enjoy the park properly.

The park was very huge, however, there was not much things to see and do. Many of the attractions such as the go-cart were not open. Even the 'food court' does not seem to be open even thought it is already noon when I visited the place.

We finally found the ferris wheel after a long walk, however, the price seemed a little towards the high side and therefore we felt it wasn't worth the price. We did bought some food to feed the fish which we thought was quite fun!

It would be better to enjoy the park when the weather is not freezing cold!","Written January 4, 2013"

We took the train out to Uminonakamichi, and then bought a ticket on the little toy train that goes round the park. All of us - especially our 4 year old - had a great time, playing on the slides, jumping around on the inflatable mountains, looking at the boats out on the sea, and just generally walking around a spacious, green, quiet park. The zoo is a bit sad, but apart from that it was a really good day out.","Written February 20, 2012"

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Serenity in Yokohama,"A beautiful and peaceful garden just south of Yokohama. A little bit off the beaten track, so not as busy as other attractions, but it's well worth a visit. Easy walks around the lake, with magnificent views of the villas and pagoda.","Written March 8, 2020"
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Don’t go during winter season,"Our cruise was cancelled due to Convid-19 . Trying to fill our time, we decided to venture this garden. Because of the season, there was hardly anything to see. I went up to the pagoda area (pagoda itself was closed) to get a glimpse of the garden from above. Quite barren, but I’m sure it would have been a pretty sight to see in spring, summer and fall.
There was a house that one can enter (shoes off) and see how people live before. It was quite interesting.
Took a bus from Chinatown area and walked probably 15 minutes to the garden . Bus was a flat 220 yen , entrance fee to garden was 700 yen.","Written February 19, 2020"
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,always fun things here,we were lucky and saw a guitar concert live in one of the temples on the garden grounds...it's such a beautiful place and slightly off the beaten path in Yokohama. I imagine the fall foliage is also so pretty.,"Written February 9, 2020"
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,A garden break from the big city,"Tokyo certainly offers its share of beautiful gardens. Tourists know that. And Tokyo hosts a lot of tourists. The goal of serenity that underpins Japanese garden style can be achieved among a crush of visitors, possibly, if you close your eyes and play flute music through your earbuds.

Or you can take a short rail trip south of Tokyo to Yokohama. Not exactly a suburb, but almost. A half-hour train ride from Shinjuku station and you’ve escaped to the largest industrial port in Japan. Not serene. But you won’t be stopping at the port. You’ll be seeking out Sankeien Garden.

Yokohama also features the country’s greatest Chinatown, and you may want to have lunch there before catching the No. 8 or No. 148 bus to the garden $7/adult). Sankeien is so called because it was built by Hara Sankei, a rich silk merchant, and opened to the public in 1904. To add authentic touches Sankei-san pulled in vintage structures from elsewhere, such as the dominating pagoda, dating from the 1400s. Experience a tea ceremony, tour a gassho style (heavily thatched) house from Hida prefecture, or climb the hill to the pagoda. The garden brings together a little of traditional culture from around the Kanto region, a good introduction if you have no time to go very far beyond Tokyo.

Because, presumably, getting to Sankeien is slightly challenging, it seems to remain more tranquil than the more famous Tokyo gardens. We stopped by in January, perhaps not everyone’s top month for garden visits, but it was only a bit chilly, the pine is always green, something is always blooming, and the waterfowl still frolic.

Sankeien Garden is also a little melancholy. Its scars and ruins over a century call to mind the sad tragedy of Japan through war and natural catastrophe. Structures in the garden are gone or lie in ruins, victims of the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 or, more poignantly, allied bombing during World War II. This faint reminder of Japan’s heritage, a small island nation prone to earthquakes, tsunamis, and military dictatorships, perhaps can be sensed within the soft breeze through the pines and winter-blooming camellia. We can take time to pause and reflect. No earbuds necessary.",

The garden was landscaped in the usual japanese style and along the years, Sankeien purchased, made dismantled and rebuild a number of religious buildings or tea houses from al over Japan, thus enriching the place until making it today one of the not to be missed spots in Yokohama.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,A garden one must visit -serene and beautiful,"Reaching the garden : On reaching Sakuragicho ( JR line ) station , went to bus stand no : 2 and could choose either bus route no: 8 or 148 . Bus fare JPY 220 ( one way ) and a 20~ 30 mins ride ( depending on traffic ) you reach the last bus stop from where the garden entrance is a 5 ~7 mins walk .
The garden : After purchasing a ticket ( JPY 700 /adult ) at the counter , the ticket is scanned at the entrance and then one can choose to either take a leisurely walk around the garden or go along with an English speaking guide ( free of charge ) .
The landscaping of the garden with a big lake in the middle is mesmerizing. Since I visited during summer time , the garden was filled with lush green trees and small bridges leading to a few Japanese style houses which adds to the beauty of the place. After a walk , just relaxing by the lake (which has ducks and plenty of fishes), - the tranquility will refresh you immediately .

I went to the gardens with my almost 84-year-old stepmother. By the time we had walked up the hill to the gardens, she was exhausted. It was terrific to find free wheelchairs available at the entrance. It has gravel paths, which aren't the most conducive for wheelchairs, but the wheelchair was very helpful. The gardens were beautiful even if most of the plants weren't in bloom. We especially loved our tour of the farmer's house. It would have been great just to wander through on our own, but one of the men inside offered to show us around as a way to practice his English and to help us learn more.

Once you get there and get inside the gate there is an impressive span or garden with a 3-story Pagoda overlooking everything. It was peaceful and quiet. Children were running and laughing. It was nice. Depending on the time of year you can see different varieties of trees and plants flowering. For us it was blue and pink hydrangeas. The architecture was beautiful. Some very old buildings from 1600s and some from Edo period. I really enjoyed the house that you could walk in and see how a family lived a century ago. A docent gave us a great walking tour of the house. It took us about 2.5 h to see everything but we could have stayed longer had the weather permitted.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Beautiful and peaceful place,"We had a lovely time strolling through the gardens, admiring the trees and flowers, and learning the history of this home.
We loved seeing the ladies in their kimonos having pictures made, and then we climbed up the hill to see the 3 tiered pagoda. All wonderful! The climb was short, but steep for a person with disabilities- but it was a beautiful sight! Definitely worth the bus ride if you are staying in Yokohama, and the entrance fee was about ¥700 per person.",
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Tip for a nice day out in the Yokohama area,"Beautiful park outside Yokohama. You do need to take the bus (number 8) to get to the park, or take a taxi. There are no train or subway stations nearby. The park shows some old japanese buildings and a three story pagoda moved here from Kyoto. The walkways are all gravel so good shoes are to recommend.
There are some ponds and small lakes ans well as some small brooks. Very nice on good days. Dont forget to bring a picknick basket.","Written March 31, 2019"

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Very Nice Way to Spend a Few Hours On A DIY,"We decided to revisit the Sankien Gardens plan on Tuesday morning since we missed them on Sunday. The gardens don’t open until 0900 and five of us (Pam, Sue, Judy, CL and myself) jumped in one of those great Toyota Alfard taxis right from Osanbashi Terminal. About 2500 YEN later, yes, 2500 YEN for the 5 of us. We were at Sankien Gardens. (Note that the Princess 2 hour tour was $70 per person.) The taxi was not $100 as told by the destination lecturer.

700YEN per person entry fee into the gardens was a bargain. We spent 3 hours wandering the gardens and the exhibits having CL translate the Kanji for us just for fun – almost everything had English translations as well, but having him translate the characters directly was pretty cool. The gardens were not crowded at all, but did have several wedding picture parties. The formal wedding kimonos were incredibly colorful, detailed and beautiful. The brides radiant and beautiful. The koi in the pond were a lot of fun to feed and watch. All of us were cheering on the turtles trying to get a piece of bread before the swarming koi got it. Unfortunately they were not successful. The koi invariably got all the bread.

Incredible pictures of an egret stalking and spearing an insect. Japanese and Chinese gardens, as explained by CL, are not botanical gardens exhibiting flowering plants. Rather they are islands of peace and serenity with everything strategically and deliberately placed to promote a unique view from every perspective. This was a private garden at one time and I can see how this would have been a unique and beautiful oasis for the family back in the day. There are refreshments (including beer) and toilets with the incredibly technologically advanced, AND CLEAN, stalls – including the electronic running water sound to encourage one to get the job done. All in all, a great and inexpensive way to spend a couple of hours in Yokohama.","Written November 24, 2018"
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Most Buildings are reserved for private ceremony,I went in October before cruise started in Yokohama. I was quite disappointed about most of the building are closed for only private use. The garden is well maintained but may be due to season there was no flowers at all. I trust there are quite a lot of history to see if those buildings are open for public. Wish the garden can publish what buildings to open in their website to let visitors to decide if they should go.,

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Go for a 1 hour free English guided tour! Very informative.,The garden is extremely beautiful in itself but we were lucky to encounter the free English guided tour (there was an announcement about the tour or ask the staff at the main entrance about the free guided tour.) The tour guide was very informative and provided us with insight why the garden was constructed and the Zen- Shinto infused landscape. He even imitated the process of the famous tea ceremony at the actual building where the owner of the compound did the ceremony 100 years ago. A free guided tour is well worth it. Go for it when there’s chance!!!,

A number of historic buildings from around Japan have been dismantled, transported to Sankeien Garden and rebuilt with exquisite attention to detail, so you would not be blamed for thinking you are in some other town and not Yokohama.

Were they happy? They had beautiful creations! Was it enough? Then you come back to the present and wonder about yourself; will you like to build something like this?
The man who first build this garden for himself was he thinking one day he will leave such a beautiful legacy?",
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Bucket List! This is a beautiful garden with something for everyone!,"This is by far the best garden we visited on the entire trip. Because of our love of oriental gardening, it has been on our Bucket List for years. It was great to see one that was so well designed, planned, populated, and maintained. It has wonderful plants, water features, historic architecture, beautiful vistas, changes in topography, viewing platforms, and serenity. It was a pleasure to spend a few hours here--there are photo opportunities at every turn and stop. I have included a few of my favorites.

Just as an aside, all ""true"" Japanese Gardens do not feature a lot of blooming plants. If you are looking a masses of color and annual plantings, do not make this trip! The beauty of the garden is the simplicity and the structure. There is a real elegance to it, but it is hard for many Americans to deal with it when compared to Western Gardens. You really have to find pleasure in the tree selection and training--the shapes are magnificent. The ponds tend to be very still (there are a few waterfalls and running ""rivers"" for you to enjoy for the sound, but not many). Just go in there prepared to relax and enjoy the natural beauty that has taken years to create!

There is an optional Tea Ceremony in one of the many buildings on the property. It is a very nice one that you should consider. There is also a decent gift shop at the entrance to the ceremony room.

The garden is very popular for wedding photos! There are a number of you g people in native dress having their pictures taken. It is really a beautiful sight--lots of color. For those of you wanting colorful plantings, this will more than make up for the lack of it in the garden!

It is important to point out that there is a lot of walking to be done here! We saw no one in the garden with walking aids of any kid. The main paths are smooth, but all the interesting side paths will be challenging to anyone with mobility problems.

Even if you are not an avid gardener, you should consider this if you have the time. We took the bus from the closest stop to the cruise terminal. The bus system (like so many things in Japan) is more than a bit confusing, but you can muscle through it. On the way back, you can stop at the Chinatown--which will bring you back to earth quickly!

The gardens (as well as the bus) will require Yen--no credit cards are accepted!",

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Beautiful even if no flowers are blooming,"Such a peaceful place to spend a couple hours, even if nothing is blooming (just a few hydrangeas and a lone day lily). It is not hard to get here: if you take the Nissan Gallery skywalk to Yokohama Station, you'll end up right at the YCAT bus terminal. Look for ""A Bus Line"" (red sign) and go to platform 2 and get in line. Wait for Bus 8 or 148 and have exact change ready (220 yen at this writing). Drop your coins in the box as you enter the front, and take a seat. The digital sign above the drive displays the next stop in English as well as Japanese, so when you see Sankei-en-Iriguchi stop about 35 minutes later, press the red button at your seat to indicate you intend to get off.

From where you are dropped, head toward the Claire bakery (stop in for a sweet treat-the pastries and cookies are good!), and then follow the signs 300m to the entrance. Lots of nice photo-worthy spots (again, nothing was blooming when I visited). Clean bathrooms inside and outside the entrance next to the parking lot. I spent about 60 minutes or so wandering around and enjoyed the serenity.

To return, just go back to the same bus stop and take the #8 or 148 bus back (again have exact coin change fare ready). You can get off anywhere along the line, so if you want to explore Chinatown, Motomachi or the Yamate Park western-style homes on the bluff, disembark before the Motomachi-Chukagai stop.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,One of My Favorite Places on Earth,"Nestled away in Yokohama this little garden is a gem. The garden is beautiful and well kept, very aesthetically pleasing. It also has little historic temples and old houses which are interesting in themselves. There is one multi-storey house you can walk around, complete with a fire in the open range kitchen, which is an interesting view into life into old Japan.

The tea ceremony was quite fun, with very friendly ladies explaining to us how we should do it and not being too distraught as we got it all wrong!

If doing a day trip to Yokohama it makes a good first stop. To get there we got the Tokyu line (catch it from Shibuya) and if you get the right train you can stay on it as it turns into Minatomirai line, then get off at the last stop, Motomachi-Chukagai. If you exit there (I want to say exit no.2 but don't quote me on that) you can cross the road to the bus stop - you can either hop on the bus no.8 which I understand stops nearby the garden (although we did not do this), or if you time it right there was an hourly bus that services the gardens and goes straight there. When heading back take the bus that goes every hour and get off near China town, just in time for lunch - perfect!","Written June 18, 2018"

We did manage to find one lovely tree in its last days so had to content ourselves with that.
The Gardens are beautifully laid out and like most tourist destinations in Japan, seniors do get a discount. Typical of the friendliness of the Japanese, we were greeted by a volunteer guide with quite good English who was only too happy to take us on a guided tour of the area, pointing out plants, etc and showing us through the amazing Samuri building which is some 700 years old.

On the day of our visit, luckily, there was an older gentleman who spoke English and offered to tour us around the house (for free!). It was amazingly preserved and impressively kept in good order. Definitely worth a visit. Also, don't forget to try the Shinagawa Soba Sampler in the restaurant closest to the entrance. I couldn't remember the name as it was in Japanese, like most establishments.

But the highlight for me is the Japanese tea ceremony in the memorial hall. For 500 yen, we were able to experience a tea ceremony with macha and sweets, and as a bonus they also thought us how to make traditional tea! It's the best 500 yen we've ever spent.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,A zen moment,"I went to this garden which was about a 35 minute bus ride + 5 minute walk from our hotel in MinatoMirai. I needed to find the soul of Yokohama and I think I found it here.
September was not a good time for viewing blossoms, it is probably enchanting in the spring when the cherry trees and wisterias are in bloom or in the fall when the maple trees turn from red to gold. But still I was not disappointed when I visited in September.
In this garden, you will find your zen moment if you wanted to, in the reflective pool with Koi swimming to the surface, the sighting of a heron perched on one foot or a wooden boat with ducks drying their wings.
Or have a tea ceremony with Japanese women who explain to you their art.
Or to watch a black butterfly move from one red lily to another in a dance.
Or witness a Japanese couple shyly walking together for photos of their wedding mementos.
But if none of these touch you, then go for the architecture- the pagodas and restored homes of an earlier period reflect the culture that is sorely lacking in metropolitan Yokohama.

The first thing you notice is a huge lake along one side is a forest walk and on the other lots of lotus flowers. They were all out in bloom the morning we were there, even our guide had never seen them this way before.
There were several temples within this large Japanese Garden, some of which had been relocated from elsewhere.
There was a tea room in the centre where we took a traditional tea ceremony for a little extra cost.
We spent two hours just walking round and admiring the gardens. There were volunteers on hand to provide history and guidance if required.",

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Beautiful Japanese gardens worth a visit,"I was staying in Yokohama and visited these gardens on a spur of the moment thing and I'm so happy I did! With a beautiful large lake, little bridges, mini waterfalls and Japanese building and view point this was a lovely afternoon. It was so peaceful and I took so many photos as it was stunning. If you want to escape the city and see more traditional Japanese gardens these are definately the best ones, even some of the more popular gardens in Tokyo did not compare to this place.
I found it very easy to get to, taking the 101 bus from Yokohama to Honmoku and then a short 3-5min walk to the entrance.",
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Large and Beautiful Garden,"After staying in Tokyo coming to this place was a surprise because of its huge size. The garden was bigger than I expected and could take hours trying to cover the entire grounds.

When my family went, there was a pictorial going on for a wedding couple. There were many backdrops for them to chose from.

Some of the sights we visited:

The carp lake
The ruins of a guest house for a monk
The observatory on top of the hill, overlooking the Yokohama Bay
An old Japanese house of a village chief
A small cottage
a small area used to serve sweets in the past
Tiny waterfall
Numerous small shrines
Pagoda

The grounds we covered only made up 60-70% of the entire estate. We had to end the trip early because of the July heat.","Written March 21, 2016"
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,A nice gentlemen docent.......,"I'm in Japan, from California, and my son wants to take me around Yokohama to see the sights. We went to the gardens one morning. It was interesting to see the different buildings that had been moved to the gardens. We took a nice long walk around the lake, which is the center point. Got a guide, printed in English, which helped, along with signs, explain what everything was. For me, the highlight was a docent, who took us through a farm house, built during the Edo Era, moved to the park in 1960. He explained everything, in Japanese, to my son, who relaid it to me. The docent seemed very pleased to show off his building, probably taking us into areas that were off limits to most. I hope I came away with a little more understanding of the culture and life in early 19th century, agricultural Japan.","Written March 17, 2016"
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Beauty and calm,"Getting there is a bit of a pain by public transport, simple enough, just slightly painful.
Train, then bus, then walk.

The walk makes up for the previous two. As I casually strolled to the gardens I had time to appreciate suburban Japan, with the streets in perfect conditions and everyone seeming to try and outdo each other with backyard semi-bonsai trees. Very relaxed when I got there.

Not very expensive, about 1000 Yen, I think (or less). And free to wander as much as I chose once inside the gate.

Come at the right time (late March/early April, I was told) and the plum blossoms are spectacular. Confirm this because they truly are captivating.

All the buildings and grounds are kept immaculate. I saw a couple of others taking photos there and most everyone was considerate of each other, standing out of the way and so on. A rare treat for sure.

Everywhere I went I was held in thrall by the magic of the place, walking around in this grandiose feeling almost palatial garden compound.

A guide I read suggested an hour and a half here as maximum time, I would suggest another hour on that if you truly want to relax and wander through slowly, appreciate the feeling and splendour that is here.

I left feeling zen and completely at ease. Seeing all the cats wandering around didn't hurt either. All very relaxed and comfortable with strangers everywhere.

Enjoy the views, breathe the air, have a cup of tea at the teahouse.",

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Still beautiful even in snowless winter,"You need to buy the entry ticket at one of the machines nearby. It's a hassle given the all-Japanese characters on the machine, but the parking attendant was glad to help.
It's still beautiful even with many leaf-less trees, you can imagine the beauty in a glorious spring. There are many spots that's suitable for great photos, some with the three-storied pagoda as part of the background. Climbing up the hill to the pagoda was a different story; it looked steep and the pagoda itself was not that stunning, so I decided to pass the opportunity.
If you look at individual items (like the pagoda I mentioned above), Sankeien garden was not particularly interesting; they look old, even a bit ugly.However, as a whole, the garden was exquisite.
There were some temporary tents that were probably used to sell things in the garden (the tents were empty when I was there, perhaps because it's late in the afternoon). Those tents were an eyesore, quite unfortunate for such a beautiful garden.",

They took us up hills, down to the lake, along small rivers and over the bridges! This place has rich history of both human and natures that will fascinatingly inspire you. Not to miss taking lots photos of beautiful gardens, amazing heritage buildings and the over 100 years old tree!

Wearing good pair of walking shoes is a must to truly enjoy this garden! For totally comfort you may also need to apply some mosquito repellants for the late afternoon tour, we didn't have any and had to suffer with some bites!

We took the same bus back to Yokohama station, but before that we got off at the 'revival' Yokohama China town for some Chinese food/snacks tasting adventures which included the Yokohama Number One dumplings and the Giant Chinese bun! There are plenty of nice restaurants, that you may want to try and enjoy your night here.",

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,An oasis in the city,"Providing a soothing contrast to Yokohama's futuristic Minato Mirai cityscape, Sankeien delights the eye with a rich display of natural beauty. Especially striking in the fall, Sankeien opens selected evenings for harvest moon viewing-- and sometimes sponsors delightful open air concerts. However, Sankeien's beautiful gardens and historic buildings (some of which are designated national treasures) are beautiful throughout the year, with each season bringing its own special natural treats. Be sure wear your walking shoes and to bring a camera as the various settings provide multiple photo opportunities. Plan to spend at least a couple of hours if you plan to cover most of the garden. In the tranquil environment, it is not unusual to see kimono-clad couples posing for wedding pictures. Traditional snacks or refreshments are available at a several locations. In a shop adjacent to the on-site museum which highlights the history of the garden's founder, an early silk merchant and an important patron of traditional arts, kimono-clad women serve green tea prepared in the traditional style. While the garden is a little out of the way (it is accessible by bus from central Yokohama), it is a great way to escape the concrete of the city and enjoy the feel of an older and more aesthetic Japan. If you don't have the time to visit Kyoto or Nara and still want to enjoy the charm of a traditional garden and setting, Sankeien is a great choice.",

The walk from the bus stop to the entrance was very inviting with the trees in full bloom showing us the way to the gardens. It was a lovely brisk day and there were plenty of people heading towards the entrance. We had bought some sushi at the railway station before we left so we could experience a real Hanami outing. We walked all around the gardens and even climbed up to the Pagoda and the lookout. The gardens were very beautiful with all the cherry blossoms out in bloom. There are a few eating places selling great looking foods in case you dont bring your own and you can sit at the outside tables and chairs that they supply admiring the scenery at the same time. There were a lot of brides having photos taken in this beautiful setting, so if you happen to visit when the cherry blossoms are in bloom you will be amazed at the beautiful dresses these ladies are wearing. It is a great time to visit. Also just outside the entrance there is a small stall selling local foods and we just had to try their own homemade cherry blossom icecream even though it was quite a cool day. The owner is very happy to have you sit while you are eating and even gave us a warm drink after. He would not take any money for the drink.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,IT IS A MUST,We were in Yokohama for a Congress and the Tourism Office of Yokohama highly recommended us to visit this Japanese typical park. We did it and we were not disappointed at all. This is something like doing a visit of Japan and having the opportunity to see in the same time the old and the new Japan. The parks contain 14 different areas (themes). this is easy to make the visit. The prize entrance is cheap. And the park is well served by public transportation. The park is totaly wheelchair accessible. We highly recommend the visit of the park to all visitors of the city of Yokohama. It is a must.,"Written June 3, 2015"
Japan,Sankeien Gardens,"This is not a Garden, but a Collection of Buildings from Various Eras","This large facility is less of a garden and more of a collection of buildings from various periods in Japanese history. A wealthy businessman purchased these buildings form various parts of Japan and had them erected at this site outside of Yokohama. In addition, he built a residence for himself in 1920. Later a modern building was constructed to house some pieces of art and to display a tribute to the wealthy silk merchant, Sankei Hara. Not shying from immodesty, he called this facility ""Sankei-en"" (meaning Sankei's garden), later passing away in 1939.

You can go into one of the Edo period buildings (the old Yonohara house moved to Sankei-en from Gifu Prefecture), a wealthy farmer's house, and see artifacts from that period. This is very interesting. Unfortunately, none of the other buildings are accessible, and can only be seen from a distance. There is an observatory (viewing platform) up on a hill in the very back of the garden, but the sweeping view is made up of oil refineries, tank farms, industrial installations, and a massive freeway. You must watch your step because the paths and stairways are not in good repair. Also up on the hill is a three tiered pagoda from the Muromachi period (what does this have to do with the garden?).

There were various shrines scattered around the facility, but they didn't make much sense and did not add to the beauty of the place. On the other hand, there was an attractive wisteria arbor and many nicely constructed period bridges.

I feel uncomfortable calling this facility a ""garden"", because that would insult the many beautiful gardens throughout Japan. It wasn't until long after Sankei Hara died that any pines were added, and to this day there are virtually no stones (the most important feature of any Japanese garden) on display. The quality of the gardening and pruning is either absent or clunky. Much was overgrown, and there were weeds everywhere. The pruning of the pines was mediocre, and what they do to the plum trees is just plain weird. The ponds are murky, stagnant water. Overall, the facility is unattractive.

In the modern building (offices and art displays), ladies in kimonos were inviting visitors to partake of the tea ceremony, which was a nice experience. There is a small restaurant in the back where we enjoyed beer, tempura, and green tea ice cream.

In summary, if you are interested architecture you should visit Sankei-en. If you are interested in Japanese gardens, you need not bother coming here. From Shibui and wabi-sabi, not a trace. This is a shocking story of a rich man's search for his cultural roots that somehow become lost in the rise and clamber of the middle class during the Edo period. Sadly, he failed.",

My only disappointment is that the grounds and around the pagodas are not well groomed or maintained. I asked my guide and she explained that the gardens do not raise much money to maintain and a lot of the upkeep is volunteer. I think more people should visit the grounds and help contribute.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,My most favourite garden in Japan,"I absolutely loved the Sankei-en garden. I went on one beautiful Monday morning in May, paid 500 yen and was mesmerised... There was hardly anyone there. It was so peaceful with no crowds. The garden is very large with lots of old houses that were transferred here from Kyoto and Kamakura. But everything feels so natural as if the houses have been here ever since. There was not many flowers in bloom but it was amazing to just walk around, take pictures and listen to the sound of water and heaps of bird noises. There were lots of signs in English, so you could learn more about the houses and history of the park.
The former Yonoharake house is open to the public, so you can wander through and see how people lived some years ago. It has a very wide collection historical objects and to me it felt even more authentic than the houses in Shirakawa-go! There are also super nice and knowledgeable volunteers that are always happy to help and answer your questions.
I visited many gardens during my trip around Japan - in Kyoto, Nara, Kanazawa... and this one was definitely my most favourite one!
It is a little bit out of town centre so with the transportation plan at least 3 hours or half a day to spend there.",

We entered the tea room in the reception building and sat down on the vacant seats. We were offered tea with 2 sugary little cakes. An explanation was given while the tea was being prepared. The tea was a strong green concoction. I haven't tasted it before in my life. It was a short yet fulfilling experience.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,"Not, Ebisu Gardens, But the Real Deal","Visiting the Yokohama City area and want a bit of tranquility and tradition, then you should visit the Sankeien Gardens. Recently, visitors wanted to see Japanese Gardens,and were directed to see Ebisu Gardens in Tokyo. Much to their disappointment, these are not gardens at all in the traditional sense but a huge shopping mall-like venue. So I took them to Sankeien, and they were amazed by the immediate transformation from modern city life, to the traditional, tranquil garden sights along with the beauty of the architecture that is trademark Sankeien.
There are ponds strategically placed and old wooden bridges with lotus blossoms peaking thru, while the carp in the ponds await your morsels of bread. . The bread is to be purchased at the nearby vendor and you can enjoy the pleasure of feeding the carp around the many ponds. The experience can be satisfying for children and adults alike.
The architecture and the landscaping are simply fantastic, and you will marvel at nearly every step you take, and will want to photograph it to keep as one of your treasured memories of your visit.
You can also take a rest while walking the gardens, as there are many benches provided and you can buy some light foods as well. There is also the opportunity to brown-bag or 'bento' your lunch as well. There are places to sit and have a nice lunch. Depending to the time of year, it can be a quiet, private time, or it can be a crowded and some of the tranquility is lost.
I've visited twice last year, and both were during the cold weather season, so not to crowded and very peaceful.
Another really great thing about it, is that you can call ahead and get the schedule for the tea ceremonies that are held inside the small museum area. The ladies are wear the traditional Japanese kimono and will demonstrate how tea is prepared. After preparing the tea, they serve you and explain how the tea should the receiver should drink the tea. It's a great experience for everyone. You can take great photos with the ladies sitting dressed in kimono in front of the tea making area (not sure what it's called).
The only thing that can be annoying sometimes is if it's crowded and then the experience is not as pleasant, but still a winner. You can always 'escape' the heavily populated areas as the gardens are so vast, that if you keep walking around, you can find a tranquil place and reflect. There is an entrance fee, and a bit on the pricey side, but there is a discount for the over seventy persons, with proper identification.
Depending on the season, there are different events being held at any given time, for example, fire fly night sessions, when specific flowers are in bloom, they sometimes have night events. So best to call ahead or check the net about what's going on. Enjoy!","Written February 17, 2015"

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,Hidden gem in Industrial Yokohama,"Sankeien Gardens is a slice of tranquillity located in the hustle and bustle of Yokohama.
These gardens and buildings are beautifully laid out with amazing scenery that gives you a great taste of Japanese culture landscaping and architecture.
An amazing view of the surrounding harbour and on clear days, Mount Fuji, is available from the lookout located near the 3-story pagoda.
Several small cafes/kiosks are located throughout the gardens selling a range of traditional snacks, ice-creams, cold and warm drinks.
Guided tours are available at different times although I was lucky enough to find a volunteer helper who was very keen to develop his English skills and happily guided me around the gardens explaining all of the details of the buildings, vegetation and general layout of the gardens. An English map is also available when you purchase your entry ticket to the garden.
My method of access to the gardens from Yokohama was via the train system on the Negishi Line to Yamate station. From here it is a quick 10 minute taxi ride to the gardens.
Taxi routinely service the entry to the gardens so access back to the train for return to Yokohama station is simple and convenient.

Very conveniently located, with plenty of space, ""far from the madding crowd,"" as Thomas Hardy would have put it.

Between us it only cost about $2.50 each ($10 Aust Total) and was very Convinent. Distance about 5KM.
As with most gardens in Japan there is an entrance fee but it is quite reasonable 500 Yen for Adults. We spent several hours exploring and enjoying the gardens which also contain 17 Historical Buildings that have been transported from other areas of japan and rebuilt within the Gardens. Unfortunatley only ONE is open for the Public to explore inside but the others are interesting from the outside.
The Gardens also have an Observatory and a 3 Storey Pagoda. A Main Pond and several other water features. All up I would say, Beautiful, Interesting and well worth Visiting. Allow about 3 Hours to enjoy properly.","Written September 26, 2014"

There are several little tearooms where you can find traditional refreshments such as shaved ice - we enjoyed cherry blossom ice cream.

Japan,Sankeien Gardens,An oasis in the concrete jungle,"Sankeien was originally the home and very spacious garden of a wealthy silk merchant. He bought a number of beautiful old buildings and had them brought to Yokohama, placed in the gardens and restored. There are temple buildings (including a pagoda), tea houses, a large farmhouse, a bridge, a lake, etc.

I have been to Sankeien many times over the years and never get tired of it. I recommend visiting on a weekday as early in the morning as possible, when there are fewer people, or later in the afternoon. It tends to get crowded on weekends. You can get there by bus or taxi from Negishi Station, on the JR Keihin Tohoku Negishi Line, which runs through Yokohama Station. Make sure you have a good look around the Inner Garden, which contains the best buildings, some of which are hidden amongst the trees.

The best time of year? Any season other than winter, when most of the trees have lost their leaves, the grass is brown and the garden is generally drab, unless you are lucky enough to visit after a rare fall of snow.","Written August 7, 2014"

The grounds are beautiful and the sculptures are nicely spaced and arranged. The pond has a small network of little paths coming off it which take you to various hidden gems. Bring 10 or 100¥ coins to feed the enormous koi! There are bathrooms in several different places through the grounds (by the two children's attractions and the gift shops) and the paths are wide enough to accommodate the traffic. My kids did ok with the scavenger hunt in the Picasso hall (otherwise would have suffered greatly) but they loved playing in the tree of nets but start there, it's gets crowded by 10-11 o'clock. We enjoyed the foot onsen, a nice break from the sculptures and art exhibits. Do this after the stairs up the tower--dont skip the tower, it may look unimpressive outside but it's amazing inside!
The water was very comfortable and the seating easily accomodates social distancing (but not wheelchair accessible). We got a beer and some baked gods from the restaurant and it's expensive compared to the states and I've had better food from other food counters at attraction in Japan but the lemongrass beer was good and the muffin vanished even though it was a big dry.
Not all spaces are stroller or wheelchair friendly (the tower, the pond, and the star garden) but the indoor exhibits all have access for mobility challenged.

However, with the possible exception of several of Picassos's works, where the reaction of 'Duuurh', 'What-the-heck', 'Really' & 'Nor me' seemed entirely appropriate, I really quite enjoyed it and found some quirky things to entertain and amuse.

Japan,The Hakone Open-Air Museum,Wish we had planned ahead,"We went into town to see the Hakone Museum of Art because of our interest in ceramics. We had some time after lunch and decided to walk over to the Open Air Museum (without having really researched it). We were blown away. Beautiful setting, well curated pieces. The two hours we had left were not enough to really appreciate everything. And this was on a cold, drizzling day. Can't imagine how nice it must be when the sun is out.","Written January 7, 2020"
Japan,The Hakone Open-Air Museum,Finish with a hot springs foot bath!,"Two hours was barely long enough for this amazing place, especially with two children who didn’t want to leave each of the Kid Art attractions! The museum was really an art gallery, with sculptures scattered around the beautifully kept grounds, with the bonus of a Picasso exhibition building. Even though the weather was a little drizzly, it was still a pleasure to wander the exhibits. For the kids, there were underground stairs, a spider web of ropes, a climbing box, though the maze was closed. On the way to the exit was a chance for the kids (and adults) to be ‘living sculptures’ with three further activities. Even the gift shop was well stocked with a wide variety of items. This attraction doesn’t seem to have the publicity it deserves! It’s a ten minute walk from the Hakone railway station.","Written January 7, 2020"

Who knew! Don't miss it if you are in the area. PLan to spend at least a morning or an afternoon. It'll be a highlight of your trip.",
Japan,The Hakone Open-Air Museum,Unexpectedly rich in sculpture and art,"We didn't realize Hakone is a bit of an art focused region, and the Hakone Open-Air Museum should really be considered one of the finest sculpture gardens in the world, with a hundred or so Picassos thrown into the bargain. This is worth every yen and two to three hours of your time.","Written January 4, 2020"
Japan,The Hakone Open-Air Museum,Great place,"The open air museum tries to harmonize art and its natural surroundings through well placed artefact's.

Japan,The Hakone Open-Air Museum,Art Overload,"A great chance to review many great pieces of art including some Picasso works. If you love art, perhaps a full day. Access through the sight can be difficult if you are not mobile. Steep areas and uneven paths. Plenty of photos and suggest starting onsite at 9am to be the crowds and get the morning light. There is some food onsite and a great sushi restaurant adjacent to the entrance towards the bus / train stations.",

Bring a towel or buy for Y100. 2 hour plus required.",

Japan,The Hakone Open-Air Museum,Amazingly beautiful setting to view art,This place was absolutely amazing . I just loved it from the moment I entered with the beautiful lawns surrounded by mountains as an extraordinary backdrop to the most fabulous sculptures from the likes of Rodin and Moore and Japanese sculptors. There is a Picasso gallery if you are into Picasso which I thought was alittle underwhelming. The museum shop was a little gem with some interesting giftlines. There is a bit of walking to take in all the park and some great kid spaces . You need a minimum of 2 hours to do this place justice and a bit more time would be beneficial.,

This visit was enjoyed by our kids just as much as DisneySea and probably a lot more enjoyable for us parents. We spent about 2-3 hours there. Not a lot of great food options. The restaurant area had s buffet and an alacarte, neither looked that appealing. We caught s taxi there from Hakone- Yumoto area (about 40 aud approx) and caught a bus back (train still not in operation after typhoon damage). They ran every 30 mins.

Japan,The Hakone Open-Air Museum,Enjoyable couple of hours,"We were lucky to be there on a dry day, I wouldn't recommend visiting on a very wet day because almost all of the sculptures are outside. I thought the range was very impressive and include several Henry Moore's & and at least one Hepworth (so the British were well represented). I must be the only person who wasn't very keen on the Picasso gallery, it just seemed to be a collection of unimportant pieces. The gardens were lovely but needed a bit of work (especially weeding).
We enjoyed the buffet lunch in the restaurant - basically eat as much as you wish from a very substantial number of options including serve yourself ice cream for a reasonable price.It's possible to get there using the Hakone Tozan Train so you could take the opportunity to both ride the switchback train and visit the museum.","Written November 6, 2019"

The setting for all this art is in a well manicured outdoor setting designed to show each art work in its best possible setting. Some pieces are displayed in water, others on the open lawn and others in alcoves or on the hill. This sculpture garden looks like a Disney theme park.

In addition to the sculpture there are several installations designed for young kids to play on. There is also a 300 piece Picasso collection of ceramics that has its own pavilion among the outdoor installations.

Japan,The Hakone Open-Air Museum,A real highlight in Hakone,"We went to this ‘museum’ just as it opened (9am) on a Wednesday morning. It was pretty warm but cloudy. We couldn’t believe what a high quality gallery/museum this is. The sculptures are nearly all outdoors, so maybe if it’s scorching hot or wet or cold it might not be as good, however when we went it was perfect. Also, we felt that we had the place almost to ourselves for the first 30 mins, which was really special!

The garden/landscaping is superb and as you go around you discover new delights around every corner. I know this sounds cheesy but it’s true. I’m no sculpture buff but I found plenty of interesting and exciting pieces.

Coffee at the lovely air-conditioned cafe was top notch. It’s also worth noting that the museum has luggage lockers out front for a deposit of 100 yen. We went on our last day in Hakone and we stashed our luggage here, saw the museum and then had lunch before collecting our bags. We spent 2.5 hours looking round.

Japan,The Hakone Open-Air Museum,Art and nature in perfect harmony,"Tip: get a discount with the Hakone Free Pass, additionally the pass will also cover your transportation up via the exciting Hakone Tozan railway as well as other forms of transportation round Hakone.
Students with student passes can also get student discounts.

While most travelers come to Hakone for the beautiful scenery, boat ride and osens, this open air museum is worth visiting, whether you are an art lover or not, as it is set in the midst of the beauty of Hakone’s natural surroundings with lush green mountains, valleys, trees and forests as it’s back drop. On a clear day, the entire environment is breath taking. Definitely worth a stop as you make your way round the Hakone loop. Most of the amazing art pieces were displayed outdoors, some of them were pretty huge and gigantic but they were also carefully placed in view of the natural surroundings and they were well spread out with lots of open space in between exhibits. There were also indoor exhibits such as a whole building dedicated to the works of Picasso.

Human descriptions do not do justice to the majestic display of art and nature here. One has to be physically there to experience its grandeur.",

The museum had a small gift shop. There was also Key Coffee which is small beverage and snack shop in the museum.

Best of all, the museum is free and parking is free.

One thing to note is that almost all of the exhibits had explanations in Japanese only. A few had english translations, so you have to really like aviation if you come to this museum and can't read Japanese.

Near the end, I saw a sign saying where to return your audio guide. But I never saw an area where you could get one. If you come here you may need to ask the staff where to get it.

The exhibitions are great to see. Weapons such as missiles are displayed together with reasonable explanations. You can get into the cockpits of exhibited airplanes which had flied in the air before. This may bring you the memorial photos.

Japan,Hamamatsu Air Park,"Several aircraft, weapons, simulator, and dress up as a pilot","The air park is free. It is amazing with kids, but also good fun as an adult.
Lots of interesting things to see: There is a variety of fighter jets, search and rescue and training plains exhibited. You can dress up as a pilot and takes photos.
There is a great simulator where you can practice take off, fight, and landing. For this you have to book a slot because it takes about 10 minutes and it is extremely popular. Best tactic is to go there, book your slot, explore the hangar, and then go there on time.
There are lots of additional displays and info on the work of the Defense Forces: rescue and peacekeeping operations overviews, what the role of the defense forces is, how the different kinds of aircraft support each other and ground forces, etc.
Many interesting weapons systems, radar systems, and other cool equipment can be viewed too.
There is also a simplified simulator for kids. Both are fun.
Most info is in Japanese, so having an audio guide or a good translation app (like the instant translator of google) is very practical.
Photography is allowed everywhere.
It is next to a real air base so you can sometimes see the current jets and helicopters coming and going, the staff training.
Getting there: you can do it by bus or cab. Former takes longer but is cheap, latter is quick but costs a bit more.
There is a cafe and restaurant, plus a gift shop packed with cute items and nice models for those who love aircraft.
Great fun, we had a lovely time there!","Written May 2, 2018"
Japan,Hamamatsu Air Park,Slightly disappointing,"Don't be put off by other people's comments - this place can easily be reached by public bus for a fare of around 500 yen each way on bus number 51. The bus trip takes about 20 minutes, and then you just walk 50m to the first corner, turn left, walk for about 15 minutes on this street until it ends in a T intersection and then you will see the Air Park right in front of you. The entrance is about 200m to the left when you come to the T intersection. The very helpful staff at the Hammamatsu tourist info will tell you all about it if you drop in. That's located in the JR Railway station.
The park itself was a bit disappointing for me. We went first to the museum part and only then did we find the display hangar (which was much better). All the simulator rides were booked out by 10am, so really it was a long trip for not much. My husband is an aircraft nerd, and he enjoyed it. I personally thought the Shinkansen museum in Nagoya was better.","Written March 5, 2018"

Japan,Hamamatsu Air Park,Fighter jets everywhere.,"The Hamamatsu airpark located north-west of Hamamatsu city is part of the Japan Self Defence Force facility. It is an active air force base so you will see jet trainers and helicopters in action while you visit this museum. The museum is located in an old hanger but has been modernised with static displays, models, videos, posters in one part of the building. When you walk into another part of the building, you will see an amazing collection of jet fighters from the Vampire, the Sabre, the Starfighter as well as Japan's own design jet fighters and many more aircraft including helicopters. This hall is absolutely amazing by the scope of the display and the fact that you can jump into a cockpit and pretend you are in Topgun. There is a fighter simulator which is fun with a closing canopy and controls like in a fighter but really simplified. The museum portion is over three levels with the third floor containing a cafe, library and more displays, At the ground floor entry is located a gift shop. The great thing about this attraction is that it is free however a cab ride is essential to get there. The price of a cab ride to and from Hamamatsu station should be between 2000 and 3000 yen. Finding a cab near the airpark is hard. Walk due east from the main gate to the airpark and you will come across a small shopping mall and there is a cab rank. Worth visiting if you love planes and aviation.","Written June 15, 2017"

Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,A lovely and calm trip out away from hustle and bustle! Lovely place.,Went here for a trip to get away from the city hustle and bustle. A very calm and peaceful place. When you get off the train at weekends there is a free shuttle service bus waiting for you that takes you to the door. And back again afterwards. So organised!! You pay for the tour and get an English speaking headset provided. You are taken round various parts of the site and it's all very interesting. They have a tasting session and a gift shop which was also brilliant. Warning - you won't get this at the Tokyo airports when you leave and they are too big for hand luggage - more than 100ml allowance so either buy small ones or put it in your case at high risk of breakage. I can tell you I have bought a bottle of Nikka Whisky in the UK since being back so don't worry about it. Great day out. Great experience.,"Written November 3, 2019"
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,Go if you like whiskey.,"I understand how people are up and down about the factory tour. It's 40+ minutes on the train from Sendai and then if you're not there during the weekend you have another 30-40 minutes walking to get into the hall. I did it on a day where it was probably 33°C and I'd already gone to see Yamadera. The humidity in the area is oppressive, and one of the Japanese tourists told me the area was picked in part for the humidity and how it would help create a great whiskey.

Japanese tours can be a little cold. You have to look at things through windows and a lot of what goes on in a distillery is just looking at pipes and tanks. You don't even get to see the Coffey still, though they will point out the building. I've heard that the VIP tour gets to see a barrel being charred, but you have to be a VIP in the minds of Nikka Whiskey, not in your own mind.

The best part is after the tour. There's a small bar where you can get short pours of Nikka for very little money. Where else can you even find Taketsuru 12, 17, and 21 and when I went the short pour of 21 was only ¥500! There was even a special edition Taketsuru that was ¥7,000 for a very short pour and I was glad I tried it.

I'd recommend finding a non-driving way to get there so you can taste a little of everything. During the tour they tell you there's three types of Yoichi that they blend to make the single malt (it's my understanding that they sort the barrels into different flavor categories) and I had a taste of the Peaty and Salty was worth tasting on its own.

Just remember, it might seem long way to go but just going from Osaka to Kyoto is going to take you longer and to me those cities are right next to each other.",
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,How to get there on a weekday with minimal walking,"I thought I would drop this line to anyone thinking of going to the Nikki factory near Sendai. I found lots of partial information before we went but nothing as specific as I would have liked. I use a walking stick so some of the options were not open to me (such as the 2.4 kilometre walk from Sakunami station).

So, if you want to get there with less walking, on a weekday (e.g., no shuttle bus) here is what to do

From Sendai Station, wait at bus stop number ten and take bus number 840 toward Sakunami Onsen. At the time of writing, the buses went at half past the hour (e.g, 11:30, 12:30 etc.). The bus trip is long (about an hour) and not that interesting, so you could take something to read.

Once on the bus you can read the screen at the front and keep an eye on station names, the Nikka factory stop does have a name and also an English advice message that this is where you get off for the NIkka factory. This is all good news because otherwise you look like you are getting off in the middle of nowhere. However there is a sign toward the NIkka factory, I just didn’t see it until I got off the bus. Follow that sign down the road and you can’t miss it, although even the walk into the factory is quite long for someone with a minor disability.

Once you get the to factory they have a list of all the train departure times from Sakunami (that is presuming you aren’t there on a weekend in which case there is the shuttle bus). Nothing I read online indicated the availability of taxis in the area, however they ARE available once you get there and the lady at the Nikka desk booked a taxi for us, even timing it to arrive at an appropriate time for the end of the tour plus shopping but in plenty of time to get to Sakanumi train station to catch the train back.

So that all worked perfectly for us. I won’t say more about the factory and tour, others have said it all. It was a nice day out and even more so as it was cherry blossom season and the place is quite beautiful at that time. Good luck in your whisky adventures.",
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,average visit experience and it takes over one hour to get there,"I only gave three points, because ... it is time consuming to get there and it only interesting for whisky buffs. And even then it is only an average destillery ... Let me explain.

Getting there: The destillery can be reached by bus. The bus is starting at JR Sendai station. There is only one bus per hour and the bus takes over one hour itself. From the bus stop it takes another 10-15 minutes walk. There is also a train. But the closest train station (Sakunami) is 2,5km away from the destillery. --> Visiting the destillery really takes half a day.

The destillery: The history of Whisky in Japan startet with Suntory and Nikka. Miyagikyo is the second big destillery of Nikka after the main destillery in Yoichi. For that reason alone the destillery is a point of interest for everyone who is interested in japanese whisky.

The destillery provides a guided tour that does not require a reservation in advance. Big bonus point. After the tour you can sample 2 whisky free. For any additional dram you have to pay. They have a wide amout of Nikka whisky you can chose from. You can sample 21 year old whisky without the need to buy the whole expensive bottle or you can sample a whisky that you will not find in a bar or a store outside Japan. The price for a dram is really fair. Specially if you consider the prices of whisky in a japanese bar. The tasting is a big selling point to visit the destillery. And you can also by some ""Destillery Edition"" whisky that you only can purchase here at the destillery and nowhere elsse. Big point.

And now the reasons why I only give three points:
(1) The time to get there and getting back to Sendai. It really takes half a day. The visitor center closes at 4:30pm. So you need to take a bus before 1pm to have enough time for the guided tour (1h) and some tasting (at least 1h) and get back to the bus stop in time.
(2) The first impression of the distillery is not that remarkable. It looks like a factory. This is killing the mood a little bit.
(3) The tour is quite ok but it is a standard tour that you can get in every destillery. You do not visit the Malting area and the mash tuns are behind glass.
(4) Miyagikyo is the origin of the ""Coffey Malt"" and the ""Coffey Grain"". But the tour does not cover the coffey still itself from that these whisky are coming from. The show a picture in the advertisement video bu that's it. This, in my opinion, is a big letdown! The Coffey Whisky is (for me) the major thing that seperates Miyagikyo from the rest. -- Even if the coffey still looks like something that belongs into a chemical lab or a oil raffinery. If own both coffey whisky and a really hoped to see there origin.",
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,Nikka fun outside Sendai,We visited the Nikka factory following our visit to the nearby Akio Onsen. Our daughter in law loves whiskey and as a native of Japan has wanted to visit this iconic factory known for its history of bringing Scottish whiskey making to Japan. The area is stunning with nearby waterfalls and woods. The factory is nestled in the green woods and serves up a great history lesson on the process of making fine whiskey. I have done similar tours in Rum factories in Jamaica and they are fascinating. You can also do a whiskey tasting after the tour as well. It was great fun and super enjoyable if you are in the area and have an hour or so to spare.,"Written May 9, 2018"

Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,Great day out and tasting,"The tour is in Japanese but they will provide a recording in English to follow along. The highlight of the tour of course is the tastings! Shuttle from Sakunami station and 3 generous glasses of high quality Nikka Whisky are provided (along with non alcoholic refreshments) free of charge. I highly recommend the tour. The paid samplers of aged whisky (including the award winning 17yr Takesuru blend) and the gift shop is reasonably priced.

Of course, as you'll be tasting alcoholic drinks the best way to travel is by train rather than bringing a sober driver. The JR line is convenient to Kita Sendai and Sendai stations but does not run very often (especially late in evenings or on Sundays or holidays). I do not recommend taking the last tour in the day as there will be a long wait at Sakunami station to return to the city.","Written October 3, 2017"

My favourite part was the funny little lanyard they give to the 'designated driver' to make sure they don't get served alcohol.","Written May 24, 2017"
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,Nice distillery tour,"Not to easy to get to from Sendai, but a train ride and good walk will be worth it for the whisky fan.

Tour is free, only in Japanse, but there is an English spoken device available.

There is also a shop with a load of distillery only bottles. Tasting bar is available as well (at a fee), in the tour a couple of drams are included as well.

You can take photo's everywhere, but no filming inside the facility.","Written April 15, 2017"
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,"Beautiful Setting, Average Tour","Nikka Miyagikyo Distillery

Access:
We drove to the distillery from Utsunomiya after a brief stop in Yamagata. Parking was easy and access to the main tour building was very convenient.

Tour Experience:
During our visit, the tour was only offered in Japanese, which was expected based on a quick phone call to distillery staff. There is no charge for the tour, which is very nice.

If you are someone who frequently visits other distilleries, you might find the tour lacking in detail and in the allowed proximity to the production processes. One of my favorite whiskies from Nikka is produced using their Coffey still. Tour members are not allowed to enter the building with the Coffey still, so that was somewhat disappointing. The giant pot stills are amazing to see in person. Tour participants finish their experience in the gift shop and tasting room. Some small samples of Nikka whiskies are offered to each tour participant.

Overall:
I would recommend visiting the Miyagikyo distillery, if you are already in the area. Even though I am an avid whisk(e)y lover, I did not find the experience worthy of making a special trip. In my personal opinion, the whole tour felt rather detached and cold. I think Nikka could learn a lot by benchmarking some of the Scottish or American Bourbon distillery tour experiences.","Written February 7, 2017"
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,Sightseeing,"Had a wonderful time there. Was just in time for the distillery tour． There was some whiskey tasting after the tour, but unfortunately couldn't participate.",
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,It's a good experience.,It help me understand Japanese whisky. But it's not easy to get there. I drove a rent car. It took 45 minutes from the Sendai station.,
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,Best Part Was the Sample Tasting at the end,"I believe going to a whiskey distillery is a good distraction. Alcohol is made pretty much the same way whether you're making beer or whiskey. Our tour was in Japanese (I was with Japanese people btw) so I didn't really learn anything new or interesting that I hadn't seen on a History Channel ""Modern Marvels"" re-run. The best part of the tour was being able to sample 3 different products at the end of the tour and I found a nice, smooth whiskey I liked. However, I couldn't even find that whiskey in Japan, not even in Sendai later on the day.","Written June 13, 2016"
Japan,Nikka Whisky Sendai Factory Miyagikyo Distillery,nice free tour,"To book a tour for English, you have to call or fax. We just dropped in. If there're a big tour, you might not get in the tour.

From Sendai JR Station, you take a train, but some trains don't go all the way to JR Sakunami Station, so check the time table for the train before you go. Otherwise, you'll end up waiting for the connecting train for an hour like us. For weekdays, there're free shuttle from JR Sakunami Station to the distillery. You can also take a local bus, but you have to walk about 10min from the bus stop to the distillery. If you want to walk from JR Sakunami Station to the distillery, it'd take 20min.

The tour is basically in Japanese only. For English speakers, you need to get a recorded tour and play at each station for English explanation. All displays are Japanese. When we visited on mid-April weekend, as we're the only participants, we're in a private tour.

The biggest fun is free tasting at the end. We're provided 2 kinds of whiskies and an apple wine. They also offer tonic to mix with whiskey and cold tea/soda for free. If you want to try high quality whiskies, you can taste for a pay at the bar. At the shop, you can also purchase different kinds of whiskies. Whiskies at Narita Duty-Frees sell only premium Nikka whiskies only (think $500 a bottle). Super Nikka isn't available at Narita Duty-Frees.","Written May 24, 2016"

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,The most gorgeous shrine among the temples and shrines in Nikko,"世界遺産に登録されている日光の社寺の中で、恐らく最も参拝客の多い神社と言えよう。
他の社寺と比較して、境内にある建築物の配色は色鮮やかで、梁や柱などに施された緻密な彫刻には目を見張るものがある。『絢爛豪華』とはまさにこの神社を指すのだろう。境内そのものが彫刻作品の屋外ギャラリーと言っても過言ではない。その分、写真撮影のために立ち止まる観光客も多く、特に土日祝日の日中の混雑ぶりは敬遠したくなる。建物の彫刻は勿論、建物内の絵画（鳴き龍や狩野探幽筆の麒麟等）も素晴らしく、数百年経過した今でもはっきりと鑑賞することが出来る（御本社や薬師堂等の建物内は撮影禁止）。
境内の各建物間の移動は基本的に階段であるため、車椅子等の障碍を持つ方等にとっては利用しづらいかもしれない。境内にはコインロッカー等は無いため、大きな荷物はホテルもしくは駐車した車内に置く必要がある。

Of all the shrines and temples in Nikko that are registered as World Heritage sites, it's probably the most visited shrine.
Compared to other shrines and temples, the color scheme of the buildings in the precincts is more vivid, and the intricate carvings on the beams and pillars are remarkable. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the precinct itself is an open-air gallery of carvings. However, they are the cause of many tourists stopping to take pictures, and the crowds during the day, especially on weekends and holidays, make you feel to avoid to visit there.
In addition to the carvings on the buildings, the paintings inside the buildings (such as Naki-Ryu (Singing dragon), and a Qilin by Kano Tanyu) are wonderful. Even after hundreds of years, you can still see them clearly (photography is not allowed inside the buildings such as the main shrine and Yakushido).
The buildings on the precincts are basically accessed using slightly bumpy passage or stairs, which may be difficult to use for people with disabilities such as wheelchairs. There are no coin-operated lockers in the precincts, so you'll need to leave your large luggage at your hotel or in your parked car.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Wonderful Without Crowds,"An excellent place if you time your visit outside peak hours. The Covid precautions were very good. The ""roaring dragon"" is a must see.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Beautiful Temple,"Simply amazing to see this place, detailed art work as you walk around. Don't forget to see the outer part of the shirne where you have to climb up 207 foot steps!","Written June 4, 2021"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Unforgettable experience,"This world heritage site is worth day trip to Nikko if visiting Tokyo. Straight forward to get here from Tobu Asakusa station and then a taxi or bus from Nikko station. The shrine was built for Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate that would govern Japan from 1603 until the Meiji restoration in 1867 and is a very elaborate set of different builds made out of wood with very complex and beautiful carvings and vivid colors. One of the greatest human architectural achievements.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,An absolute must for Japanese history buffs,"Easy to get to from Nikko station. Just take a bus for 200Yen from the station or get an all day pass if seeing all the sites and have time on hand.
The shrine is amazing craftsmanship in honor to Ieyasu Tokugawa Japans first Shogun after the warring states period.
I visited third week of November and there was still some lovely Autumn foliage to be seen.
The Cedars lined walkways and surrounding shrines and temples were lovely but this is definitely in my top 3 of all places visited in Japan.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A Must Visit,What a great day trip from Tokyo. The train trip from Tokyo was relaxing and once there you get on the bus that takes you to the Shrine. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and you will know why when you visit. The Shrine was completed in 1636 and it took 4.5 million artisans and workers 1.5 years to complete the groups of buildings that are more elaborate and gorgeous than any other Japanese temple or shrine. There are a lot of steps but it is doable if you are not rushed. Especially the steps to Leuasu Toshogu's grave site. One thing to know is that the Shinzo Sacred Bridge is an extra fee to cross and once you get across you have to go back across to exit that site and go on to the Shrine.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Gorgeous and stunning,"This beautiful temple is a must-see if you're visiting Japan. Wander through the temple, admire the exquisite attention to detail, and soak in the history (it was built in the 16th century). Specifically, look for the carving of the Three Monkeys, which are the basis for the ""hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil"" monkeys that are common nowadays. It's a calm place, even when there are a lot of visitors.","Written May 7, 2020"

Anyway, having a nice weather You can admire all the details of the temple complex, however, during heavy rains there is not so many tourists ;-). The temple is one of the most impressive in Japan. The whole complex was financed by the son and grandson of Ieyasu Tokugawa after his death. There is also his grave, over the temple - worth to see. One of the calmest and tranquill places I saw. There is also one of the most famous wooden sculptures from that times: three monkeys - worth to see.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Japan twice Nikko twice,"Nikko is a fantastic place, if coming by train your last link takes you onto a beautiful retro styled train up the mountainside to Nikko proper. outside the station to a countryside square. The village looks up the small valley to a forest of trees (covered in snow in my trips). If you wander up the hill you will find yourself at the start of the major shrine complex of Tosho-gu just after crossing the river. The stone steps and ramps wind their way up till you make the enormous tori gates. The complex itself has a combination of the more subtle Japanese Temples, but is also one of the most gaudy i have been to done in filigree and ivory. The carvings are stunning.

If visiting i strongly recommend bringing your Goshuincho, or purchasing one to be filled out. (Just make sure to pay your respects first), as their are several spots on site to receive the stamp.

I've been to Japan twice as well as Nikko now and will plan to make Nikko at least my one re occurring stop every trip from now. If you like nature and temple or shrines architecture and history stay a few days. Theres a lot to see.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Winter feel of the Shine,We were lucky to visit the Shine after snow fall to have the feel of winter in this famous world heritage site. The compound of this Shine is big and the buildings are very well preserved in each of the corner. Prepare to walk in on long and steep steps as the Shine is built on a hill. Visit in the early morning is a better strategy to avoid crowds from tour buses.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Stands out from many other shrines, super ornate","Toshugu Shrine stands different from Kyoto shrines in it’s design and ornateness, and on a misty day like the one we went provides a beautiful aura of mystery. There are many structures in the building, and a lot of the animal drawings have deep symbolic meanings. There are rooms to honor ‘Lord’ Ieyasu in whose honor it is built, and often need to queue in order to enter there. There is the crying dragon room, where they will demonstrate how it makes a noise when clapped. There is overall a sense of beauty and mystery about this shrine and it’s uniqueness in design makes it well-worth visiting. At 1300 yen a head, it’s definitely expensive. We didn’t go past sleeping cast to climb stairs as we were already very tired in our trip and didn’t want to do more to exhaust our feet.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Easy to navigate and lots of photo opportunities...,"I came here specifically because it is considered one of the most opulently decorated shrines and mausoleums in Japan.

It did not dissapoint. The location is magical, set on a mountain side amongst some towering old growth trees. It is faily compact, so can easily be navigated and there are large courtyards around all the buildings so I found it pretty easy to get nice shots without people in them. And the details are amazing - as a serious amateur photographer I really had a field day here!

However, I was lucky because it was a beautiful day and train service had been disrupted to Nikko on the Tobu railway line, so there were a lot less people than usual.

Anyway, well worth the visit and I will be back to take more photos.","Written December 6, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Absolute must-see,"Was skeptical about visiting a famous site in Japan, after having encountered zillions of tourists at other places.
Was pleasantly surprised that this one was much less crowded and therefore easier to enjoy..
I've seen many temples and shrines in Japan. Needless to say they don't hold a candle to Toshogu. Absolutely stunning.","Written December 4, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,The World Heritage Shrines of Nikko are simply stunning.,"So the first thing people need to understand is that getting to Nikko to visit the World Heritage Shrines (including Nikko Toshogu Shrine) and Shinkyo Bridge is something you can do by yourself as a Day Trip from Tokyo. BUT you do need to be leaving Tokyo early, by that I mean no later than 8:00am, by train. I will now walk you through the route I took and the costs involved, which I hope will be of great help to others.
I was staying in Shinjuku so my travel starts and ends there but as Shinjuku is a prominent and easy station to get to my route could be easily followed. Note there are other routes you can take but my research found the cost and timings of this one to be best. So from Shinjuku I took the Saikyo Line (JA) 4 stops to Akabane Station (15 minute ride). From Akabane Station I then took the Utsunomiya Line (JU) 11 stops to Kurihashi Station (46 minute ride). This portion of the journey cost JPY990 using a Suica Card (a train pre-payment card). From Kurrihashi take the Tobu-Nikko Express Line (TN) 7 stops to Tobu-Nikko Station (74 minute ride). This portion of the journey cost JPY985 on my Suica Card. I left Shinjuku Station at 8:19am and I got to Tobu-Nikko at 10:44am - So a total journey time of 2 hours 25 minutes with a total cost of JPY1,975. All the train changes were easy and when to get to Tobu-Nikko Station simply exit at the main exit and walk straight ahead to the main road then turn right and walk about 25 minutes to Shinkyo Bridge and the entrance to the World Heritage Shrines. To get back to Tokyo simply reverse the route. I left Tobu-Nikko at 5:32pm and was back in Shinjuku for 8:15pm, so a 12 hour day but this gave me plenty of time to explore all of the Shrines and the Bridge. Well worth the effort, not too expensive and an amazing cultural adventure.
I recommend buying your tickets for the Shrines you want to visit at the ticket office located in the Tobu-Nikko Station. This is far easier than fighting the long lines for tickets at the Shrines themselves. I bought tickets for all the Shrines and by doing this you get 'combination' discounts.
The Shrines themselves are beyond words, they are simply stunning and look great located in amongst the talk forest trees. A very unique experience. Do wear sensible shoes (trainers or walking shoes) as there is a fair bit of walking involved and some of it is up old steps. Not much else to say other than ""Do Go"" and do look at my pictures as they speak 1000 words.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Loved the setting and the temples,"Did this as a day trip from Tokyo, approximately 2 hours each way. Once in NIkko it is about a half hour walk to the temples. You can take a bus, but I enjoyed the walk. The walk at times is somewhat steep if you have trouble with that. The temples are basically in a large park/forest and that makes them even more lovely. A guide would have been helpful to understand more of what I was seeing, but the setting and the temples were just beautiful and a nice break from Tokyo.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Temples and shrines.,"Mostly temples and shrines. We didnt do a guided tour, but maybe that would have made a big difference.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Highlight of the trip to Nikko,"The Nikko Tosho-gu Shrine is a wonderful place to visit. It is so much rooted in Japanese history to the time of the Shoguns and is an example of the power and influence they had in Japanese history and development as a culture and people. This is absolutely a World Heritage Site, first class no doubt. The architecture is complex and elaborate in detail. There are over 100 buildings on the site and most date to the 17th Century. In particular, the shrines embody the influence of the great Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu. The artifacts contained in the shrine illustrate the power and great influence the Shoguns had. A must visit in Japan.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing,For me this was the star of the World Heritage site. Well worth taking your time and exploring it all. There were a fair amount of people but that is to be expected. The carpentry and carvings are amazing and I took far too many picture to share here. You can't go to Nikko and miss out on this.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Big hordes of tourists,"1. You can purchase tickets at Tobu-Nikko station through a vending machine. This will help you save time queuing for it at the shrine. The machine accepts credit cards.

2. Alight at bus stop 7 (we took ""World Heritage Bus Loop"") and walk from Shinkyo bridge to the shrine. It's an easy 15 mins walk with some stairs along the way.

3. Be prepared to be surrounded by huge hordes of tourists, this being one of the UNESCO sites and all. Audio guides are available inside shrine (after giving ticket at entrance) for additional cost.

4. The architecture is beautiful and intricate. But other than that, it's noisy, crowded and underwhelming due to the crowds. Especially in hot summer months, this can get aggravating.

Having said that, we still enjoyed parts of Nikko for our day trip that does not have as many crowds.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Worth the day trip to Nikko!,"Beautiful temple with amazing detail in the different buildings. Green surroundings are a plus to this monument.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Am-az-ing!,"It is absolutely stunning: the temples, trees, grounds, carvings, and architecture.We were fortunate to go on a misty, light drizzle day. It made the atmosphere amazing and meant very few people. We loved climbing up to the tomb, even though there are lots of steep steps. This site is not to be missed- just gorgeous.","Written September 7, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Just before closure,It is worth to pay for the entrance. We planned our visit about 45 minutes before closure. It meant that we were almost the last to see everything and we were able to get beautiful pictures without a lot of people. I would recommend to do the same.,"Written September 5, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Lovely, check out the dragon shrine","Nice to walk around and see the different shrines. Make sure to check out the dragon shrine where you could hear „the roar of a dragon“, they had some explanation in Ebglish although the majority of tourists were locals so we found it very kind of them. On the opposite side, there are many stairs up leading to the tomb of the monk.. not aure how worth it except for the view from above.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing architecture,"It goes without saying that this is the place you will definitely visit when in Nikko. The architecture is amazing and the statues and decorations also.

It takes about 30 minutes to get there by foot from the station and about another hour to visit. A guide makes sense. Entrance is 1300 Yen.

If you are in a hurry, you can skip the Rinnoji temple on the way, it’s not that impressive.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Highlight of Nikko,"Beside Hakone and Mount Fuji, Nikko is one the most popular tourist destinations in Japan. And Toshogu is the highlight of Nikko. Not just the grave of Ieyasu, but Yomeimon Gate and other constructions are really worth taking a look. You shouldn’t overlook some sculptures like “sleeping cat” or “three monkeys”. You can rent an audio guide in English for $5 at the main gate. Then you can better understand the history.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A wonder,"""Nikko Tosho-gu"" is a wonder, temples and gates and pavillions are superb, there are so many incredible details: wood carved animals and plants, fine engravings, golden leaves coating, etc. Take your time to enjoy all of these amazing buildings full of art, it's a pleasure for your heart and your mind.","Written August 27, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Not enjoyable,"If you like shuffling around shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of other tourists then this is the place for you!
In my opinion this place is too commercialized and it ruins the overall atmosphere of what is a beautiful collections of shrines. After hearing about the history of Nikko I was keen to visit here but I left exhausted and disappointed.
Big tour groups ruin the experience for other travelers here with loud microphones, tens of peoples chasing after a umbrella holding guide barging anyone else in existence out of the way.
If you are not obligated to go here because of a booked tour, please go somewhere else, it will be more enjoyable. The only quiet area was up a lot of steps where it was much nicer and a good view from the top.","Written August 25, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Opulence at its best,"Having visited other Japanese shrines, this world heritage site seemed to be more about wealth than a spiritual presence. Yes the colored carvings were impressive, but the cost of 1300 yen is only for the main shrine complex. It’s another 500/900 yen for Rinnoji temples with the stunning 3 images of the female Buddha.
Be prepared to queue to hear the crying dragon caused by the acoustics in the temple and to gain entry into the main oratory.","Written August 16, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Great 1 day destination for Edo Period forested temples.,"We bought tickets days ahead for the 9 AM luxury 'Revaty"" Tobu-Nikko train from Tokyo Asakusa Station, and the 15:30 PM standard 'Spacia' for our return(~$75 for 2 which included their 2 day Nikko Pass).
After arriving at the Tobu-Nikko Station at 11 AM, we boarded the included World Heritage Bus(just outside) for the slow trip through this overcrowded town to the bus route's highest point, then joined the tourists walking 1+ km up through the shaded forested lanes to the highest UNESCO Nikko Futarasan Shrine. After the visit, we walked down to visit the 2nd UNESCO Nikko Toshogu Shrine, then down to the 3rd UNESCO Nikko Rinno-ji Buddhist Hall, then down to the UNESCO Shinkyo Bridge. From here we stopped at the nearby Hippari-Dako Restaurant(quick delicious lunch) on the 1.6 km walk down to the Tobu-Nikko Station for our return back to Tokyo.
Walking was the only reasonable option as the streets were only 'stop N go' with so many cars(only motorcycles could make any reasonable progress) on this new 2016 National holiday, ""Mountain Day"".",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A must see in Nikko,"Checking out we drove to Nikko Toshogu 日光東照宮. It is the shrine built to worship the first generation of Tokugawa Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu 徳川家康. Ieyasu is born in Dec 1542 December at the Okazaki Castle in Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture.

He has struggled since childhood and is determined to end the warring era. He had established the Makuhari system 幕藩体制. With the resumption of order and the system to organize, promoting the industry and education, he laid the foundation of peace and culture for 260 years in the Edo period.

In 1616, Ieyasu died at the age of 75, at the Gonfu Castle 駿府城 in Shizuoka, and was buried in Kunosan 久能山. Based on his will one year later, his body was moved from Kunosan to the present place. The second generation Shogun Hidetada 秀忠 then started the construction of Toshogu.

The main structure of the present shrine is the one rebuilt in 1636 by the third generation Shogun Ikeiko 家光. Covering 55 buildings, the total investment to construct the shrine is mind-blowing, basically engaging all the best craftsmen during the time. It is now a recognized as an UNESCO site.

Almost all of the present-day shrine complex was rebuilt in 1636, twenty years after Tokugawa Ieyasu’s enshrinement. Fifty-five buildings, including Yomeimon Gate 陽明門 (designated a National Treasure), were completed in just one year and five months.

According to the shrine’s financial records, the cost was equivalent to ¥40 billion in today’s money. The renovation project was administered by Akimoto Yasutomo, the governor of Tajima Province, and the actual construction and carpentry work was under master carpenter Kora Bungo Munehiro.

One of the special features of the shrine complex is the use of paths and stairways that follow the natural topography of the site, allowing the arrangement of the shrine buildings in a pleasing balance to create a solemn, religious atmosphere.

The buildings are lacquered and decorated with vibrant colors, and the pillars and other structures are covered in a multitude of carvings. The carvings are not simply design elements; they convey expressions of religious belief as well as scholarship and philosophy.

The shrine complex was registered as a World Heritage site in December 1999.
Ishidorii (石鳥居) was dedicated in 1618 by Kuroda Nagamasa, the feudal lord of Kyushu Chikuzen (present day Fukuoka Prefecture). The stone for the gate was transported by ship from Kyushu to Koyama and then manually hauled over land to Nikko.

Gojunoto (五重塔) was dedicated in 1648 by Sakai Tadakatsu, the feudal lord of Obama in Wakasa Province (present day Fukui Prefecture). It was destroyed by fire in 1815 and rebuilt in 1818 by Sakai Tadayuki, a feudal lord of the same lineage.

Omotemon (表門) is the first gate at Toshogu Shrine. It is also called Nio Gate because of the two guardian deity statues positioned on the left and right.

Sanjinko (三神庫) is the collective designation for three buildings: Kamijinko (Upper Sacred Storehouse), Nakajinko (Middle Sacred Storehouse), and Shimojinko (Lower Sacred Storehouse). Harnesses and costumes used in the Procession of 1,000 Samurai, (a part of the Sacred Processions held in spring and fall), are kept in the storehouses. Large elephant carvings by Kano Tanyu adorn the gable of Kamijinko Storehouse. They are known as the “Imaginary Elephants.”

Shinkyusha (神厩舎) is the former a stable for the shrine’s sacred horses. There is a frieze of eight panels of carvings of monkeys running around the building, depicting the lives of ordinary people. Monkeys have been regarded as guardians of horses since ancient times. The “See No Evil, Speak No Evil, Hear No Evil” carving of three monkeys (三猿) is particularly famous.

Omizuya (御水舎) is the building with the water bath to purify body and mind by washing one’s hands and rinsing out one’s mouth before worshiping the enshrined deity. The basin was dedicated in 1618 by Nabeshima Katsushige, feudal lord of Kyushu-Saga.

Yomeimon Gate (陽明門) is a National Treasure, one of the most beautiful gates in Japan. It is said to have been given the name “Main Gate of the Imperial Court.” It is also called “Gate of the Setting Sun” because one could gaze upon it all day and never tire. It is covered with over 500 carvings depicting traditional anecdotes, children playing, sages and wise men.

Kairo (廻廊) is the exterior wall of the building extending to the left and right of Yomeimon Gate, decorated with flower and bird carvings that are considered among the best in Japan. All the carvings are single-panel openwork painted in vivid colors.

Karamon Gate (唐門) is painted with a white powder chalk, featuring intricate carvings of Kyoyu and Soho (legendary Chinese sages), an audience with the emperor, and other scenes.

Gohonsha (御本社) is another National Treasure, with the Main Shrine consisting of the Honden (Main Hall), Ishinoma (Stone Chamber), and Haiden (Worship Hall). It is the most important area at Toshogu Shrine. Annual festivals and events are conducted here. Haiden Hall is flanked by the Shogun Chakuzanoma (Shogun’s Chamber) and Hosshinno Chakuzanoma (Prince’s Chamber).

Shinyosha (神輿舎) houses the three portable shrines used in the Sacred Processions conducted in spring and fall (May 18 and October 17), while Kitoden (祈祷殿) is used to host weddings, rituals for new-born babies, and other ceremonies.

Nemurineko (眠り猫) was traditionally attributed to the master carver Hidari Jingorou. This carving of a cat dozing while surrounded by peonies and bathed in sunlight is also said to be a depiction of nikko (sunlight).

Okumiya (奥宮) is the tomb of the enshrined deity. It consists of the Haiden (Worship Hall), Inukimon Gate, and Gohoto (Two-Story Pagoda).",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A must see in Nikko. Wow,Wow . An amazingly beautiful place which was bigger than I expected. From the entrance through past the Yomeimon gate up the 270 steps to Leyasu’s treasure tower and ashes is beautiful. You visit the Sacred Fountain built in 1618 and the Pagoda . Look out for the sleeping cat carving. The shrine took two years to build and is the work of 15’000 artisans. It was a hot day when we visited and there were lots of tourists but it was still a pleasure to wander around. I must have taken at least 50 photos. I loved it all. After you visit take the left road lined with lanterns to the Taiyuin -byn shrine which is just as impressive. It took us the whole morning to wander around these two shrines. Note this is not a good place for young children or people with mobility problems due to the number of steps.,"Written August 1, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Worth a visit....,"It’s a crowded place even on a rainy day. Paid ¥1,300 for the entrance fees and worth the visit. Could easily spend a few hours here. Rich in history but felt that the architecture has some Chinese influence.

To reach the place where one of the shogun(?) was buried it’s a flight of 207 steps. Certainly not for the old who may have climbing stairs problem. The entrance is the viewing of the sleeping cat carving at the entrance of the door. It’s followed by crane carving at the second entrance. Then a short walk to the super long flight of steps.

There is also a temple that you could enter to join in the prayer (if u understand japanese). And there is another prayer room (not for prayer) which has the painted dragon on the ceiling. It’s interesting and should definitely go in (May have a queue). There are explanations and they do try to explain in simple English. Good experience!",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Kegon Falls and Nikko Pass,"Went in summer (June) and it was raining. Very cold and windy.
The cafe owner is wonderful, on the heater to keep us warm while waiting for bus ride down the hill. The Falls at the observation deck is beautiful. Cannot image when it is Spring or Autumn. The Nikko All area pass include the bus ridge from Nikko Station and also the Rope (two-way).
It is good to get a Nikko All area pass for unlimited bus rides and visits. To top up a bit more to get the unlimited express from Asakusa to Nikko (2-way)",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Awesome Sculptures at Shrine wishing for eternal peace,The sculptures are just breathtaking. EVen I visited dozens of times I haven't gotten tired of it yet. It's so amazing.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Wonderful!,"There are many places you must visit in the case you are nearby. However, this is a place where it is worth to have a long train from Tokyo.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,The historic temple,"Tosho-gu is the must see temple in Nikko, and probably your Japan trip if you can spare the time. A highlight besides Tokugawa Ieyasu's mausoleum was Honjido Hall as the ""Crying Dragon"" was very interesting.
One thing I did'nt know until I arrived was that on May 17-18, Tosho-gu has a festival, something I wish I'd known before arriving(I was there the 13th).
Also as most popular temples, if you want the Goshuin, make sure you go to that counter before exploring the temple, because most likely you will have you leave your Goshuincho(your Goshuin book,you can also buy one here) here and come back for it later, there's also another Goshuin at the mausoleum's site, but that one is prewritten in a sheet of paper for an obvious reason.","Written June 14, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,An attractive historical shrine,"This was one of our destinations of Nikko tour. Since it was the Golden Week, there area was over crowded where we got stuck in traffic more than an hour to enter. We had to park the vehicle far away from the entrance and walk.

We took the steps up to the shrine which was so interesting. The complex is really vast and fascinating. Walking through the forest and huge wall fences will take you to centuries ago. Can spend couple of hours by exploring the mind blowing architecture of shrines. Although the place is over flowing with tourist, you will not get distracted to enjoy the beauty.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Great must see historical site,"We took a full day trip from Tokyo and spent the entire day in Nikko to see the Nikko Tosho-go Shrine as well as the Jizo Statues, the Shinkyo Bridge and the 3 waterfalls in the area: Kegon, Yu-daki, and Ryuzo waterfalls.

The only way to see all of this in one day from Tokyo is to take a private tour which is obviously more expensive but we got to see everything in one day and did not have to do any navigation ourselves. The tours we saw where you take a bus with 60 other people and only visit the shrine seemed very limiting and not allowing any time to see anything else. Obviously if you chose to stay in Nikko then you could probably explore the area for a couple of days.

The shrine is amazing and is currently undergoing extensive renovation. There are parts of the shrine where some of the details have been renovated in great detail and look as though it was just created. There are several buildings on the grounds; some of which you can go into if you take your shoes off and others of which you can only see from the outside.

The walk into the shrine through the forest and past the sake barrels and wine barrels takes you back in time. Depending on how much you want to see there is also a cemetery which is a long steep hike up many stairs.

You could easily spend a couple of hours exploring just this shrine and since it is very popular it is also very crowded but that did not take away from any of the amazing views or experience of the shrine grounds. The day we were there was a week where Japanese children travel in large groups so we would often wait for the group to be out of an area or go to a part of the shrine where there was less people. Anybody could do this and get away from the majority of the crowds.

I would highly recommend that you either take a private tour from Tokyo so that you can see as much as we did or go up to Nikko and spend a day or two so that you can see the area in detail.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A must see in Nikko,"If you are in Nikko you must come to the Tiago-gu. Just take in to account that it can be very crowded.
To enter in some area inside the building you need to remove the shoes",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,World heritage wonderful mossy sprawling temple,"This is the must see sight for Nikko. So nice to wander and climb amongst the unique buildings in a tranquil forest setting. The main hall is still partially covered by scaffolding as part of overrunning renovations. This a shame but still a must see. It would be 5 star when that is completed.
It can get very busy but if you stay nearby you can get there midweek before the tours.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Definitely something to see - just amazing,"We came to Nikko in part to see Tosho-gu and we were not disappointed. The temple complex is amazing and beautiful with lots to explore. The temple is undergoing restoration but this did not detract in any way from our visit. Much of the area has already been restored and it is beautiful, giving confidence that when all the work if finally completed, it will be amazing. I would not miss this if you are in the Nikko area. Although we stayed overnight in Nikko for two nights, one can come to Nikko from Tokyo and visit the sites and return in the same day.","Written June 4, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A lot of steps,"The grounds at this temple are expansive, and it's built into the hill. As a result, expect for there to be a lot of steps to climb if you want to see everything. As it's also a relatively famous temple, be prepared to face a lot of crowds. However, the flow is quite orderly and we weren't fighting to move around. Give yourself plenty of time to take it slow here, and you won't be stressed about having to see it all before moving on.

The traditional architecture is amazing. The place is well kept; during our visit, the inner temple was in the process of being restored. It was still open for the public to view, but there were scaffolds surrounding an inner wall.","Written June 1, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing!,"A must-do in Nikko. The shrines are absolutely beautiful and pictures really don’t do it justice. Even though it was crowded, we had a wonderful time.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing Temple and Shrine Complex,"The setting on the forested hillside imparts a sense of serenity. The gold and wood carvings are more intricate and opulent than at all other shrines. The Toshogu Shrine (Tokugawa Ieyasu's mausoleum) was extremely crowded with school children and other Japanese and international visitors. It is still an awesome site not to be missed.

For a quieter experience head further into the forest to Taiyuin, the third Shogun's mausoleum. It is smaller and just as beautiful with few visitors. Be aware that you need to go up and down at least a hundred steps. I did not count them.","Written May 30, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Must see- tips below!,"To see Nikko properly you need two full days. A day trip from Tokyo is tricky to do more than one of the following.
- TIME: You’ll have to take the JR Nikko or Tobu rail to Nikko station which takes about 40 mins from Utsumoniya. Then either walk 30 mins into town (seeing all the shops on the way) or take a bus pass so you can reach all the sights. Get there as early as possible if you’re there for the day.
- BUS PASS: about 3000 yen each for the two day pass. Or less for a day pass. It’s worth it to save your legs and time! If you only have 5 hrs then just relax and aim only for the shrines
- Toshogu and other shrines: it’s NOT cheap to go around the shrines. To get into Toshogu it’s 1300 yen as an adult and 500 yen for the audio guide. id definitely pay to go in and get the audio guide to the main sights. Lots of explanation. If you get there early you miss the crowds. This will take about 2 hours at least!
- relax over lunch: find a local restaurant to enjoy Yubu which is a local delicacy!
- Shinkyō bridge: don’t have to pay 300 yen each to cross the bridge, you get to see it very clearly and get a better photo from the man made bridge right next to it!

Lake and waterfall: if you have one day you REaLLY CANT do the shrines and this and also enjoy yourself. After taking the JR Nikko you have to take a 50-60 min bus to reach this area. Then it’s about 3-4 hrs to enjoy the walks and scenes minimum. Maybe take a sandwich, definitely take water if hiking or doing a long walking.","Written May 18, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Most beautiful shrine in Japan,"This is the most beautiful shrine I've ever visited in Japan. Every part of the shrine is carved beautifully.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Epic, gorgeous, fascinating","Toshogu is Nikko's centre-piece and I can see why - the complex is big, the buildings are ornate and beautiful, the forest is amazing. Do take the time to walk up the steps to Tokugawa Ieyasu's mausoleum, this was my favourite part. The design here is a stark contrast to the rest of the shrine complex, it's fascinating to see how different it is.

I spent about 1.5 hours here.","Written June 13, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Uplifting experience,"We took the train from Tokyo to Nikko just for the Tosho-gu, a huge complex of about a dozen Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, and it was worth it. The grand and beautifully structured Toshogu, with its pinnacle standing at equal height from sea level with the tip of Skytree Tower in Tokyo, is the centerpiece and towers above the rest. One of the shrines within complex is the final resting place of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate that ruled Japan for 250 years.","Written May 10, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Don’t miss it in every seasons.,"You should visit here to feel sacred atmosphere. You can see many special buildings, gates and etc. On the late spring, around May you can see many cherry blossoms. On summer you can see many beautiful green trees. On autumn you can see the leves colored yellow and red. And also you can see some places covered with snow in winter. You’ll see different sceneries every season here in Nikko.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,UNESCO temple.,"The purpose of this Shinto temple lies in his name. Tōshō-gū means ""Dedicated to Tokugawa."" Here is the tomb of the founder of the Tokugawa dynasty. The founder himself attached little importance to the construction of temples, and more to wars, food and women. The last two Hobbies undermined the health of the first shogun. The last will of Ieyasu was to bury him a year after his death on mount Nikko and build a small temple. The grandson was considered a small temple unbecoming the honor of a great grandfather and it was extended to its current limits. The temple combines the external simplicity in the aesthetic spirit of Wabi Sabi and the abundance of decorative carvings, the three monkeys are the most famous example. A long road and a five-storey pagoda give the temple additional solemnity.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A stand out temple to visit,"Even for people who are not really 'into' temples, I think would find this one interesting. For a start the setting with the surrounding huge trees is beautiful and peaceful - if you can ignore the crowds - but the buildings themselves are so over the top with decoration that they are without doubt the star attraction here.
There are so many different buildings that make up the complex and so many differing styles of decoration that it really does take some time to explore, and despite the fact that there was renovation going on during our visit, it didn't really impact too much or detract from the beauty of the place. A lot of signage in English helps to understand what the different structures were used for. Take your time and explore the whole precinct, there is so much to see. A definite must see in Nikko, which is itself an easy day trip from Tokyo. If you come by train, take the bus up here and then walk back, exploring the other sites along the way, as its then mostly downhill.","Written April 28, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Beautiful.,"Went here with my fiancé and it was absolutely beautiful. Of course temples if you're into that, but nature itself is just breathtaking. Take a walk up the hill and enjoy the peace you won't find many places.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Gorgeous!,The buildings are brilliantly painted and decorated. The temple is being restored but you are still able to enter and look around. It is incredible to see the work that has been done. You can see some areas that are chipped and faded then others where the gold leaf glitters and the lacquer and metal work shine.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Wonderful temple landscape,"There are so many temple and shrines to visit. One day is not enough! If you have the chance to get off the beaten path and wonder through the woods, definitely do so, you’ll stumble across so many hidden temples.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Lumps of falling snow added dramatic effect to the shrine,"It was April and I didn't quite expect Nikko to be that cold, coming from a 'humid' country I was surprised. The details of the deities to the intricate structure, all in all Nikko Toshogu was stunning to look at. Expect huge crowds to be in great awe. I took the World Heritage bus (having World Heritage pass gives me free bus rides) I thought I could just be skipping Nikko Toshogu for 30 mins, but I was surprised it took me average of 2 hours tops to visit nearby shrines as well. Kosanji (in Setoda) and Nikko would be one of my best highlights as I am eager to discover new shrines outside or further from Tokyo.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,The Greatest Shrine in Japan.,"There is no question about it.This shrine is the greatest in Japan. After I visited here.I would like to write a couple of tips in order to enjoy Toshogu.
1.You have to walk.You can use a bus or taxi.But you have to walk in the shrine.Japanese love walking.But if you don't like walking.You need to give up visiting here.I was not sure if Toshogu has a courtesy wheel chair service.
2.Please study Japanese history.At least, you need to learn Ieyasu Tokugawa's achievements. This is his shrine.You need to learn him.
3.I visited here on April 17th 2019.I could enjoy sakura flowers(Cherry blossoms) It was relatively warm.But Nikko is usually cold like Canada or North Europe.I guess that months from April to October are a good time to go.
4.Please respect no photograph policies.Toshogu doesn't allow you to take pictures at some of the buildings.
5.If you can, please walk from Nikko stations to Toshogu.There are many interesting stores restaurants. There is a tourist information center between the stations and Toshogu.
6.Please try local cuisine 'Yuba"".(tofu skin)/
Enjoy Nikko!",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing!,"The Tosho-gu located at Nikko is an amazing collection of fortifications and buildings dedicated and built during the Edo period ruled by the Tokugawa family (Shogunate). You literally stride through history following in the footsteps of samurai & the shoguns. As you walk underneath the Torii gates, marvel at the 5-story pagoda with it's center pole designed to withstand earthquakes (light years ahead of it's time), the Yōmeimon (Gate of Sunlight) that is literally jaw-dropping in it's beauty and intricate detail. Traversing the walkway and stairs (207) that lead to the tomb of Ieyasu Tokugawa, take a moment to look out & realize you are standing in the same spots where samurai once stood guard. To view everything one should plan on spending at least a day & even then you will not see everything. There is considerable walking involved so prepare accordingly with appropriate clothing & footwear, but you will need to slip your shoes off to enter some of the structures. Tosho-gu is not to be missed & cannot wait to return.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Spectacular Shinto Shrine part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Expect crowds.,"We took a day trip by train to Nikko from Tokyo. We stepped out of Nikko train station and caught a [very crowded] bus just outside. We exited at a Shinkyo bridge, a short ride away. From there, we crossed the street, went up some stone steps and made our way on foot to the temple.

The temple itself is comprised of several different buildings. It's pretty spectacular with its golden accents, carvings, statues, shrines, lanterns and gates, etc. There are lots of stairs and be prepared to take your shoes off to go inside. Also don't miss the 'Crying Dragon Ceiling' room.

We were there in the autumn when the bright leaves added an extra pop of color contrast, so I recommend this time of year.

While in the area, we enjoyed a lunch at the cafe on the walkway up to the temple, we took photos of the Shinkyo bridge and walked to Kammangafuchi Gorge.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Lots of steps, but worth it","We did this as a day trip from Tokyo and enjoyed it. We’ve seen an awful lot of religious sites in our travels and can be a bit jaded . This one, however is up there. Well worth the train journey and the climb up seemingly endless steps. Do it all if you can . Maybe not the inside of the pagoda though. We didn’t. It seemed pointless. It’s beauty is on the outside.","Written April 5, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Well worth the trip to Nikko,"I was not sure of what to expect after having visited the major shrines in Tokyo, but I was amazed. The setting in the forest is stunning and the artistic detail of the shrines made us spend much more time exploring than what we had expected. Well worth the trip from Tokyo!","Written April 4, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,The path to enlightenment,"This incredible shrine and temple complex is full of history, culture and for us even symbolism. We climbed the many stairs on a cold and foggy morning to uncover many treasures of the Edo era and learn about the first shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Surrounded by mystical forests and light rain, we reached the shogun's grave at the peak and immediately the sun lit up all around us, melting the last of the frost. It really did feel like we'd ascended a trail of mystery and returned as wiser and more enlightened people.","Written April 1, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Must do Day trip if visiting Tokyo,"We travelled from Tokyo to Nikko. Took about 2 hours. Stopped at Nikko Train station. Purchased what the local call the “free buss pass” which is free once you purchase the bus pass. Bus pass Cost about 2000 yen each. This took us to the temple and then to Kegan Falls. You will need 8 hours to do Nikko and Fagan falls. Return pass to temple only was just about 300 yen and since the temple is up hill it’s well worth it. All I’ll say is, if you don’t make a trip to Nikko temples, you will be missing out in one of the most beautiful locations in the World. Get up early and go. Trust me on this one! As for Kegan Falls, that in another review.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,amazing temple,"multiple shrines in this compound

big parking area
very good for long walks","Written March 24, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,The most ornate gate in Japan,"Breathtaking scenery and has the remains of Shogun Ieyasu at the top of the mountain, takes 207 steps so be careful if you want to see his undisturbed resting place. The gates and ground are awe inspiring and it also has the see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil monkeys on the stables. The origin of the famous trio. This site is the reason you visit Nikko. And worth every yen. It is a steep entrance cost at 1300 yen per person, but definitely worth it.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Walking Through History,"The Tosho-gu located at Nikko is an amazing collection of fortifications and buildings dedicated and built during the Edo period ruled by the Tokugawa family (Shogunate). You literally stride through history following in the footsteps of samurai & the shoguns. As you walk underneath the Torii gates, marvel at the 5-story pagoda with it's center pole designed to withstand earthquakes (light years ahead of it's time), the Yōmeimon (Gate of Sunlight) that is literally jaw-dropping in it's beauty and intricate detail. Traversing the walkway and stairs (207) that lead to the tomb of Ieyasu Tokugawa, take a moment to look out & realize you are standing in the same spots where samurai once stood guard. To view everything one should plan on spending at least a day & even then you will not see everything. There is considerable walking involved so prepare accordingly with appropriate clothing & footwear, but you will need to slip your shoes off to enter some of the structures. Tosho-gu is not to be missed & cannot wait to return.","Written March 20, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Impressive temple!,This a a big temple with a lot of buildings and a lot of culture behind it. One of the must visit places in Nikko,"Written March 18, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Hilly,The buildings look the same (from the ones in Tokyo) but the terrain is what sets it apart. It's located in a hill and there are a lot of things to see while you climb up. Try to avoid the schoolchildren's tour group.,"Written March 16, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing site,"My husband and i just spent the day at this site. What an incredible experience! I definitely recommend it for anyone who has at least a passing interest in Japanese history. It is well preserved and laid out. The folks who work there do a great job of explaining rhings for those of us who don't speak Japanese. The art works, statuary, and carvings are anazing! The views if the mountains and forest are stunning. The only drawback is that it is not easily accessed by anyone who has any difficulty getting around.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Very interesting museum,The museum has a very good cinema where they tell the story of Lord Tokugawa Leyasu in the form of a cartoon film. The museum itself is quite small but it does have interesting exhibits including items worn and used by Leyasu. Well worth a visit.,"Written March 2, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Wow,A very beautiful place - well worth visiting with a wonderful museum which has a cinema which explains the importance of the shrine and the first Shogun.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Beautiful in winter,"Visited in February after a fresh snow fall the day before so it was beautifully blanketed in fresh powdery snow.

The snow added a magical spell to the whole place.

Occasionally the trees would shed its blanket of snow so one may get covered with snow while walking beneath the trees..",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Mind the map of the place,"Wonderful wooden sculptures and great colours. There are many steps, so watch out. We were there on a day full of school kids that came to practice their English with us. Was sort of funny, didn't really have a silent moment in the place.","Written February 13, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Gorgeous,Late in the day in late January we had the place almost to ourselves. Its impact and beauty cannot be captured by photos. The setting amongst giant Japanese cedar trees towering into the air is monumental and it's truly breathtaking. Be prepared for the cold if you go in winter.

Wear comfortable shoes that are easy to remove so you can enjoy the temple and other areas where shoes cannot be worn. The workmanship of these buildings is amazing. Had a bit of scaffolding and repair work happening while we were there but still great to see.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Visit the Toshogu museum first, for quick historical background","Impressive period architecture and everything was very well preserved. Good combination of Japanese and Chinese elements in many of the structures there, and interesting mix of Shindo (shrine) and Buddhist (temple) in one compound. Photos taking is only allowed in outdoor areas. A worthy place to spend 2 hours walking around before proceeding to other places of attraction in Nikko.","Written January 8, 2019"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Reason of going nikko,It is reason of why we are going to Nikko. Good place and so many to see something. Very interesting,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Must visit in Nikko,"This is the only reason we are there in Nikko.
Must visit although the entrance fee is JPY1300. The whole area is rather big and can spend around 1 hour to visit.","Written December 25, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,The best temples in Japan,"Nikkō Tōshō-gū is a Tōshō-gū Shinto shrine located in Nikkō, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. Together with Futarasan Shrine and Rinnō-ji, it forms the Shrines and Temples of Nikkō UNESCO World Heritage Site, with 42 structures of the shrine included in the nominatio! Wonderful and historic place!","Written December 25, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Expensive, touristy ...","Nikko is extremely touristy. And pricey. There seems to be a charge for entry to every temple and shrine in the place. Of course, this is the most famous. And hence, with an expensive entry fee but yet teeming with people. Yet, it does not seem right to not visit it being the iconic shrine of the area. This place is definitely beautiful, but it is hard to take in the beauty when so many people are jostling you all over. Which is a pity considering that it is a religious place of worship and steeped in history.","Written December 24, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A rip off,"Entrance fee is ¥1,300 per person. The most expensive temple in this so-called world heritage site. And what you get is the tomb and temple of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Nonetheless, the gates and structures of the temple are very impressive indeed with intricate carving details. The size of this temple is large enough, with even royal stable was located inside. To visit the tomb of Tokugawa Ieyasu, you need to take 207 steps uphill. Not recommended for those with faint heart condition.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,I cried (no joke),"There are a lot of shrines and temples in Japan but these are impressive and built in the mountains. I read that there are over 100 building at this temple complex. I'm glad we decided to to stay there for 2 days because it takes a while to see most of it. Saw lots of busses and train travelers on day trips probably from Tokyo, so you time is limited on those tours.","Written November 30, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Mind-boggling,"Nikko can be reached from Tokyo within about two hours (50 minutes to Utsunomiya by Shinkansen, 50 minutes by local JR line). The Tosho-gu is the resting place of Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu whose soul was interred here in the sixteenth century. You walk up a slightly steep slope, pay your admission fee (1300 Yen/adult) and enter the shrine grounds. Here you find the original painting of the three apes (don't hear, don't speak, don't see). Pay close attention to the intricate timber work of the roofs - carpentry at its best. Different buildings show splendour and attention to detail. A good time to visit is late afternoon on a autumn day, when the foliage is particularly striking.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Most impressive,"We took the Tobu line from Asakusa to Nikko. Nikko is a world heritage site founded by the Buddhist monk, Shado Shomin.
Entrance to the shrine is via the Niomon gate. To the left after the entrance are the storehouses and the sacred stable with the famous three wise monkeys carving.
The whole area is massive and there are many steps to negotiate. Very ostentatious gates and pillars throughout
You can visit the Honjido with its dragon ceiling. Many people are crowded into this and the priest gives a demonstration of the dragon ‘roaring’
You can walk to this from the station though buses are available",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Beautiful Temple,"This is one of the most famous temples in Nikko, it is packed with tourists so brace yourself for the crowd! It is stunning and colourfully painted with many intricate details. Worth a visit!",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Big temple area with many easy to miss details.,"There are many things to see at this temple ground. You wont fail to see the carvings of the three monkeys. However, there are a lot more carvings around the temple area. Many of them made from single wood. They look extremely delicate and alive. Take your time to view those pieces as well.
A bit further up the hill of the temple area you will find the cat everyone mentions. It is a small cut out sitting above a door. The door leads stone stairs, that leads to a small tomb. It's a nice walk for those who don't mind to sweat a little bit.
On our way out of the exit we visited the temple with the crying dragon. It was a bit confusing navigating the line, because apparently it was one line for women and the other for men. When we came in there were some explanations in english, but mostly in Japanese. However, the show the priest put on was well worth the time spent waiting(not that long on a week day). The interesting thing about this temple is that there is no echo in there unless you stand at a specific place (at the dragons mouth). The priest demonstrated this by hitting two wooden pieces together at random places and then under the dragons head. When under the head of the dragon, you could hear the echo of the sound of the wooden pieces - the roar of the dragon.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Ancient temple on the hills,This place is packed with tourist and travelers in the weekend. Be sure to come on a weekday instead.,"Written November 16, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Nice Temple with huge crowd,"Nikko Tosho-gu should be one of the best temple in Nikko. However this temple is always packed with visitors despite that you have to pay 1,500 yen entrance fee to see the internal parts of the temple.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,The star attraction in Nikko,"We reached this world famous shrine on foot in about 10 minutes after visiting the Rinnoji Temple. As suspected the place was packed even on a working day. Tickets for visit to the shrine will set you back by 1300 yen which you can also purchase from a machine using credit card. The shrine premise is fairly large and there are plenty of things to see in this wonderful shrine. Luckily only a portion of the roof of the main shrine is covered by construction materials. Before entering the main shrine you will see the 5-storeyed pagoda( although this is free to see, unless you pay the fees and go in you will have no idea about the magnificence of the shrine).The Yomeimon Gate is truly marvellous. You have to walk below the sleeping cat and climb more than 250 odd steps to reach what is called the inner shrine which really is a simple grave of the first shogun. If you do not care for it you need not climb all these steps. Your ticket contains a tab for entrance to the “Crying Dragon” which are paintings on the ceiling of a hall. You have to remove your shoes( you can carry them in a plastic provided or leave behind in pigeon holes though the priest suggested we do the former).Photos are not allowed inside and a priest makes a show of hitting two pieces of wood below the dragon with Japanese commentary. There was a sign saying that English commentary is available. But when I pointed it to the priest he said “ No English”. Photos are also not allowed inside the main shrine. You will need about a hour inside premises. At the exit there is s public toilet. At the end of it you praise the Lord for giving you the opportunity of witnessing such a marvel.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Decent temple,"Spent the day here and it is a very nice temple. 2hrs by train from Tokyo so it’s quite a nice day trip. You can get the bus outside the station to the temple.

One thing to note, in Japan you get on the bus at the back entrance and you exit the bus by the front which is when you pay.

Note the number on the screen on the bus when you get on. It will say your stop number and a price, you pay that as you get off. It’s about 290 yen per person from the station to the temple, so have change on you.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Pretty but busy!,"I visited this temple during Autumn October '18. Lovely large temple complex, however it was extremely busy, even on Thursday and with my partner and I getting there fairly early in the day- 930am. Lots of school kids here.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Magnificent Ancient Japan Temples Shrine,"Starting from the Nikko Shinkyo Bridge, it was about a 15 to 20 minute walk up the steps and a wide mountain trail to the entrance of the Toshu-gu Shrine. As we climbed the mountain, we noticed many redwood trees in the surrounding forests. In the main temple complex, huge redwood trees nearly 4 feet in diameter marked a perimeter area. Definitely a must see attraction when visiting Nikko!","Written November 1, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Festival,"The shrine is an easy walk up from the station but it would pay to get a map from the tourist office as we didn't and had to use our phones to work out where we were - probably means we missed some lovely sights in Nikko.

We lucked out in the timing of our visit and got to see the October festival where the deity is moved from a temporary shrine down the hill back to to his main shrine in a re-enactment of his original interment. The re-enactment is call the parade of the thousand Samurai even though there have only ever been 800!

Very interesting display and there was good English commentary so we had an idea of what we were looking at and their significance.

After the parade and the ceremonies in the temple it was very crowded so we popped to the museum to let things quieten down.

The shrine complex is very ornate and garishly decorated. Got to see the original carvings for the 3 monkeys then climbed the steps to view the more simple tomb of the man himself.","Written October 31, 2018"

It is spectacular.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Stunning complex,"A stunning monument with gilded roofs, stone walls and mossy ground set in a forest of very tall cedar trees. It felt very peaceful despite a huge crowd of visitors. It will be much more enjoyable during the off peak season without the crowd. This site is very much catered to local Japanese tourists so be prepared to see very few signs in English.","Written October 21, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,This is worth the visit but it is a major tourist spot and is very busy.,"As stated it is a major site for tourism. If you like the history of early Japan and visiting shrines, it is one of the best.

The buildings are quite spectacular you can be in awe of the craftmanship.

You are shuffled through a couple of significant buildings, walk past the burial site of the first shogun.

The buildings of which there are many are truly majestic.

It is a site worth visiting.

Possibly not suitable for the very young.","Written October 17, 2018"

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Gorgeous Toshogu,"Yomeimon Gate is my favorite. It is called ""Higurashimon"" that means a day spending gate. One may spend a whole day here while admiring it. Tohoku means that ""the inaction thing over the east"". Tokugawa Clan Shogunate, the 1 st shogunate Ieyasu, is one the most famous samurai leaders in Japan. After he passed away, his grandson made a loyalty wish to Ieyasu. All artisan at that time were immensely famous ones so that gorgeous spectacular gate was made.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Best shrine in Nikko!,"The shrine area is quite large and there's something to discover all around the place. Buy a ticket and explore both the outside and inside of some of the buildings, wear easily removable shoes, and make sure you keep going up to the staired walkway to another section where a monument is kept. In September, the greenery really contrasts the reds and golds of the shrines and it's definitely worth all the walking you do.","Written September 29, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Part of Full Day Must Do,"I will not duplicate what has been said many times before, and with more far more knowledge and eloquence. This World Heritage Site should be on your tour list for Japan, and top of many tourist reasons to visit Nikko.

It rained most of our time here. And it was crowded at times, with many happy school children, and lots of umbrellas, but that only added in some ways to the enjoyment. Must be spectacular in full autumn or with sunshine in quiet day.

Many steps and long pathways, so be prepared for good walks around main compound and surrounding temples, shrines, sights, etc.

Read up before you visit. Makes seeing things clearer.","Written September 28, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Incredible,Both my partner were a little skeptical about the price (¥1300) but it was worth it. The temple is amazing. Define worth a walk around,"Written September 26, 2018"

No photos allowed inside and scaffolding’s are still covering some sections.","Written September 23, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,So Many Stairs but Totally Worth It,"This was a large complex. Much of it is outdoors, but there are two areas where you can go inside if you're willing to take your shoes off. Tickets were checked at the front entrance and the entrance to Hanjido Hall, which housed a roaring dragon ceiling and statues representing each of the animals in the Chinese zodiac. This shrine is probably most famous for the three monkeys of no evil carving, but I particularly liked the sleeping cat carving. Do beware that the sections with stairs, which you will need to ascend in order to visit Tokugawa Ieyasu's grave, are steep and numerous. I heard one woman audibly gasp when turning a corner to see how high they were and saw several kids slip (I was there on a very hot and humid day with several brief rain showers). Bring water, go slow, and be careful. All in all, this was an excellent stop and is not to be missed when in Nikko.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,One of the most memorable parts of our trip.,We spent most of our trip in cities so this was the perfect contrast. It was so nice to see a different landscape! The Nikko-ji Temple grounds were absolutely beautiful. The trees were gigantic and green and full. The stone walkwaysand surroundings through the trees were also gorgeous. The details on the buildings were so intricate and detailed. The whole area allows your mind to wander to another place in time. If you have good shoes and some energy I suggest the walk up to the shrine where the Shogun is buried. It's quite a walk up stone steps but it is beautiful and the burial site is quite surreal. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone visiting Japan.,"Written September 13, 2018"

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Very elegant,"It is overwhelmed by luxurious decoration and elaborate making and size. When I was there, I felt a mysterious feeling as if time has stopped. The shrine that wished for a peaceful world was a very elegant place.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Enchanting place!!,"We made the trip to Nikko on our own and not using any tour. To get there we use the Metro, the JR train and the bus from the station to the temple. We did not have any difficulty to get there.
The place is lovely. It is located on the mountain, between giant trees; you walk and feel the peace and the charm of the place.
The buildings, unlike the other temples we visited in Tokyo, are abundant in details and decorations: flowers, birds, and dragons, which show the talent of the artists who worked on them.
Visitors can see the mausoleum of a Shogun climbing hundreds of steps of a stone staircase, which although it looks very steep, is not fatiguing, and if you need to rest, you can stop and recreate with the landscape.
We went looking for the sculptures of the three wise monkeys and we found with surprise a charming place, which is considered Unesco World Heritage site and I recommend it as a must if you visit Japan.","Written August 13, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Highly recommended world heritage site,"Though a one day round trip from Tokyo, it’s well worth a visit. The trip out is a superb chance to see rural Japan with rice fields and small villages along the way. If you time it right you’ll also see cherry blossoms at their best.
The Toshogu itself is a perfectly restored world heritage site that really does show the best of Edo times artful structures.","Written August 8, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A beautiful UNESCO heritage site that is located very close to the Tobu World Square,"We have visited several Japanese Temples/Shrines in Japan but this one really seemed a bit different and unique.

We observed that there are about 5 structures in this wonderful place including a very beautiful 5 storied Pagoda surrounded by nature all around the site. Also part of the beauty is the row of majestic trees lining the roadway, which is termed as the Cedar Avenue of Nikkō.

However, to go to the main site, one needs to undergo a very steep walk (that involves hundreds of very steep steps) and that is quite an ordeal for people who are not used to regular walks. But I have to admit that even for an avid/daily walker, I found the walk quite a challenge but it was surely worth it.

Once we successfully reached the top and saw the magnificent structures and shrines, all our troubles seemed to have disappeared :).

For us the highlight was ""The stable of the shrine's sacred horses bears a carving of the three wise monkeys, who hear, speak and see no evil ""

The 5 storied Pagoda also caught our attention especially due to its history. Each story of the Pagoda represents the famous five elements i.e. earth, water, fire, wind and aether/Void. We were told by a couple of monks in the shrine that this building was destroyed by fire in the 1600s and was later rebuilt in the early 1800s.

We certainly recommend this beautiful UNESCO site especially to all those tourists who visit the Tobu World Square as the Nikko Tosho-gu is located just 10 kms from it.

Happy Viewing :-)","Written August 8, 2018"

It was pretty chilly in April fortunately that made the climb easier. I'd go back here again. It's beautiful. Don't forget to pick up a charm or two.,"Written July 10, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Shrine to a Shogun,It’s all pretty cool considering this entire place exists to commentate a dead feudal lord from the late 1500’s who is buried here since 1617 atop a forest of ancient trees. A lot of emphasis on the dragon is part of the ritual and attraction. A bit expensive as far as admissions go. Be prepared to remove your shoes a few times.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Worth the trouble to pay a visit from Tokyo,"There are no direct trains on JR from Tokyo, but it was still worth the effort to pay a visit to the world heritage site at Nikko.

It is the most elaborate memorial I have seen in Japan.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Colourful,"Tosho-gu is one of the temples that have a hefty entrance fee as it is more of a museum than a temple. Of course the temple itself is worth visiting with its elaborate decorations and beautiful buildings, but the number of (foreign) visitors and lack of worshippers have turned this sight in a kind of open air museum. It definitively lacked atmosphere, but makes for some colourful pics.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Overwhelmingly Beautiful,"A must visit for any visitor to Japan. All the history, delightful Japanese intricate architecture, culture, history, serenity....all rolled into one. This entire place will set you back as there are multiple entry fees to different sites. But it's all worth while. Take your time and budget sufficient time to soak in the wonders of this place. We spent 1 entire day here. Can't get enough of it.","Written June 18, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Best in Nikko!,"By far the best in Nikko! I guess when you’re one of the most famous leaders in Asian history- you get a good resting place. I have walked up a lot of stairs and seen a lot of old, famous, dead people’s resting place- this one is one of the best! Well kept and easy to navigate through. Don’t miss it!!",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Stunning building, beautiful surrounding scenery","the iconic beautiful astonishing remarkable shrines in Nikko,

the elaborated decoration was so impressive, the charming of manificient surrounding forrest environment has given a magical attractive power and wonderful unforgettable experience.

this place has been preserved and well maintained, and definitely worth for visiting place.","Written June 13, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Largest and most Impressive Temple/shrine,"I would like to point out that after spending the day on this trip from Tokyo there is so much to see around Nikko and a 2-3 days would have been better. The train from Ueno to Utsunomiya then change for Nikko takes around 2hrs and is free with a J-R Railpass. Catching the World heritage bus from Nikko station 500 yen for loop hop on hop off bus,this has got to be the most impressive temple/shrine on the trip . Spread over a large area within the forest ,There are many levels to walk up and investigate some great Japanese history/culture , this is the resting place of one of the great Shoguns to unify Japan.The ornate buildings/shrines statues are wonderfully carved and guilded , i believe this temple gets really busy at weekends ,during the week was quieter. Its a must visit if your in the Nikko area,Don' forget the camera , not an easy climb on all levels there are quite a few steps , but there is plenty to see on the lower levels also .",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Worth It,"While I can't say that I am a fan of the touristy town of Nikko, nor the natural park surroundings which only come into their own after the dry season ends, the temple complex is worth the visit. The details, decorations, layout, and overall feel make this a must see.","Written June 2, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Wrong day to visit,"We accidentally chose the worst day possible to visit this national monument. This is where the first Tokugawa Shogun is buried. The day we chose to visit is during both Taiwan, China and Japan national holiday. The line was crazy, takes about three hours to just step into the temple ground. No photo inside and the mob was just crazy. The friend who went with us did a tour in Japan riding Harley Davidson motorcycle in the past, they ran into barely any tourist at all. Sigh.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A must-see if you are interested in Japanese history.,"This shrine is a must see if you are interested in the history of Japan. Not only is the architecture magnificent (like every other temple and shrine in Japan), but also because it is the final resting place of Tokugawa Ieyasu (although that appears to be a point of contention), one of the three unifiers of Japan. It was absolutely amazing being able to visit the shrine and I am very glad that I was able to witness it when I was in Japan.

Be sure to watch the movie that is played in the nearby museum about Tokugawa Ieyasu, it is an extremely awe inspiring story about his life. The museum also holds some of Ieyasu's possessions which are magnificent to pore over.

If you already know about the history of Japan you must come here to honour the legend that was Tokugawa Ieyasu.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Highlight of Nikko,This is the main spot of Nikko. The ancient temples/shrines are very beautiful and cannot be missed. Also the fact that they surrounded by tall trees on all sides makes it even more beautiful. There are quite a few steps to climb and walk if you wish to visit the entire complex so be ready for it.,"Written May 27, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Very impressive temple,"I think that this place is one of the highlights of Nikko. There are a lot of remarkable spots to visit in the area. All are different from other traditional Japanese temples. In conclusion, it is a must visit place if you go to Nikko.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Impressive resting ground of Tokugawa,"The ground was grand and the surrounding forests and trees towering around the temple feels appropriate for the final resting place of the legendary Tokugawa Ieyesu. There were a lot of visitors, both domestic and overseas, lining up to visit the shrine where Ieyesu lies in rest under the impressive bronze pagoda, which is located in the back of the ground. Other structure and relics were all designated cultural treasures of Japan and well worth a visit.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Wonderful Must-See Shrine in Nikko!,"If you are in Tokyo, I highly recommend taking a short train ride to Nikko (1.5 hours). There are so many things to see and do! Just beautiful!!

My wife and I visited from Canada in May 2018. We walked to Toshogu Shrine from the train station - about 45 minute walk (one way). The shrine has many colourful and decorative structures.

It was quite busy with crowds, so it may be worthwhile to visit during non-peak times. That being said, Nikko is a very popular destination.

I recommend Toshogu shrine very much!!",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Very nice, quite pricy, a lot of people","We were told not to go on the weekend but today we got a lot of guided tours and schools, what makes difficult to visit. The entrance fee is 1300 yens. If you want to visit the other big temple it is 900 yens and you can't get a combined ticket",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing,"Incredible place to visit, lot of temple, beautiful details, lot of people, opened only until 5pm. Need at least 2hours to visit all the temple outside and inside","Written May 4, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Worth the trip !,Definitely a must go place if you visit Japan. It is magnificent series of historical monuments (39!) in a beautiful setting. It is peaceful and inspiring. It does not have the reputation of Kyoto but the main gate “Yomeimon” is second to no monuments in Kyoto and in itself is worth the trip.,"Written April 27, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Fascinating historical site,"This can be a day tour from Tokyo. Train access to this site is very convenient. There is a direct train from Shinjuku to Nikko. If you miss it, there are plenty of options to transfer trains. The local bus to Toshogu runs every 15 min, a day bus ticket costs JPY500.

Recommend to get audio guide at JPY 1000 for 3 sets in order to appreciate the history. Must see are the 3 monkeys, the sleeping cat, the imaginary elephant and the beautiful Yomeimon.

After the visit, one should try the local specialty Yuba (bean curd) at the restaurants near the Nikko station. If you have time enjoy the public onsen at the hotel opposite the Nikko train station for only JPY700 per person.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Must see!,"This is a great one day tour from Tokyo. The tour I took also went to lake Chuzenji and Kegon cascade, all beautiful places but the shrine is the best. The woodwork, different temples, buildings, the dragon call, etc make this probably the most magnificent shrine I saw. The tomb of Shogun Tokugawa is there","Written April 23, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Vacation,"WOW !!, What an amazing palace. The setting is absolutely stunning with all the ceder trees buildings. Some of the best architecture and use of color ever. This place is massive and very crowded. So many perfect picture opportunities everywhere. You need to set aside at least two hours for this site alone. Then probably another three to four hours for the other sites close by, very short walking distance. I so highly recommend this place. Five stars. Great for the entire family or just couple's.","Written April 21, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A beautiful heritage site!,The Toshu-go complex is huge and very interesting! The shrines and temples within are rich in culture. We also climbed the 207 stone steps to the tomb of the shogun high above the shrine which only a few people frequented maybe because it isn't identified well.,"Written April 16, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Fantastic,Well worth the trip out of Tokyo. We were on a tour so only had 90 mins to visit so it was more rushed than we would have liked. The buildings are stunning and there is so much to look at. Would suggest looking at the map and making sure you see the highlights. Worth the climb to the tomb.,"Written April 15, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Nikkō Toshogu Shrine,,"Written April 15, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Simply stunning,"Amazing Shinto Shrine situated a couple of hours from Tokyo and easily reached by rail and then either a short bus ride or 2 km walk from the station (though the rather pretty town). The Shrine is a stunning example, combining Chinese, Thai and Japanese architectural and artistic influences. It is much more ornate than many other Shinto shrines I've visited, with beautiful wood carving, reliefs and painting. Worth spending some time here and slowly wandering through the whole complex - not just rushing up to the three monkeys (and I found the famous sleeping cat rather underwhelming in comparison with everything else here). Some great views and the whole site is surrounded by beautiful forest. Plenty of small restaurants in the nearby town, but not much on site (which is a good thing). The monks showing groups around speak some English, which was helpful. Well worth a visit.","Written April 15, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,THE temple to visit,If you only see one temple in Japan this should be it. Staying overnight inNikko allowed us to be at the temple before any crowds. We didn’t hire audio guides and found there was sufficient information in English around the sights to give us adequate background information. Bring a walking stick if you have mobility issues as there are some stairways without rails. The carvings and colours are beautiful. I think we were lucky that most of the restoration work is almost completed. The entrance ticket included access to all areas.,"Written April 11, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,worth the visit,"We came to Nikko mainly because of the Toshogu. The sumptuous decoration and maintenance done are simply amazing. We were first shocked by the entrance fee - 1300 yen per adult. In hindsight, we know that this price is only a small token in view of the money and efforts to restore and maintain such a beautiful temple.

Absolutely worth the visit.","Written April 9, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Beautiful,Be prepared for lots of walking (and climbing). The place is a very popular tourist spot so theres usually many people there. There are also some small shops selling foods and lucky charms within the area. You can also borrow an audio guide to do a self-guided tour. Overall a pleasant experience.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Amazing place, very touristy",Really good atmosphere here nice buildings and amazing artwork. The forrest is very deep and sacred. Some good hours you can spend visiting. I would normally avoid touristy crowded places but this is worthe a shot despite of the amount of people.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A must see,"At 2100 Yen for museum and shrine it’s not cheap but I think it was worth it . The architectural detailing on the buildings is outstanding.there’s a lot of steps so not suitable for push chairs or people with walking difficulties .
The small museum in nicely laid out with a good dateline for the Tokugawa reign .",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Unfair prices,"Most expensive temple I did so far (and not the most impressive). It is really nice though with all the colors of the temple from the recent renovation (still under renovation at the time I went), but Nikko in general is the first city I did which tries to take advantage of tourism with unfair prices for food, hostel, bus pass and even train (2500¥ for 40 minutes while in other places I paid only 800¥ for the same time...). I hope they change their politics to fit with all the others places of Japan. Not worth the price they ask if you want to do the trip from Tokyo in my opinion.","Written March 27, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,UNESCO heritage site,"If you’re going to come to Nikko this is the place to go. Very touristy (read: lots of people, even on a week day) and also a bit pricey at ¥1300 entry. Also check out the equally impressive Taiyū-in temple nearby.","Written March 27, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Excellent, but go early","This is an absolutely must-see when in Nikko. My husband and I went to the other temples/shrines/mausoleums before going to the big one, probably best to do in that order. Get the English audio guide for ¥500 (we got one between the two of us), it makes the tour more impressive with the information they provide. GO FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. The crowds, particularly the bus tour groups, get ridiculous as the day goes on. We went on a Monday at 11am and it was very busy.","Written March 26, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Great place but too crowded,"It was too crowded to enjoy such a historical place. With a heaving crowd, it was hard to take good pictures of the shrines, without people standing in front of it. Perhaps do a research on when is the best time to visit during off peak season .",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Good point for a day trip,"The unesco world heritage area of Nikko including the various shrines are well worth a day trip from Tokyo. Nikko is reachable by the Tobu line from Asakusa tobu station with a 2-2.5hr journey.
The shrine is reachable by buses outside the Nikko tobu station, short journey.
Entrance fee to the site including the Cat, and 3 monkeys is 1300jpy. The lady manning the entrance ticket sales is quite rude in fact as I enquired if discounted tickets were available for daytrip passes she brusquely said NO very loudly before shutting the window rudely and proceeded to another window to serve Japanese visitors.
Otherwise the inner yard and the old structure is very well preserved however the restored areas look too shiney and plasticky. On a beautiful day this shrine is quite impressive as one can see the carvings and paintings quite clearly.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Great experience,"One of the most important temple in Japan, due to the fact that the one of the most important Shogun was buried here.

The area is full of interesting temples and shrines.
Moreover this place is also famous for the 3 monkeys...",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Beautiful shrine,Beautiful shrine. Lots of walking and climbing. The restored part is amazing in color. The children had a good time. I would recommend taking the audio guide. We did not and certainly missed a lot,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Shrine with spiritual power,"We visited Tosho-gu during one of the coldest season.
The coldness seemed to give even more power to the shrines.

The shrine building has a lot of decoration featuring animals. Not only the famous Three Monkeys and Sleeping Cat, but there are birds and other animals curved into the buildings.

Worth visiting once in a lifetime.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Beautiful and peaceful,"This is an interesting shrine and we took a day trip from Tokyo to visit this shrine and a few others. Renovations to the main gate had just been completed, very shiny and clean and in my view detracts slightly from the expected ""look"" for an ancient shrine. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant experience, we did not feel crowded out although there were many folks visiting at the same time but getting a nice picture was a little difficult. Do take the many steps up to the reputed resting place of the shogun (but this part is not for old folks or very young children). You can take the shuttle bus from the nikko station but please be mindful of the timings in case you need to take the train back to Tokyo on the same day.","Written February 20, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Worth the trip from Tokyo,I traveled three hours from Tokyo to visit the Nikko Tosho-gu shrine and it was so worth it! The most beautiful shrine I've seen in Japan by far. It's full of history and in the mids of picturesque nature. I paid 500 yen for the English audio guide and it was great! Concise and not long dreaded as you can choose which elements you wish to know more about. I'd definitely recommend it to appreciate the place more.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,World heritage site amongst the forest giants,"A remote site nestled amongst Mother Nature demanding respect and solitude. Definitely a place of majesty and awe of old Shogun days.

Well worth the long car trip from Tokyo!",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Needs to be seen In person,"Nikko makes for a great day trip from Tokyo by train. Pictures don't do the shrines and temples justice In the slightest.
I recommend buying the passes that cover all of the shrines as they really are all worth seeing. You will be doing a lot of walking and to see everything will take a while so arrive at a sensible time and allow for this.
Its such a beautiful and historic place to visit.","Written February 4, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,a peak into history,"toshogu shrine is a place one can't miss if visiting Japan, specially one has any remote interest in history & culture

you can reach Nikko easily by car or train, how ever anybody who visiting Japan and have done little research would know that driving is the least expensive mode of transport in Japan if you don't get any traffic tickets, that is.

January sees a moderate snow fall in the area and so it is advisable to be prepared
specially for windy weather.

I would advice to visit the museum first which is right before entering the shrine and watch the video and the movie before you enter shrine so that it is easy and much more relatable to observe shrine.

Management at the place is excellent as most attractions in Japan.

overall a must visit place irrespective of the weather.","Written February 2, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Worth seeing the shogun shrine,"Impressive temple and shrine buildings.
I liked the hall with the roar of the dragon the most.

Worth taking the stairs up to the pagoda.

We visited in march on a Friday but place is still far too busy. Tons of people walking around which clearly impacts atmosphere of the place.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Well worth a couple of hours wandering and exploring,"The shrine / tomb of Tokugawa Ieyasu is well worth a visit. Don't stop at the Rinno-Ji (currently being restored inside a huge 7-story tall shed), but turn left and keep walking up the hill.

The road(?) is wide, and flanked by majestic trees, and when you reach the torii gate, then you've arrived - and your exploration starts. There are too many individual buildings to list them all here - but make sure you see inside the shrine itself, trek up the stone steps to see Tokugawa's surprisingly modest tomb, and breath in the peace and quiet.

On the way back down, turn right and see the temple of the roaring dragon. A clever acoustic trick turns echoes into a piercing shriek that goes right through your head. Don't worry - there is a priest handy to demonstrate how it all works (and damage your hearing in the process).

Stop at the museum and spend half an hour looking at the exhibits, and then stop into the Rinno-Ji on your way out.","Written January 15, 2018"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Large complex with great structures, very crowded","The temple complex is spread out and the structures as well as the surroundings are wonderful. It is extremely popular and crowded, so you don't entirely get to fully appreciate the beauty. We were here during the Nikko Culture week in November, and perhaps that added to the popularity. Overall the complex is great and adds to the allure of Nikko.","Written January 12, 2018"

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Ok,"This was one of the first places we visited on my tour of Japan, I distinctly remember all of the moss covered stone lanterns leading to a pagoda and Torii Gate, the place was insanely busy with tourists and school children everywhere, I think there was a tomb at the top with a stone heron, it was ok.","Written January 3, 2018"

The shrine is the mausoleum of the founder of the shogunate which ruled Japan for more than 250 years. The buildings, which are 17th century, are most ornately carved.

Undoubtedly, the most beautiful temple I visited in Japan. With a lot of sculptures and works of art to admire, simply beautiful! With lots of Japanese history to learn from. This is a visit that you cannot miss if you are in Nikko. The temples are still in function. I recommend visiting it during weekdays, since at weekends, there are long lines to enter and it gets very crowded. A world heritage site, there is a fee for entrance. Highly recommended!",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A beautiful tribute to a shogun. Many stairs involved.,"As I was 5 mths and rather heavily pregnant, the visit to this beautiful shrine was a little tough for me because of the sheer number of stairs we needed to climb.

But the shrine is definitely worth the visit as it is the only one in Japan with 12 buildings lavishly decorated with gold leaf and carvings.

This tribute to the first Shogun of Japan, founded a shogunate that ruled for 250 years. And this was built by his grandson in memory of this powerful man.

I would highly recommend the audio tour as while descriptions of each landmark or feature are brief, it is much better to know what is going on. As it is easy to just get caught up with the crowds and not notice the special features of the palatial place where the shoguns remains have been laid to rest.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Impressive World Heritage Site, but very crowded","Too many people spoil the impression, unfortunately of this most impressive Nikko Tosho-gu.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A must-see for any World Heritage lover,"There are few places on earth where one can hit up 3 World Heritage sites in one day, so Nikko is a contender for the ""super achiever"" award if you`re a Heritage Site junkie.

If you lean more to the Japanophile side, you cannot find a better example of the excesses of the early Edo Shogunate; if you are interested in Shintoism and the veneration of once-living people as gods post-mortem, then you also are in the right place.

Even if you don`t fall into either of the previous categories, Nikko Toshogu is a beautiful place to experience traditional (albeit blinged-out) Japanese architecture, and see firsthand(eye?) some of Japanese most enduring motifs (like the Three Monkeys - hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil.)

There are many structures to explore, but you are almost guaranteed a huge crowd at nearly any time of the day. If you can, avoid Japanese national holiday times and come here on a weekday... maybe it will be less packed! We went on a weekend and it was pretty much one slow moving line through everywhere, and it was hard to take the time to really enjoy the views.","Written November 28, 2017"

Tokugawa Ieyasu, he was the first general of last Samurai era which was continued over 260 years in Japan. He ended Samurai's civilwar, this last Samurai era is called Edo era. Edo means place name which is current Tokyo in Tokugawa's era.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A gem of Nikko,must-see temple in Nikko. It is quite large including the tomb of the General on the hill at the back.Recommended to spend about 2 hours visiting if want to look at the details,"Written October 16, 2017"

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Very interesting!,It was interesting to see this place for its rich culture and history that dates back to the Edo period. It was good that we joined a tour group (Sunrise Tours JTB) as the tour guide was able to explain (in English) the many stories behind this place and why it is often visited.,"Written October 11, 2017"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Nikko UNESCO World Heritage day tour,"This tour was our first one on this vacation. It started early since we had to catch the collecting bus in Shibuya which is a short cab ride from Shinjuku where we were staying. We opted for a cab ride instead of taking the subway because we were a bit intimidated.

The tour started at the JTB bus station amid an atmosphere of organized chaos. Since it was a Sunday, there were tons of tourists scrambling about trying to find their buses and tour guides. The staff appeared to be used to this and were very helpful in shepharding the tourists to their designated boarding stations.

After finally boarding the bus and settlibg in our reserved seats, we were finally able to relax abd enjoy the three hour ride to Nikko. Our tour guide gave us a running commentary of the various places we passed but it took us a while to get used to her accent and beand of humor. Overall, she was informative and thorough in her presentation.

Once in Nikko, we found ourselves in the midst of a sea of tourists that contrasted against the stoic tempkes and shop proprietors. The brochure pictures gave us the impression of serenity but in actuality, we were rubbing shoulder-to-shoulder in a dense crowd positioning for the ideal angles to take the perfect photograph. If you were expecting serenity, think again. But since it was a Sunday, people, from groups of students to group tours, serenity was no where to be found.

Don’t get me wrong. The place has a lot to offer in terms of history and architectural wonders. It was just too crowded. It didn’t help that our tour guide, Kimiko, navigated the crowded path a bit too fast for the our group that staying together was a bit of a challenge.

After leaving the UNESCO World Heritage site, we were treated to a keiseki style lunch which started a bit late because one of the members of our group got lost comibg back to the bus. Since the Japanese are sticklers when it comes to schedules, something had to give - lunch hour was cut short to 45 minutes. A keiseki lunch provides a lot of food and 45 minutes barely gives you enough time to finish.

From Nikko, the tour proceeded to Lake Chuzenji and Kegon Falls. Lake Chuzenji is an alpine lake with crystal clear waters. Kegon Falls was a short ride away and offered great views of the cataract from afar.

The ride back took three hours with a pit stop along the way. By the time we got back to our apartment, we were pooped!

Overall, the tour was informative with interesting man made structures and natural beauty of the Japanes country side. I only wonder if we took the tour during a weekday would make a difference between wading through a crowd like salmon swimming up river or less stressful with thinner crowds.

I recommend taking the tour but not on a Sunday.",

At the entrance, you can see the famous monkeys, speaking no evil, seeing no evil, hearing no evil. Actually I liked the mother and kid monkeys next to those 3 monkeys. I also liked to hear the raring dragon's voice. Only thing that i was not quite pleased, they do not have any explanation in English. I could only catch some words, but still OK. At the major place, I could understand how to pray in Japanese way. He said, bow 2 times first, than 2 times claps, then one more bow.

Recently, some of the national monuments were damaged by a couple of foreigners. By the time the authority traced them, they were out of japan.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Audio guide is mandatory for an authentic experience!!,"Nikko Tosho-gu is located in a remote part in Japan, well north of Tokyo. The shrine itself is grand and magnificent, a 15-20 minute walk from most car parks in Nikko and a necessity if you are lucky enough to be staying in the Japanese countryside. After walking through the forest to Nikko Tosho-gu, the shrine takes approximately 1-1.5 hours to explore in depth, comprised of many gates and magnificent buildings. The entry fee itself is far above the numerous shrines I visited in Japan (1300 Yen), which is very steep, although this cannot be avoided. As there are no English signs at all, I really didn't understand the huge number of foreigners who just strolled around the shrine, as they wouldn't have been able to learn anything about the shrine itself, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, the shogun who the shrine was dedicated to. At 500 Yen, the English audio guide is well informed and I learned so much from it, being able to actually understand the significance of the shrine, and what all the minuscule details about it actually meant. It is a complete necessity to use. For someone who is going to Japan for the first time, this would definitely not be near the top of a list of sights to go to, although more seasoned visitors may want to take a day trip to Nikko, and explore the beautiful town as well as the magnificent shrine itself.","Written August 27, 2017"

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Magical Nikko,"My husband and I visited Nikko in May 2016 on a short day trip from Tokyo. We walked from the station, and while it took roughly 20-30 minutes, it's a lovely walk, aside from the big tour buses passing by. You begin to hear water trickling in hidden pipes by the side of the road, and reaching the bridge was so exciting. We paid to enter the bridge, which wasn't really necessary. Photos of the bridge are really incredible, however.

The shrine itself took our collective breath away. We had read it was one of the most ornate in Japan, and in retrospect, after the rest of our trip, I'd have to agree. The sheer size of it is difficult to render in photos as well. Nestled in the trees and beside rushing water, it's hard to imagine the artisans who created such beauty.

For us, Nikko was a must, and we recommended it to friends who were going shortly after us as well. It was that good.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Top most shrine to visit in Nikko,"Visited Toshogu Shrine during summer in June 2017. Getting here is easy by Nikko World Heritage loop bus from Nikko train station for 500 yen all day. From the bus stop, the shrine can be reached by 5 minute walk uphill. Entrance fee is 1,300 yen.

I must say this Shrine is very beautiful. The decoration is just amazing. Even the wood carvings is very detailed. Spots that you shouldn't miss is the three monkeys and the sleeping cat. Go past the sleeping cat door and walk the stairs up Ieyasu Tokugawa mausoleum.

Toshogu shrine should be on your top most list.",

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing shrine and location,"Starting from the famous red Shinkyo bridge crossing the Daiya river, where everyone competes to get a pic, you can make your way, uphill towards the Tosho-gu shrine. It’s a bit of a hike and plenty of slippery steps but nothing too strenuous unless you’re really out of shape. The shrine itself is well worth the visit, the earlier the better because the crowds can get a bit uncomfortable once the tour coaches arrive. We were staying locally which I would recommend rather than doing just a day trip from Tokyo because there is so much more to see, and some pretty amazing walks if you follow the Daiya river upstream to the Kammangafuchi Gorge.","Written July 12, 2017"

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Longest Journey By Local Trains!,"Wanted to go to Mt Fuji 5th station but was advised against it due to cloudy weather. So did not book a group tour for the next day. The girls at Ikebukuro JR East office suggested not to book any type of outdoor tours due to the rainy season but if weather is good go to Nikko. Could not buy the Nikko All Area Pass at Yen 4,520.00 at Asakusa too late to book online or too early to buy from the office in Asakusa. There's a JR direct train from Ikebukuro to Nikko but one way is Yen3,800. We wanted to go by the cheapest way. That's why we ended going the long long way by local trains. Next day 6.30am we took the train from Ikebukuro station to Akabane. From Akabane to Utsunomiya Station. From Utsunomiya to Nikko station. Finally we arrive at 9.15am I think. Then bought a Yen2,000 return ticket to Chuzenji Onsen.
The road up to Chuzenji Onsen was really winding and have many sharp turns. The bus driver was a real expert slow and steady and I didn't throw up my breakfast.
Anyway around 40 minutes or more we reach the bus stop and walked to the Kegon waterfall.
Spectacular. Wished I could swim in the water at the bottom of the falls. So blue the water!
After the falls, we walked towards Chuzenji lake.
On the way there we ate soft ice cream and had a piece of cheese cake. Just spent less than an hour. Took the bus back to Toshu-go Shrine. A bit of walk up the hill and on the dot noon we reach the walkway entrance to the shrine. We could hear church bells ringing and at the same time the temple gong sounded. It felt really strange hearing this two together like they were talking to each other. The bells kept ringing and the gong kept going a few time. It was mesmerizing watching that person pulling and releasing the tree trunk I think to hit the gong. I don't know if they do this everyday at noon. But try getting there at noon maybe you get to experience this special moment.
Anyway the reason we came to Nikko was of course to see the famous shrine. Really crowded. Hordes of people crowding around the 3 wise monkeys trying to take the best pictures. Really beautiful. Every nook and corners of the shrine you can see amazing delicate cravings. But I feel the best part was the huge and majestic cedar trees lining the walk up to the bronze urn of the Shogun Leyasu
remains. Well worth the long hours spent on the train visiting this magnificent place.
Sorry for the long winded report cos I just could not get over how beautiful the place is and how long the return journey back was by local train.
Warning: not for those with weak necks cos there's no head rest all the way. And you could be standing some parts of the journey.
Plan early and cheaper to buy the pass of course. Even our cheap journey cost us around
Yen7,200 per person return.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"Interesting, but optional","After reading so many reviews with good recommendations, my wife and I included a day in Nikko to visit the temples and walk around for while. At the station we took a taxi to the Tōshō-gū Shrine with a friendly driver for less than 1.000 yen. The temples are ok, but the recent restoration took the ""old-riginality"" of most carvings, paintings and buildings. It looks too fresh. There are many interesting wood carvings and paintings to be found at the different shrine the most photographed ones are the wise monkeys and Nemuri Neko or the sleeping cat but there are others such as the crying dragon and the imagined elephant.
After walking around for while we've decided to walk back to the city. On the way we've stopped at a nice small restaurant, sorry, I do not remember the name.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,A glimpse inside the Japanese heart,"This shrine is a exquisite work of architecture and not to be missed because of its beauty, location and history. It is one of the most original shines in Japan...virtually the same as when it was built. The details of the temple are incredible with thousands of tiny carvings and reliefs. Most impressive is the reverence that the Japanese hold for this site...you FEEL the connection they have to their history here. The shrine plaza is surrounded by ancient giant fir trees (I think) which are reminiscent of the sequoias we know so well in the Sierra Nevada of California. If you take a cab they will deliver you right to the shrine and it's a relatively easy walk up from there. Simply a stunning and very meaningful place, even for casual visitors.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Very busy on the weekend which somewhat ruined the experience.,Fantastic location and area but we just picked the wrong day when it was extremely busy and probably the busiest time (around lunchtime). We caught the train out there to use our JR pass and didn't stay the night as we didn't want to be lugging suitcases but you could easily spend a few days here and it would be great if you timed it better than we did.,"Written June 18, 2017"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Remember where the bus parked,"When you disembark the bus you will follow a path through a wooded area before entering the shrine. At this point stay focused and look for a landmark where to make your turn when you exit. When you enter, the guide will inform you that you will view the shrine at your own pace (see the photos below). When you exit through the tall wooden torii gate you will see a few paths that go through wooded areas to different lots and they all look similar. Remember the landmark when you entered. It rained steady when I was there, looking at others photos it seems the same held true, so be prepared.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Must see in Nikko,This is a great place to visit. There is so much to do here. However please beware there are a lot of steps and lots of walking.,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Best temples seen so far,We actually had only a sketchy idea about the temples of Nikko and arrived on a dead day in town . Considered cutting the day short as we couldn't see much of interest. Decided to walk up to the top of the hill and came across a beautiful red bridge and crossed the road to see what was up the stone path... Awesome is how I'd describe the rest of the day. No crowds and the most lovely and interesting collection of shrines we'd seen. And i had been feeling a bit templed-out by this time.

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Awesome!,"During our planning for this trip to Japan, we did not include Nikko Toshogu Shrine until a friend told us about it. We decided to do a day trip from Tokyo and we were glad we did although it was 2-hours away by shinkansen, a change of train at Utsunomiya and a bus ride from the station to the shrine.

Toshogu Shrine was simply awesome. There was so much to see including the famed ""see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil"" monkeys on the facade of a building, the sleeping cat...the list goes on. What was really amazing was this room where you hear the ""crying dragon"". The priest hit two sticks together and only at a certain spot in the room, the sound echoed like a someone in grief. Anywhere out of this spot, you hear the sound of two sticks being struck together.

If you are making a day trip from Tokyo, you may want to either take a heavy breakfast or have lunch before heading for the shrine because there is no cafe or restaurant there. We didn't know that so we had a late lunch at Utsunomiya where we had to change train back to Tokyo. But it was a blessing in disguise because Utsunomiya is famous for its gyoza. We ate at the famed Higashiguch Utsunomiya. It is a small pink standalone building with large windows across the road from the station. You may want to try the inexpensive gyozas too.

BUT if you're patient and have lightning reflexes, you WILL still be able to find gaps in the crowd to take photos of the Torii, Youmeimon and other spots without any photobombers. For this, you'll need to keep your cameras at the ready. (It also helps if you have a fast cameraphone.)

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,"A ""must see"" world heritage site that is an easy day trip from Tokyo","Most of the buildings in this complex/park have been renovated and are sparkling with original colors. We had no trouble with crowds and were able to see most of the park in 4 hours although I think it is best to view it in a leisurely day walk. The main building is still under reconstruction and is totally covered with an outside shell. That said, they have done a great job allowing visitors inside to see the renovation in process. Much has already been completed and they have shown the details of the renovation in displays and view of the actual work. They started in 2006 with plans to finish in 2020 so almost finished.

The God stables with the monkey carvings were enchanting and fun to see the original ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" monkeys who are the guardians of horses. The various gates have magnificent statues, brilliantly colored, guarding the entrances.

There is no reason to book an expensive ""tour"" to see this site as it is easy to get to on JR line and with a Lonely Planet or Eyewitness travel guide, you can do it yourself at your own pace.","Written May 18, 2017"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Renovated,"The shrine and nearly all buildings at the site have been extensively renovated. They now shine and glitter in gold and vibrant colours. Whilst this shows them off in all their glory, we felt it also took away some of the ""historic feel"" - they may as well be in plastic, rather than what they are, beautifully carved timber.
The day we went, the site was packed and there were long queues all over the place. It's a little hard to enjoy the serenity when surrounded by thousands, all clicking their cameras frantically.
I don't know if this is a permanent display, but on the day there was a exquisite collection of bonsai trees on show. Combination of these trees with the backdrop of the shrine make for great pictures.
I would imagine how stunning it must be if you can visit it on a quiet day, even better, covered in snow.",

You can take a train from Tokyo to Nikko - change after 50 mins then another 40 min on Nikko Express . However there was a 40 min gap between trains so had time for lunch .
Start out early as main attraction closes at 17 00 hours .

So a long day !

Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Best Temple visit,"On our 3rd tour of Japan, we have visited many shrines and temples, but this is our favorite. Still undergoing renovation and very crowded, the statues, carvings, ceilings et al are spectacular, all set in a lovely old cedar forest. The only downside is the number of stone steps to climb to reach all levels - but well worth the effort.","Written April 27, 2017"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Wow- highlight of visiting Japan,"Yes, it is worth a day trip from Tokyo! The bullet train takes you to the transfer station and the signs are well marked, you can do this.

The tourist information office in Nikko will set you up with a bus ticket, there is loop through town so you ride for 10 minutes to the temple complex.

The whole temple complex was impressive! The scale, level of detail and colors- wow!
The pagoda is right in front of Tosho-gu (main complex), Taiyun-in (buddist temple) and Shinkyo bridge are unique and you won't forget them. The pictures do not do this place justice- I mean it! It was not crowded and very peaceful.
I went in the winter while it was snowing and it was incredible- like a movie.
Just go and spend the day- the temple close at 4pm and you don't want to miss out.
There is a reason this is a Unesco heritage site.","Written April 26, 2017"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Amazing but still some parts were under repairment,"It was not my first time to visit Nikko Tosho-gu, but it was great to visit this shrine again.
This time, I got the explanation kit to know the detail of things which gave us a lot of information. If you climb up the mountain, it might be good but to steep for aged people.
Beautiful and very different ones from Kyoto, Kamakura or other city in Japan.

We went there by Special Express train of Tobu Asakusa line. Got off at Nikko Station.
You can take one day bus ticket and the bus brought us near Tosho-gu.

April was the very good season, because you can also see some cherry blossoms there.","Written April 26, 2017"
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Fabulous,Arrived in March with our guide being ecstatic that the gate which had been covered for restoration work for 4 years was now uncovered. Also we had the added bonus of an overnight downfall of snow. What an atmosphere with the walk up to the Shrine through all the trees. Didn't know much about the shrine but so worth the 2 hour journey to get to it. The town also looked interesting but we didn't have time to explore sadly,
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Big Shrine,"When we arrived at the main gate of Nikko Tosho-gu, we were greeted by five stories pagoda which was claimed to have the same height as the Tokyo Skytree Tower. We needs to pay an entrance fee if I'm not mistaken is about 1.200 yen. It's actually expensive compared to other common entrance fee of a shrine. But as expected, it was expensive because the place was spacious. The ornaments on the wall were impressive. You need to take a lot of steps to reach the top. As good as it is, for me I don't find there was much to do or see inside.",
Japan,Nikko Tosho-gu,Extraordinary - and very impressive,"Travelers to Japan should visit this site. You can feel the atmosphere from the old days, and you would almost expect to see samurais around the corners. Don't miss out the trip to the Nikko Shrines",

Japan,Shurijo Castle,"Although many structures are no longer there, still worth a visit!","Yes, the main buildings at Shurijo Castle have burnt down and there are efforts to clean the area up and start construction again. Although most buildings are no longer here, I feel the castle area is worth a visit. The walls are still in tact as are some structures. It will be many years before the project is complete. This castle has burnt down many times and has rebuilt so it will be fascinating again once it's up and running. You can still walk the grounds although a lot of places are currently blocked off. There are a lot of historic markers worth reading, I learned a lot. After visiting the castle, I walked the park across from it and explored the surrounding area.

Again you must visit Shurijo castle while In Okinawa.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Nothing much to see as the main area was burnt down,"The main part of the castle was burnt down in a fire last year, and it will probably take some time before everything is back up again. For now, it was mainly the outer walls which are available for viewing and the garden area within the castle. Nothing really much to experience, but at least it was completely free at the moment. Not many signage or brochures to explain about the fire or history of the place, which was a let-down.

The castle restaurant was open, and provided pretty good value for money food, although the food wasn’t anything to wow at. Service was pretty fast, and food was quickly served almost instantaneously after ordering.","Written March 7, 2020"

Japan,Shurijo Castle,After the Fire,"Shuri Castle in Shuri, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Between 1429 and 1879, it was the palace of the Ryukyu Kingdom, before becoming largely neglected. In 1945, during the Battle of Okinawa, it was almost completely destroyed. After the war, the castle was re-purposed as a university campus. Beginning in 1992, the central citadel and walls were largely reconstructed on the original site based on historical records, photographs, and memory. On the morning of 31 October 2019, the main courtyard structures of the castle were again destroyed in a fire. We saw the castle in a ruined state but hopefully when restored, I will see it at it's beauty.",

Japan,Shurijo Castle,I hope it can be rebuilt soon,I hope Japanese government is able to get this place rebuilt soon. It is really sad to see this place being destroyed like this.,
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Most Parts Open & Free. Go visit.,"It's 110% worthwhile to visit the castle ground now, although the main castle is burned down. It was painful to see the damage, but in a big picture, this is one example of how history evolves. I believe it was meaningful for our kids to see the site as well.

It's completely free (though you do need to pay parking, if you are driving), and all the shops and the restaurant are open.

From a purely logistic standpoint, you have less crowd to fight through. There usually is a line to get dressed in the traditional Okinawan costume to get your picture taken at Shurei Mon (the famous gate that appears on 2000 yen bills), but there was no line when we visited. I think the cost was about 1000 yen per person, if I remember correctly. Shurei Mon is located at the beginning of the route, away from the fire-damaged area. Also, you actually get to appreciate the rest of the castle ground (greens, gates, etc) better.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,An amazing castle,"We were told this was a must do on our list of places to go in my husbands heritage country and we were not disappointed!
This is an amazing castle with an extraordinary story. There is so much culture and history in this place. We thought it was so crazy that they rebuilt this castle twice after fires destroyed it and they have clear floors in certain areas to show the remains.
After returning home to the states a week later, we learned that it burned down again. This brought tears to our eyes! So glad we got to see it and hope they rebuild it again!",

It’s still possible to visit the site. There’s no charge to enter the site. The guides are still there to help you.
But what’s left is broken tiles, burned timbers, and ashes. I cried.
I visited Shurijo Castle 30 years ago, just after it was reopened following a major restoration. This year, it was again being refurbished and restored when the fire occurred.
The Japanese will rebuild it. Until then, if you’re in Okinawa and don’t mind the sadness of seeing the destruction of this castle, go to Shurijo Castle. While you’re there, leave a donation to assist in the reconstruction.",

Japan,Shurijo Castle,This was a very special place to visit.,"This used to be a very special place to visit, I cried and my heart hurt when I heard about the Castle burning down, right after the Notre Dame in Paris burnt down. What a lost to the world community. But I know that it will be restored once again for the third or fourth time during it's existance. I visited it in the 1960'sm the 1980's and finally in 2002 with my wife. Ever time I visited the Castle it had had some improvements made to it. Over time there were many historic artifacts included in the restoration. Some will be able to be replaced or duplicated due to the many pictures of the Castle that exist. And thank god that there are other artifacts in the many museums around the island. It will take many years to get it back to what it looked like in 2002 when I last visited. I was a student of Dr. Barbara Golden, who received her PHd in the history of the Ryukyuian island culture by the University of the Ryukyus. Many of the things she discovered over the 35+ years on the islands, were either kept in the Castle, at the University of the Ryukyus, or in one of the many museums affiliated with the University. She was the author of several Japanese books on the history and on the different cultures in the Ryukyuian chain of islands. One of her books, I believe was on the 27 different castles on Okinawa when there were 27 kingdoms there. I would like to visit the castle one more time before I die.","Written December 16, 2019"

I believe the American Air Force destroyed this place once before, and it was resilient enough to come back then, so I'm sure it will again.",

Limited information is provided but it is enough. There is a good amount of stairs involved to see everything. You can also walk the ramparts. At the main gate, you can dress up in traditional costumes for a fee and get your photo taken. After you are done, take the short walk to the family mausoleum. It is a separate smaller fee and takes about 15 minutes to see. Watch you head 😁",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,parts still open,"We came here on our last day in Okinawa. The undercover parking was 380yen which was very conveniently located. The castle itself has paid and non paid areas. The non pain areas still have some interesting things to look at and lots of information signs in different languages. The paid section was 830yen and the signs stated that there was a discount if you had a monorail day pass. The restored castle is partly a museum with real and reproduced relics. You get to walk inside the restored wooden castle where they have installed modern elements such as wheelchair lifts and handrails. In typical Japanese style there is a stamp rally throughout the castle and if you complete all the stamps, you collect a small gift. Overall it was a beautiful castle with a great view from the wall. Although it's not an authentic experience it was still quite interesting.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Educational Historical Site,"Second time i came. We took a map of the site and stamp each building we visited.

It was just a fun way to ensure we do not miss out any site. We took 2.5 hours including lunch at the tourist center, there is a restaurant on level 2.
It is historical journey. So read up before you visit.

We had a picnic at a rest stop. There is a sheltered area with beverage vending machines. We had wanted to sit by the pond but due to rain, we decided to just have the picnic under this sheltered rest stop.It was fun.

You can take a train direct to the castle but this time we took a taxi. Less than 2000 yen.

We were able to pick up some souvenir there as well.",

There is a banner and a poster outside the office. The castle grounds are huge and it's really too hot to walk outside for too long today.

We took bus 9 from Naha Station or you could also take the monorail and alight at Shuri Station. There is entrance ticket that costs about 870 Yen and it is very worth it. It is perfect to visit the castle just before the sunset for a perfect viewing and sunset photo. The main entrance stands Shureimon Gate that leads to the castle park. As you walk by to your right passing the Gusuku (fortress) stands at the top of the hill is the castle's main hall or Seiden. The Una Plaza stands in front of the seiden which serves as ceremonial hall. Inside the castle you could view the main throne and several rooms which truly embodies its Ryukyuan interior design. Outside as you walk there is the observatory called Iri No Azana, which has a 360 degree view of Naha and bird's eye view of the castle complex which is truly amazing and beautiful. Here we took the best sunset shots and videos which are truly remarkable. It is also not that very high to climb up perhaps around 20 to 30 steps only. The castle at sunset is truly historical and romantic and it is not very crowded with tourists.

Let me explain. Upon entering the castle proper via the “usual route” (Tip for you fellas out there- don’t make the joke that ‘this is how I refer to you as sometimes honey’ to your wife- she will not talk to for hours) you are asked to take your shoes off and keep them with you in a plastic bag. You go about the beautiful red, adorned and tatami strewn castle which houses an enormous throne which the missus and I hypothesize was needed as most of the Ryuku emperors were probably as obese as Mr. Kinjo (Okinawans and travelers will understand) and then at the end you put your shoes back on and hand the plastic bag to a man who straightens the bag out for cleaning and then reuse. HE MUST BE THE ONLY MAN ON THE PLANET THAT USES ATHLETE’S FOOT ON HIS HANDS!

Japan,Shurijo Castle,looked great,"went here as part of a shore tour, the castle looked great and seemed to have lots of interesting things to look at the grounds and gardens also looked very interesting. unfortunately we were only allowed a very limited time here so seemed to be rushed through with no time to stop and look. there were some steep steps to access the main area and you are required to remove your shoes in one of the areas. Personally think it would be a great place to visit and send the day, but for us unfortunately that was not allowed.",

Very organised and clearly marked route so you can see all that is on offer.

The ‘Stamp Rally’ where you take a stamp sheet and use an ink stamp to stamp landmarks along the route is a genius way to get kids (and adults!) engaged and motivated during the sight seeing. Get all stamps to receive cute stickers and a mini folder at the end.

Much of the outer grounds is free, and the inside of the buildings require an entrance fee (¥800). Good views of the city.

The tea set in the building was a lovely break. For ¥310 you get jasmine tea and 4 imperial cookies, served in the tatami room where the prince used to entertain diplomats and guests. The staff are dressed in red kimonos and explain the snacks.

Being an European, our castles are something completely different and this was like a refreshing breeze. The castle itself did not have too many old items but it was more like the building itself where the tour focused.
We visited the castle on a sunny day and as some areas are outdoors, this was the right day. The only minor disadvantage were big tourist groups as sometimes it felt there was too much people.

We could see meticulous work done to restore the castle which was damaged in battle of Okinawa. It may take 1-2 hours. Great place to visit!!,
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Replica But Still Interesting,We visited this beautiful castle and grounds and pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and layout of the castle. The original castle was destroyed by the U.S. during WW2 when the Japanese were headquartered here. Only the walls remained.

Japan,Shurijo Castle,On your own from Naha cruise port,"If you are sufficiently confident to travel a few stops on the monorail and enjoy plenty walking, you can spend a lovely few hours seeing this area and visiting the castle on your own. We had originally booked a ship tour which was cancelled and so at fairly short notice decided to sort something ourselves.

The attached map photo shows the port (circled in pink) and the monorail line which travels via Furujima and on to Shurijo.

We disembarked the ship first thing and walked directly up to the monorail station, Kencho-Mae, crossing 2 or 3 road junctions (bottom left box). We purchased a day pass (inexpensive) and on arrival at Shurijo station, followed the directions to the castle, which obviously includes some uphill. We felt that this castle was sufficiently different to others seen on our cruise/tour to be worthwhile. If you can get there early (before the tour buses) it is rather nice and whilst in reality there was little to see inside, some artefacts and history (no photography allowed), the main Hall was certainly photogenic from outside. Nominal fee for entry.

We then walked back to the monorail and disembarked at an earlier stop, for Makishi, enabling us to experience the market and surrounding streets. The fish market was very interesting, as were some of the pottery stalls and the expensive liqueur with a viper in the jar! We stopped for coffee at the black sugar stall and continued this route back to the ship. Enroute and very close the ship is also the Naminoue Shrine and gardens and understand from others who didn’t venture too far on their own, that these were also very pleasant.
Enough to see and do here for a few hours and has a different feel to other Japanese ports.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,A disappointment!,"I think I built up my expectations of the castle because the surrounding park area is so very beautiful. As we entered the paid part of the museum (Y820) we removed our shoes and put them in the plastic bag they handed us at the door. The castle has been totally renovated and is, for the most part, barren of any kind of furniture other than a throne. There was a display of stringed instruments and a very few decorative paintings, but other than that there was little to see on our self-guided walk. On my next visit I will save my entrance fee and just absorb the beauty of the surrounding park grounds.","Written March 27, 2019"
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Colourful and stylish 'Seiden'!,"Whilst there are many free-to-view cultural assets to see on the climb up to Shurijo Castle, entry to the 'Paid Admission Zone' of the Castle itself costs Y820. If you travelled to Shuri on the Monorail using a 1-Day or 2-Day Pass, you can get a significant reduction (c. 20%) to Y660, on production of the Pass. Entry to this Zone gives you access to the red and white paved quadrangle where you can view the colourful and stylish 'Seiden' - the centrepiece of the Shurijo Castle structures, and to a self-guided tour internally of the rooms.
Dating back to the 14th Century, the brilliant colours and distinctive Ryukyuan architecture shows both Chinese and Japanese influences. Left in ruins after the Battle of Okinawa, the Castle was totally rebuilt/restored based on an 18th Century model. As much as I admired the vermillion and gilded opulence and polished wood interiors, there are some 'cons', including;
- even on a dull and overcast mid-week January day, the #1 attraction in Naha seems to attracts hordes of visitors,
- as a senior travelling solo, I tend rely on my camera to record my travels and the enforcement of 'no photography' rules (internally) denies me of these memories.
Notwithstanding these, .... Would I go back again on a future visit? I certainly would!",

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Parking very difficult,"If you manage to find parking at the main entrance , walk to entry of castle is about 100m . Otherwise if the carparks were full ( we reached around 330 pm) then you have to park behind the castle in the many little carpark scattered all around . We paid 500 yen for two hours parking at a private residence .
What is worse , to access the castle, we had to walk about 100m up a steep slope , then 100m on flat ground , then skirted the castle wall walking up and down stairs. By the time we reached the exit point of the attraction , we were all winded . You had to walk another 100 m on flat ground to get to the entrance .
To me , if there is no parking at the front of the castle , forget about this attraction or go another time especially if you have strollers and elderly with you.","Written March 13, 2019"

It’ll cost you 820¥ to enter to the castle to learn more historical information. But you will need to read the information yourself, else you can always hire a guide to do the job for u.
The map of the castle can be collected at the ticketing counter. Through the map, you should covered all the main stations, places u need to see, to know about the castle. On top of it, you will collect a castle souvenir; which is a sticker & a paper folder once u’ve collected all the 25 + 3 stamps at stops number 25.

Free entry to the park/grounds but had to pay 800 Y to enter the castle. Free for disabled and one companion. It was very crowded inside the castle. Felt like a herd of cattle being pushed through the line but glad we got in at least to see the throne. Very Chinese, if you ask me. Wish we had more time there to see the rest of the park. Hopefully, will return someday.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Reconstructed History,"The original Castle was completely destroyed during WWII. What we see today is a reconstruction based on photographs and available plans.

Getting to the Castle area is no easy task as you must walk an uphill path and a number of stairs. This is the Path to the Seiden where you will see a number of gates. The wheelchair path misses the sites along the path.

The Museum tour is basically self guided. You must remove your shoes (you are given a bag to carry them) to walk through the halls. As my wife has orthopedic boots she declined the tour. Walking on bare feet would be too painful. The Ryukyu exhibits were somewhat on the sparse side. The staff were all dressed in period costume.

There is no air conditioning inside the museum and it was very hot. There are free hand fans to keep cool. During our visit there were large crowds. The tour finishes on the second floor. We spent the last 15 minutes in a mass crowd as we funneled onto a staircase and the exit where people are putting their footwear back on. Staff collect the bags for recycling.",

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Beautiful surroundings!,"Shurijo Castle is about 20mins away from Kokusai Street. We decided to take a taxi instead since it was not very convenient go there by public transport. The entire compound is quite huge. If you are keen to participate in the stamp rally (where you can get a souvenir if you complete a number of stations), I would recommend at least 1.5 hours. We managed to get a sticker souvenir for completing the minimum number of stations. The castle was partially under renovation as at Nov 2018.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,It’s a beautiful walk to the castle,"Better than I expected. We were late and missed their last performance at 4pm. The walk into the park is free unless you want to enter inside the castle.
Had the benefit of both day and night view.
Have some steep steps n slopes too.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Nothing much to see inside castle,"Exterior surroundings of castle is beautiful but inside the castle, modern design and nothing much to see except room after room.

Only few historical stuffs on display.

Need to carry own shoe in a plastic bag when inside castle.

Outside castle can have a nice view of Okinawa city.",

Nice views from the very top. Helpful staff, well worth a visit while visiting the seaport.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Wonderful site and guide,"This is a must see place for sure, we were lucky to have a really good guide who spoke perfect English and had a clear understanding of the history of the site. One thing to remember is wear easy to remove shoes as you need to take your shoes off to enter the Castle site. Although so much is reconstructed there are a few areas that have original foundations these can be seen through a glass viewing point. Staff in the area are dress in national costumes and they were happy to stand and pose for photographs with guests of on their own. There is a peaceful calm around the place until you get into the gift shop which is bustling, here you can use US dollars as well as Yen to make your purchases. There is a nice walk through to the castle and well worth a couple of hours. Suitable for people of all ages as there is so much to see.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Castle Park,You have to watch your route. Then you will find the way back easy! The outside of the castle is in reconstruction. Therefore no good pictures were possible to take. The park is nice and once can do a relax walk.,"Written December 4, 2018"
Japan,Shurijo Castle,It is worth the time and the climb to visit,"I took my public transportation there. As a tip the castle is situated on top of a hill. We took a taxi there but walked down hill to Gibo station after the visit. A climb uphill would have been very challenging.

A large section of the attraction is free. And there is a game to collect stamps at different parts of the castle. This is very useful to get my son to walk around with us as he wants to collect all the stamps.

I really like the staff at the attraction. Really tried to be helpful.

Although the original castle is destroyed they try as much as possible to restore it using historical records.

Know a lot about Okinawa history from the visit.","Written December 1, 2018"
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Worth a visit,"The entire place is well organized. Inside the palace, there is a path that you just have to follow to tour the entire palace. The palace is orderly and clean, we have to take off our shoes (so be sure to wear socks with no holes!) There is a small dessert shop inside, where you can try their traditional desserts",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Untimely Visit,"Castle frontage was undergoing repair works. Knew about it after paying the 820Yen entrance fees and going into the castle grounds. Otherwise, it was about a 30mins tour. Tick in the box!",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,A place to hang out when you have extra time,"Stayed at Naha for 2 to 3 days before I headed to north, this place seems worth to go when I looked up in the internet where to go in Naha.
Anyway, if you are not into history this is not your cup of tea. The garden and view are ok but I would not say amazing.
But they do have a trick to attract people (in Japan culture), it is the stamp collection. For each signature spots or places they want you to visit (a bit like ikea, try to guide you to walk through the place), there has stamp station for you to stamp onto the leaflet and you can collect all or not (can have souvenir). And I quite obsessed into collect things personally so I sucked into it, and spent 1 to 2 hours to walk around to collect all.
They also has pay and free areas, pay area I would say not much to see tbh. I don't recommend that but you are like me, want to collect all stamps then you need to pay money to go in.
can get discount (JPY820 originally) if you show 1 or 2 days monorail pass.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Do the scavenger hunt for stamps!,"We arrived here by car and were immediately guided to our parking spot by multiple traffic attendants. As soon as you go up via the escalators, you enter the park. The building where you exit has multiple information desks and stands where you could get your information and pamphlet for the scavenger hunt for stamps. When you've completed the scavenger hunt, you'll even get extra free stickers as reward.

Surprised by this little activity, we scoured the area. The park was well maintained, and we particularly enjoyed the view from the observation deck. As we got something to drink from the machine in one of the little houses, a nice lady also informed us that ""in two minutes"" a performance would start at the outside of the area, and it would be nice for us to see. She was right, and we enjoyed the two traditional dances performed by people in traditional costume and make-up.
After the dance we entered the castle, where we were welcomed by a large but tidy courtyard. Unfortunately the front side of the castle was under restoration, but they did put a banner with a picture of the castle (which was quite humorous to me). On the inside, we had to take off our shoes (they provided us with a plastic bag) and toured the many historical goods. Further into the castle, we even had tea and snacks in the tea area. This was particularly enjoyable, as you had a fantastic view on the back garden while snacking on some nice sweets with Jasmin tea. After the tea, we continued scouring the castle and visited the grounds. In the park there was additionally a visitor questionnaire, where we were asked to answer a few questions in return for a post card of the castle. This showed me the were continuously working on improving the castle grounds on accessibility and guidance for visitors.","Written November 14, 2018"
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Nothing much,Maybe I am not a so history type of person😂 I think it is not so worth the entrance fee. I should have walk the outside instead.,"Written November 14, 2018"
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Lovely replica,"The route is from the Mashiki Station.
Take the monorail to Shuri station or you can also go to Gibo Station as well (the stop before Shuri and might be easier to get to the castle from Gibo). Which is a twelve minute monorail ride. From Gibo station you head straight south for around a ten to fifteen minute walk. From Shuri station it will be just a little longer and you have to head south/ west. Also harder to get to the castle, because the streets to get there, is more difficult. Also Google maps was having a problem on the route to getting us there.

When you get to your destination, there will be a few vendors selling ice cream and other trinkets, on the grounds. This is in the middle of the observation area on one side, and a pathway on the other, which takes you to the castle.
Check out the observation area first. Really great views and you can even get a nice selfie, with Shurijo Castle in your background.

It costs you maybe ten to twelve dollars to get into the castle grounds and the castle.
The grounds are immaculate, the architecture is incredible, and it is such a great place to see a part of history.

If you like castles and you're in Naha, then you should check this place out.
Very great experience and I enjoyed it very much.",

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Worth the walk,"Having visited castles in many countries, this one was a little unexpected to see at first as it was not unlike the buildings we saw in Beijings forbidden city. Yes there are huge walls around it, and it can be a bit of an uphill climb with all those steps through the various gates, but it does have a lot to offer you in Japanese style architecture.
Sadly the original building was blown to bits during WW2, but they have done a fabulous job of recreating the original. Except on our visit, they were still doing a bit of construction work, so maybe the outside was not at its best.
Then it was off with the shoes as we padded through various levels of what a life would have been like in the Seiden .Lots of artwork to see, but photography on some levels is not allowed. However the throne room of the Ryukyu royal family is allowed, and it is impressive with a massive throne on display fit for a king- which it was originally. The rest of the rooms seem a little spartan by modern standards.
There are other buildings to see , but rain did not help us much that day. There is a gift shop in the adjoining Hokuden building (and toilets too) and some exhibitions of local history.
The coach stop building also has souvenir shops, and a cafe up top to recover in should you need it.","Written September 2, 2018"

We were only about a 5-10 minute drive away from our hotel. Finding reasonably priced parking in the area is a bit tricky. From memory it was about 500 yen for about 60 minutes or something and then you add on more per hour. We luckily found a place that was much cheaper for about 500 for 2.5 hours so watch for small private parking options rather than going with the big parking chains. 2.5 -3 hours should be pretty sufficient to check out this place.","Written August 19, 2018"

The Castle served as the centre of Ryukyu Kingdom and its politics, foreign affairs and culture. Okinawa was an independent country, before being annexed by Japan in 1879. Recent World War 2 history saw the castle and just about everything on Okinawa blown to hell and over two thirds of its population wiped out. Every building in Okinawa is new. This castle is an amazing reproduction. A visit to the castle teaches about the kingdom and the Kings who governed it during a particular period of history. Entry cost is reasonable, as it has been made a world heritage site. You will need to remove your shoes and carry them in a bag, while you walk through the reconstructed interior parts of the castle. This will preserve the wooden surfaces for future generations. I loved the battlements and seeing their layout and the fact that the castle is built on the top of a steep hill, shows the invincability of the Kingdom. A visit is highly recommended.",

We caught the monorail from the shuttle bus drop off point, (a day pass for the monorail was Y800) and the castle was at the final stop. There was very little signposting but we could see where we were heading and we eventually found our way although it took us about 15 to 20 minutes.

The outer parts of the castle and the grounds are free to enter; there is a gift shop, small restaurant and public toilets adjacent to the car park. The toilets are western type (thank goodness!) with extra buttons for douche, dry and music - very civilised!!

We climbed upwards to the main part of the castle, it was a steep path with some steps but there was a disabled access available. We paid Y660 entry fee for the castle which was a one way circuit around the exhibits and included videos, reconstructed rooms and some models.There was also a Japanese tea room and we had unlimited jasmine tea with 5 small cakes for Y300. We sat at a communal table and one of the waitresses gave a talk about the food and drink we were enjoying - there was an English translation in the menu which was a great help!

You have to remove your shoes before entering the castle, just as you would in any Japanese home so its a good idea to either take slippers or wear socks - I had to pad around in my bare feet and felt a bit uncomfortable. There are lockers for your shoes and other belongings in the tea house, otherwise you just carry your shoes around with you in the provided plastic bag. The castle gardens are worth a visit too, with lots of fruit trees

This was a great experience, we were there for almost 3 hours and had an excellent time!",

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Enjoyable Place to Visit,"Shuri Castle is enjoyable to visit. The old stone walls and temples around the castle are particularly photogenic. The castle itself has been heavily restored. There is currently scaffolding around the main hall. It has a distinctive red paint job that does not make it look authentic. Inside there are replicas of the bowls and armour used in the old times.
The grounds are well kept. It is worthwhile getting the stamp map and going around collecting all of the stamps. Kids and some adults will love it. 800 JPY for an adult to enter. There are toilets and plenty of vending machines with water because it can be quite exhausting walking around in the heat. The castle is also easily accessible by wheelchair.
While it isn't as grand as many other forts in the world, Shuri Castle is certainly worth spending a couple of hours wandering around.","Written June 8, 2018"

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Did not live up to expectations,"I was extremely excited about visiting Shuri Castle. It's in Japan, but used to belong to a royal family that presided over its own independent kingdom (Ryukyu), so it felt like I was going somewhere really ancient and unique.
But it's not ancient, not really. Because the castle is a reconstruction and this was the feeling you got when you went inside the main hall.

I found the exterior relatively impressive (the architecture resembles Chinese architecture). The red striped courtyard is a sight to see, but I imagine I would have been more wowed had there not been a mass of scaffolding over the main hall that substituted for this by hanging up a large print of what you could no longer see behind it.
I may as well have been looking at a picture online. Although actually, I blame the online pictures for my disappointing experience because they make it look so spectacular.

Inside, you could see a reconstruction of the old Ryukyuan King's throne, amongst other reconstructed artefacts and an exhibition of some legitimate heritage items. Only trouble is, my enthusiasm for such things had dulled because I was so let down by the unexpected scaffolding.

I'll admit, there were some other factors not related to the castle that coloured my enjoyment of it. For one, I'd travelled to Okinawa in June, but it was the rainy season so although it was hot it was tipping down so I was walking around the castle getting drenched (didn't do the gardens because of this).
Also, I'd mistakenly imagined the castle would be in a beautiful setting a stone's throw from the beach. This is the impression you get when you see pictures in guide books and such. But it was in the middle of the UGLIEST CITY IN THE ENTIRE WORLD - Naha.

Entrance fee: 860 yen (tad overpriced). I noticed some accessible areas, but in order to get in to the place I had to go up some steep stairs so not sure about that.
We drove there. Wasn't difficult navigating the roads.","Written June 3, 2018"

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Attractive reconstructed castle,"The castle has been extensively reconstructed after being pretty much destroyed during the war. This means it looks good, but there's a certain missing authenticity to it. Of course it is still well worth a visit, although I didn't bother paying to go into the inner sanctum since that didn't look very authentic at all.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Nothing original .....,"Shurijo castle is definitely worth a visit. It's very sad that hardly any part of it is original, it was all destroyed by the Americans in 1945. It has however been beautifully restored and much of it is quite recent. It costs 820Ypp for entry and the ticket booth is quite a distance inside the gate so don't think you've missed it just keep walking. The grounds are also beautiful to walk through and you can see old tunnels and a beautiful bridge over the lake.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,"Impressive castle and restoration work, don't miss the Tea & cookies menu!","The reviews were in favour of the castle's gardens but not of the castle itself. We were very happy that we've decided to buy tickets for the castle, as it shows a perfect example of the ancient reign and of the incredible restoration work & lacquer painting invested there. The temporary exhibition featured treasures of the kings and was very interesting as well. We almost missed it, as it is in the hosting chambers, the tea room where one can pay for a tea & cookies set. The 4 different cookies follow ancient recipes and the tea can be refilled by the nice staff. A great break from the heat as well, overlooking the Zen garden. Do plan 2-3 hours if you include the castle tour, as well as the gardens.",

After exploring the castle buildings you can take a walk outside to view the castle walls and external gardens. There are some steps and slopes to navigate along the way but nothing too steep.

A pleasant way to spend the morning (2 hours or so) visiting one of Okinawa's main attractions. After visiting the castle you can visit a nearby Japanese wine making shop, the Awamori Zuisen Distillery, about 4 mins away by car and from there to a quaint Okinawan restaurant nearby called Ryukyu Sabo Ashibiuna for lunch.",

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Need more signage,"We probably followed the signage for cars and walked a longer route to get to the castle. We walked to Ryutan-dori from the monorail station. From there, we walked along route 29 and 49 to the main access way (Samukawa-dori) to Shurijo Castle, passing blue seal ice cream, Lawson convenience store and Ryutan (dragon pond) on our way. Based on google map, it was a 1.4 km walk. We would have shortened the walk by 300m if we turned left after Lawson. But it was late March, the weather was nice and there were lots of blooming flowers along the way, the longer walk wasn't strenuous at all.

On entering Samukawa-dori, you will pass by a little house on your right which has a resting place, lockers, toilets and a souvenir shop. We would have missed this place if we took the left turn at Lawson. This place also distributes a stamping pamphlet where fans can affix location ink stamps to the pamphlet when you reach various locations in Shurijo Castle.

We reached Shurijo Castle at 10 am+ then slowly toured the castle compound. Access is free until you reach the square inside Koufukumon (廣福門). The suggested route is to take the stairs from Kankaimon (歓會門) to Koufukumon (廣福門), tour the castle and indoor exhibits (purchase the entrance tickets at the counter near Koufukumon (廣福門)), then exit via the slope from the square inside Koufukumon (廣福門) to Kobikimon (木曳門).

Be sure to see the miniature replica on display. There are several buildings that are part of the complex - each one served its own function and offers a distinct uniqueness. The displays are in Japanese, Chinese and English (I think Korean, too) and are well written giving the viewer a feel for what life was like during the castle’s heyday in Ryukyuan culture.

Japan,Shurijo Castle,Any visit to Okinawa should include a trip to Shuri Jo and the surroundings,"The castle is in the midst of some renovations so the front is obscured by scaffolding as of Oct 2017. That said it will look fantastic once the laquer has been applied.
The tour is well worth the price and will greatly enhance most peoples knowledge of Okinawan history.
Remember, the castle (jo) was destroyed in WWII so this is a very faithful recreation of what the castle looked like. They are careful to point out the original parts that you can still see.
I highly recommend a walk down the ""stone tatami"" path and eating at the restuarant you find on your right at the end of the path.","Written February 4, 2018"

I went over the weekend, and it was exactly what I thought it was going to be ... a castle! Lol. The entrance fee is 800JPY, which I was not expecting. You need to pay this in order to go through the gates to see the castle. Once through the gates, you will see the castle and a museum entrance to your right. This museum entrance walks you through the castle and has things such as portraits of previous Emperors. Some areas you are not able to take photos of, but most areas, you are. If you are expecting to see a castle and a piece of history, you will be satisfied (I was!).",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Nice Park for a Stroll and Pictures,"Located at the end of the monorail station about 15 minutes walk away. Expect to climb some stairs and slopes. The views up the top were quite nice.

The park is clean and expect tour groups there so can be a little noisy. Usually a Mandarin speaking tour guide will lead Chinese visitors there. You may even be able to stand around to listen about the park and the castle.

Inside the building there’s a historic museum to tell the history of Okinawa and some old things to see. Outside the garden there’s old stone walls that gives you the historic feeling. It took 2 to 3 hours to view the whole area and it is a must-go place for the travelers who want to add some historic part in their trip in Okinawa.,
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Nothing special,"Well, it's the place not to be missed when you are in Naha, but don't expect to be astonished with the scene. Positive things are that there is the great view of the city and performance you could see there. Can be boring for the kids.",
Japan,Shurijo Castle,Might be Boring for Kids,"I'm glad we went. It was a nice day to stroll around and I can say I've been, but I wouldn't go again and I think most kids will be bored.

Our favorite part of the site was exploring the grounds in search of stamp pads to stamp a souvenir map. If you collect all the stamps, you receive a nice gift of a small plastic folder, stickers, a coloring book, and a special stamp.

Upon reaching the paid, museum area, you are handed a plastic bag to carry your shoes. You tour the castle and museum in your bare feet.

As others have commented, the castle just has a lot of empty rooms that look alike, limited captions, and not much else.

There's an inexpensive cafe where we enjoyed a corn dog and fried rice. Both were good, but clearly just re-heated in a microwave.

Free covered parking is available, lockers that you can rent for 100 yen that is returned to you after you return the key.

The gift shops contained standard Okinawa souvenirs - nothing very unique to just the castle.","Written January 24, 2018"

There are many sites within the castle park. Each stop u can stamp the location. About 24 stopover points. Kids get excited stamping on the map. They will give u a map with blank space at the ticket counter.
From castle top see okinawa city. Quite amazing, the castle had been restored so more modern looking. U have to take off shoes before entering the main castle where you see where the king sleeps , etc. So wear socks. They will give u a bag to put your shoes. Do not take photos inside.

It is definitely more ideal to take the cable car up and do a descend walk rather than the other way due to the gradient of the slope.

There is a cafe at midpoint in the glass house but it’s quite pricey so i would advice you to bring some snacks as the garden has many good spots for a picnic.

Since it is called an herb garden, there are herbs everywhere. You can purchase them or simply admire them in carts or on the hillside.
There is a Fragrance Museum and one of the options is for you to build your own fragranced perfume or bath oil to later purchase as a souvenir.
There is also another building called the Glasshouse which I suppose Westerners would call a Greenhouse. However, this one had a little stream running through it along with a miniature waterfall. In order to get to the Greenhouse from the summit, you need to walk down a bit along the paved path.

Our next target was the recreation area - a lawn area on the hill offering a stunning view of KOBE city and the sea beyond. Here one can lie down on a hammock and enjoy looking at the deep blue sea and sky. After this, we headed to mid station to catch the ropeway to go all the way down. Before reaching , we encountered the last garden - Kaze no Oka flower garden. Really beautiful. We had lavender soft ice cream at the outdoor cafe.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great place to visit,Near Shin-Kobe station. We caught the nunobiki ropeway to the top. Nice view of Kobe city. They have many herbs on display. Nice walk down the hill as there are many different gardens to check out.,"Written November 9, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,One of the best locations we visited in Japan!,"An absolute must if you're planning to visit Kobe, or West Japan in general! The herb garden is conveniently located very close to Shin-Kobe station so it's easy to get to from Shin-Osaka. You take a cable car to the top; two of us aren't great with heights but the views are so beautiful you forget all about your fears. Once you get to the top, you are presented with incredible views across Kobe. You can then visit a lovely shop with great smelling products before descending down. There are loads of beautiful gardens and areas to chill. I would recommend lying on the hammocks and taking in the breathtaking views. We were lucky enough to also see some beautiful butterflies and hummingbirds. In summary, a great and unique place to visit!","Written October 21, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Garden with herbs and herb products,Lots of interesting products made from herbs in the shop on the top. It is good way to use the rope way to the top and walk down to the middle stop and to see the different parts of the garden. Beatiful place allthough all flowers were not on there best during this time of the year. Especially enjoyed the herb foot bath.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Skip this,"At time of our visit (early October), some of the plants and flowers have already wilted. It's a bit hard to appreciate because of the lack of English narratives to explain where specific herbs are commonly used. The gardens were also spread out in different areas so you had to hop from one small garden to another.

We appreciated the garden better while riding the cable car up the garden.","Written October 12, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Peaceful escape,A must visit location in Kobe. The garden has wonderful views over the city and is a great way to spend a couple hours out of the hustle and bustle. You can hike up for purchase cable car tickets to access the garden. A great spot to enjoy a cup of tea or an ice cream and unwind.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Most Beautiful and Colorful Gardens,"From Shin-Kobe Station you can go upstairs and take the Nunobiki Ropeway and on the top you will see the most beautiful and colorful garden. There are a lot of flowers, herbs, plants, and trees. We took a lot of photos because it is so beautiful. You can see flowers in the colors of the rainbow arranged beautifully in every direction.

There is a gift shop that sells everything herb (herb cookies, herb tea) and aromatherapy-related products, like essential oils, diffusers, soaps, and you can even pick a herb in a cart (like lavender) and buy it. There is also a restaurant next to the gift shop that sells main courses and desserts like ice creams.

To get to the middle ropeway station, you can hike down from the top garden and see more plants and flowers. A really beautiful place to walk around. More photos taken and there is also a waterfall patio in the shade of trees so you can rest a bit after a long walk down.

A really recommended place to visit when you are in Kobe. It is really nice to take a break from the busy city to a quiet and beautiful garden that will please your heart and eyes.",

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Nice afternoon out,"The cable car is near Shin Kobe station. The journey on the cable car is in 2 stages - you can do it all in one go or hop off at the middle station. We went to the top, walked back down through the gardens and hot the cable car back down from the middle station. Nice walk but steep. Stopped off for a drink and ice-cream. Views from cable car and at the top station are fantastic. Nice rose garden at the top full of English David Austin roses!","Written October 7, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A Great View of Kobe,"We took the Ropeway to the top station and then took the walkwaysthrough the many herb and flower gardens.
It was a beautiful aroma and a great view of Kobe.
Plenty of places to eat, we had lunch at the Glasshouse.","Written October 3, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great couple of hours,Definitely worth a visit. The return fare is ¥1500. We got the cable car to the top and walked slowly down through the various gardens which I found more interesting than I thought I would. We stopped at the glasshouse for a coffee and admire the glorious view over Kobe. Thankfully it was not too warm on the day so it was a very pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.,"Written October 3, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Arrive early and stay the day,"Go early and make a day of it. I made the day trip by train from Osaka - the garden is quickly and efficiently accessible from the subway stop. Just one flight up the elevator and follow the signs.

The tram ride was spectacular - you can see the famous waterfall, dam and take in a breathtaking view of the seaport and Kobe City.

I took the tram all the way up, strolled through the gardens at a leisurely pace and then took the tram back down at midpoint. Cost was 1500 yen round trip - super reasonable as that includes admission, an umbrella rental (for shade) and a 10 minute go at the relaxing herb foot bath (just pay 100 yen for a towel rental to wipe down your thankful feet afterward).

I can highly recommend the honey lemon soda (top station cafe) and the lavender ice cream for a refresher (booth near mid station).

I brought a book and sat at the many sitting areas - so many ideal spots to zen out! They even have hammocks for your relaxing enjoyment!

The glass garden was spectacular and was my favorite part of the garden.

See my photos for all the points of interest mentioned in this review and have a fabulous time!",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Marvellous experience,We had a day to spare in Kobe before watching a rugby game. When we read the reviews we were unsure whether it would be worth the visit. We took the cable car up and walked down. It was a lovely day. The gardens were spectacular and the walk down was lovely (although we did take a wrong turn or 2!). Would highly recommend,"Written September 30, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Cable car service closed suddenly without notice,"We went to this garden and to buy 3 round trip tickets, then get on the cable car. We are understand that the travelling time in cable car is a little bit longer because of strong wind. But the worse is we are walking around at the top and stay for around half an hour, then we walk to the middle station and try to get on the cable car back to the station. The staff told us that the cable car is now stop service and we have to walk to the mountain (from middle station back to station is for an hour). I am wondering why the car is suddenly stop service and did not have any announcement during walking downwards to the middle station. This is extremely bad! Many tourists like us did not alert that the car will suddenly stop service. We paid for round trip and did not have any other travelling tools back to station. After I negotiated with the staff and insist to arrange a car to deliver us back to station, then we wait for 15 mins, they finally arrange a car for us. If I am not asked for other transportation for us, then we have to walk for an hour back to station. I blamed that the gardens should have responsibility to take care of the tourists when the weather is not good enough for tour.","Written September 29, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Brilliant view,We walked from Shin Kobe station via the nearby shopping mall.We took the Ropeway which is a cable car.You can alight at the middle station and look at the extensive herb garden or do as we did and carry on to the next station.This has a viewing platform and bars and restaurants.We bought a dark beer and admired the view of Kobe bay and the Seto Inland sea.,"Written September 29, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Unless you want a long walk take the round trip ticket,"Access is via the ropeway or the falls. If you walk via the falls it’s a lot further.
The gardens are a linear display of a variety of different types of plants grouped by type, ie herbs are together.
Cafe facilities available.","Written September 26, 2019"

Fully recommend getting round trip ticket for the rope car.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Peaceful way to spend an afternoon,"Great views on the cable car going up. Then can take your time strolling down. Best to not be in a rush to enjoy all the seating areas and view along the way down.

Came on a Saturday and was pleasantly surprised it wasn't that crowded.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great view by night,"We recommend to go there by night.

The garden is already closed. You can go to the top with the ropeway (discounted admission after 5PM) and enjoy a beautiful view of the city and a peaceful atmosphere since there are no tourists anymore.
The last ride down is at 9PM.

Altough the prices are not cheap but the ride up alone is absoultely worth it.

The ground station is not that easy to find.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Beautiful,We took the cable car up around sunset and got an incredible view of Kobe from here. My friend and I waited until night time to leave and it is just as beautiful at night time too. The herb gardens themselves are also beautiful. The bar staff are lovely and very understanding and they speak some English. A definite recommended for anyone who enjoys a good view.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A real treat in Kobe,"I am so glad to be here. I was able to view the panoramic view of the city. If you have the Kobe Tourism coupon, you can save 700yen from the cable car.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Best garden so far in Japan,This garden totally different from other place in Japan. Love every single things in this Garden. Love the ropeway which is the best view of Kobe. You can see the sea over here. Then in the peak you had the calm and peacefull situation. So relaxing!!!! The price for ropeway is 1.500 yen and that's totally worth it! Love ya,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Cable car service closed suddenly without notice,,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Beautiful gardens and a nice hike down,"We took the cable car up to the top station, which gave us a nice view of the city and steal view of the gardens.
The gardens themselves were serene and beautiful, and very quiet at the time of our visit due to it raining a bit.
We walked down through the garden, and visited the glass greenhouse, before continuing down the hiking trail.
As soon as we left the garden gates, a wild boar with a small piglet ran grunting across the road!
The hike down through the green forests, over bridges and past waterfalls was a nice and easy walk, with plenty of sights.
We probably spent around 3 hours from the top of the gardens and back down to the station, walking at a very slow pace, taking in the scenery and taking alot of pictures.","Written June 27, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,one of my favourites places in Japan,"Take up the ropeway, enjoy the views over Kobe and then walk down a beautiful garden and greenhouse and see some waterfalls.

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A little boring but very nice views,Went there with the kids and the tram was a lot of fun. The garden itself is very impressive . Lots of steps and walking so bring lots of water. There is an ice-cream concession at the mid point and it is a rip-off so don't bother with that. Bring your own food. My wife really liked this place and I thought it was okay.,"Written June 23, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Lovely walk,"We spent a couple of hours at the herb garden in the morning before getting on our cruise and it was very relaxing.

We caught the ropeway to the top station, walked around the area and then slowly walked down to the middle station. There're heaps to see in the walk including the glasshouses and also a free foot bath near the glass house which was awesome.

You can also see the waterfall from the ropeway. I would like to walk to the waterfall but didn't have enough time.

Definitely worth spending a couple of hours in the garden.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Serene,"We did a quick trip up the ropeway and walked down. Not enough time to take it all in, but what we saw and smelled was fragrant, well marked, explained in English and Japanese, with what looked like a lot of interactive learning opportunities along the way. Lush plantings and scents surround you during the entire experience.","Written June 17, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Worth the trip!,We almost didn’t do this trip as it didn’t seem to be a popular attraction. But luckily we did! Both the elderly and kids in our group thoroughly enjoyed the trip. View of Kobe from the rope way was fascinating. The walk down the garden to mid hill station was very enjoyable. Many varieties of flowers to see. We had fun smelling the different flower scent. All of us also had herbal foot bath at the glasshouse. Totally worth the trip!,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Relaxing time enjoying the flowers and views from ropeway.,"Both ropeway and gardens are wheelchair accessible. The gardens’ information centre provides free use of electric wheelchair to explore gardens that has slopes not suited for manual wheelchair.

Nice views of Kobe city",

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,So beautiful!,"We had a really nice time in this beautiful garden. We were sort of exhausted from spending the last two days in Osaka and Universal Studios and this peaceful garden was just what we needed to re-energize. We took the Ropeway to the top and walked down from there. We explored all the different flowers and herbs, bought some specialty products and soaked our feet in the herbal bath overlooking Kobe.
We decided to hike all the way down to the nearby waterfalls. It was not that bad of a hike and the falls were beautiful. We arrived back at the Shin-Osaka Station at the end of the day.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,BEAUTIFUL!!!,"I had only a few hours to tour Kobe and this spot was recommended by the hotel information. I was lucky to have a clear beautiful day, the blooming was breathtaking and the Japanese gardening is just amazing. Don't miss!!",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Spectacular,One of the stops on the City Loop Bus. Easy walk from Shin Kobe through the ANA hotel. Normal return Rope Way (cable car) Y 1500. < 10 minutes ride to the summit. Groups and individuals appear to get their own car. From the top the view over Kobe is spectacular. Of course the usual F&B / retail outlets at all levels. I chose to walk down to the middle Station. What a great move. If time had permitted I would have walked all the way down to the base. Recommend buy a one way ticket up and walk down. Try the Lavender Ice Cream 😛,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,German inspired buildings with an amazing view,"We entered the gardens by ropeway, and felt immediately like we left Japan. The architecture of the buildings on the top is very inspired by Germany, and there are lots of small shops for food and drinks. The gardens themselves are very nice and well kept. For a city like Kobe that does not have that many attractions, this is definately a place worth going to - however expensive to access by ropeway.","Written May 23, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,"Fantastic Gardens, with Great Views of Kobe","This is a great trip to see fabulous gardens, with amazing views from the cable car and the various terraces. The gardens are delightful, and you can walk back down through the gardens to the half way station. It would be spectacular later in the season when the tulips and the roses start to bloom. Very well priced, considering how much time you can spend there.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A definite must visit,"The Herb & Flower Gardens are located on a hillside. The best way to explore is to access the top and gradually walk down.

Take a subway to Shin-Kobe Station; then ask any friendly local, where the 'Ropeway to Nunobiki' is. Within the station is an elevator that will eventually take you up and out to a pathway with signs pointing up to the Ropeway station.

The ropeway is the Japanese term for cablecar. Take a slow walk upwards to the ropeway. The price for the ride is also the entrance fee to the gardens.

Staff will advise you to take the cablecar to the highest station, then explore and stroll downwards, until the middle station and take the cablecar downwards.

If you have time, 2-3 hours will be fantastic. If you plan to have lunch up at the top station 3-4 hours will be sufficient. If you are pressed for time, 1-2 hours will still leave you happy.

Depending on the season, different flowers will be in bloom. Gardeners, landscape workers, horticulturalists, all busy like bees. Surely a labor of love. Waterfalls, streams, rest benches, all make this place so restful and relaxing. If only we have a whole day.

I found a herb I liked very much; unfortunately its dried leaves were not sold at the souvenir shop. The herb has the exact aroma of the Japanese curry, and I thought it would be marvellous to make my own Japanese curry at home.

There are restaurants and shops at the top. Views of the city are fantastic.","Written May 17, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A nice view on top of a mountain,"The Herb Garden is set on top of a hill just above the Kobe station. There are two ways to reach the Herb garden. You could walk up the hill or take a cable car.
Walking up the hill is only for those who have at least half a day of time or better a day.
At the top, there is a view of the Kobe city.",

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Very nice in spring though a bit commercial,"The ropeway up is very nice, but a beautiful view of Kobe. The gardens are nice with herbs and pretty flowers. Very lovely on a sunny day in spring. You can enjoy fragrances, some food, beer or wine and it's just pleasant to spend some time there. Not spectacular, but it doesn't always has to be, as it is highly relaxing. They do sell all kinds of stuff and give you multiple flyers with promotions and such, which is kind of a shame, but understandable. People interested in all kinds of beauty products could have a field day here.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,A perfect Spring outing,"Enjoyed this place immensely, The gondola ride up offered stunning views of Kobe.The gardens were in full spring bloom with cherry blossoms, tulips, hyacinths and many more flowers.

Do not cone to Kansai without visiting here:),
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Rainy Yet Wonderful,"The day I visited it was raining but not too heavily. So, even though I wanted to hike up to the gardens it made sense to take the cable car which I did. The views were amazing and the ride to the top was smooth and comfortable.

The garden had a variety of beautiful herbs and flowers which were arranged to fit the setting. I enjoyed smelling the variety of oils and taking in the views from different areas of the garden. The shop is well stocked and the restaurant menu is varied.

I'd definitely like to visit again someday.",

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Colorful Gardens At The Top,"This garden offers fantastic view not only of the colorful flowers in the area, but it also gives you scenic view of Kobe port and Osaka area. Going there is equally fun as you will take a cable ride of about 20 minutes to the top, offering scenic views as well of the mountains and the waterfall along the way.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Well worth the trip to the top,"Picked up the cable car close to Shin Kobe JR station. The entrance was close to the Ana Crowne Plaza hotel.

We booked a return trip by cable car up to see the herb gardens. The cost in GBP was approximately £11 pp.

A lovely ride up in the cable car with simply stunning views over Kobe and right out to sea. On a clear day you will get some lovely pictures.

The gardens themselves were very pretty and there were a couple of gift shops and a cafe and tourist information counter.
Lots of seating areas and picnic facilities.

There was an excellent viewing platform which provided more picture opportunities.

Well worth a trip up for the views alone. We went up first thing in the morning and it was lovely and quiet.","Written April 1, 2019"

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,You can’t go wrong!,"This is a great little excursion if you have a few hours and want to get outdoors.

Ride up- walk down. Browse the first shop, wander through the gardens, stop for tea and a pork cutlet sandwich at the glass house, then take a short jaunt in a little forest and past a waterfall. The waterfall is less incredible than the view from the basin so look up and around.

Emerge behind Shin-Kobe station and grab a snack from the 7-11.","Written March 14, 2019"

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Nunobiki Herb Garden – Beautiful Japanese (Botanical) Gardens,"We took a Taxi from the Kobe Cruise Port to the Nunobiki Herb Gardens on Mount Rokko for around $15 CAD. A round-trip ticket on the Gondola (in Japan they call Gondolas “Ropeways”) cost $1500 yen ($18 CAD) per person. Buy your ticket inside from a machine and then walk to the Gondola boarding area.

Once onboard it takes about 10 minutes to get to the top Terrace (the views are fantastic) where there are many gardens (flowers, herbs) and a shop that sells different botanical/other products. You can easily spend 2 to 3 hours here. The Veranda Café is a bit pricey $4,800 Yen for English style Tea and cakes for 3 people (around $20 CAD each) but for the great views, atmosphere and excellent service it’s worth the price!

We walked down to mid-way station (you have to) to get back on board the Gondola; the paths are full of beautiful plants and there is a waterfall you can visit. It is a bit steep though, so it wouldn’t be good for anyone who has trouble walking, but there are places to stop and rest. There’s a City Loop Bus stop nearby (after you exit the Main building follow the signs down a small hill) so when we left to go to the Chinatown area downtown, we took the bus.

In Kobe the City Loop Bus (Stops are clearly marked) Adults Fares cost $260Y for a single fare ($3 CAD) or $660Y for an All-day Pass ($8 CAD), you just pay the Driver. It takes you to many different locations and tourist sites throughout the City, including the Nunobiki Herb Gardens and downtown Mall area, and runs every 20 minutes but it does get very crowded. From the Mall you can easily walk to the 2 main shopping districts in Kobe and Chinatown.

Tip - Sign up (on your phone) for Kobe FREE Wi-Fi, it can be used by Tourists for up to 7 days and worked well in the Cruise Port Terminal AND throughout most areas in Kobe.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Blue love,"I was madly in love with the amazing view from top of the mountain to see. The rope way of herb garden was fantastic and adventurous.Glass house was very beautiful. As it was down season , I missed to enjoy the actual beauty of the garden with flowers.Kobe is a very small city and it is possible to cover up the whole kobe within nearly half a day if you are not going to spend time in shopping.But I loved to do shopping there. To me the most attractive was the mesmerizing view of sea port, light breeze ....in a word AMAZING!!!!!!","Written February 27, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Gorgeous - a must visit for Kobe,"We visited Kobe on a day trip from cruise ship.
We undertook as a self directed activity and just got a taxi with another couple from the ship port up to Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens and took the mountain scenic car ropeway.

Great ride up on the cable car and lookout over Kobe.

Cute photo opps in the gorgeous gardens with giant bees and butterfly’s buzzing around.

There is a nice gift shop up the top, get lost in all the scents with handmade oils etc

Gorgeous glasshouse at mid level- really worth a visit - steamy lush gardens.

I recommend if you have time and are reasonably fit enough (ie no major injuries) then catch the cable car up one way and walk down through the levels at your own leisure and really enjoy. It’s an easy walk down and a beautiful environment to wander around and rest in.

We had the most delicious lavender ice cream cones at mid level.

We caught taxi into town from hotel down the bottom of mountain.

The garden is really romantic and calm, there’s a lot of couples! I would recommend it to people who want to see a beautiful view on Kobe and who wants to take a break from the city and walk around in the nature! Lovely time spent here :)

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Wonderful attraction,"This place offers a few things: a quiet ride up the hill for an overview of Kobe, lovely garden to stroll in (better in spring or autumn for the colors), a small section of essential oils (to find out your preferred scent), gift shop to buy a momento or two, greenhouse (for visitors in winter who still want to see some greens) and the Garden Terrace (if you need a bite). Would definitely recommend a visit here.","Written January 1, 2019"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,"Well worth the trip to the top, even in winter","I would highly recommend this attraction. You can spend half a day here as there are plenty of small gardens, a herbal footbath, sachet making etc. It is very scenic and you get a great view over Kobe.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Nice soothing garden with nice gift shop,"Visited in Dec 2018 and took a cable car up to the very top and arrived at the gardens. Not the best season to visit as there aren't many flowers. However, it does have a very nice view overlooking the city and a soothing scent of herbs mixed in the grass.

They sell a lot of nice essential oils and you should definitely try them. You can buy them if you are into aromatherapy but if you aren't, just take a sniff. Since the flowers and herbs are home-grown, it smells very different from what you will get in your hometowns. Especially the lavender one smells different but still calming as compared to French Lavender.

After that, we took a slow walk down to the mid-station where we pass by the greenhouse as well.

Tip: I noticed a lot of people just walked quickly down to the greenhouse and after that to the mid-station. Walk slowly and look around, there are many trees, flowers, herbs, fruits, vegetables, herbs and many more which you can admire. The plants are also labelled with the name of their species so take a moment to admire them as well!

If not for the season I visited in, I would have given it a 5 star.","Written December 24, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Herb Garden and cable car ride,Nice elevated view of Kobe. Great place to visit any time off the year. Forested hills makes good photography point.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Wonderful Place,You must visit the garden and glasshouse even when it is cold and the weather not so good. Everything is beautifully arranged and clean. Good sign posts and explanations. Nice walk (but steep so you need good shoes) and a bit of energy. The buildings and perfume exhibitions are nicely done. I’d always come back here again,

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Very nice and tranquil.,"This place is awesome. Very close to shin kobe station. You can hike up and down but the best is to take the cable car up. The cable car offers 1 way up or both way. Price differ if you buy together and separate. My advice is to buy both ways. You can hike down to the middle station and take the cable car down.

This place has many beautiful plants and flowers. With the cooling weather, it is just perfect. The very top is the main part where they house cafes and souvenir shop and etc.

Hike down to see the flowers and the glass house. Glasshouse is beautiful. They have a restaurant called The Verandah. Nicely decorated and they also have an indoor garden.

Along the hike down there's a picnic place where you can rest and relax.

During winter it will get very cold and windy.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Beautifully laid out garden,"Take the cable car (ropeway) up to the mountain and a very gentle walk back down to the mid station. the plants on the walk down, which takes about 45 minutes, or longer if you stop and read about each exhibit, are stunningly laid out, with good explanations accompanying the plants and herbs. To walk down from the mid station back to the bottom takes about 90 minutes, so most people walk the first section then get the ropeway back to ground level.
We visited this herb garden after going to Himeji castle from Osaka and returned to Osaka, so both can be accomplished in the same but tiring day","Written November 26, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Would probably be better in the summer.,"Came here in the fall and although their four seasons gardens and changing fall leaves was still very nice, I imagine this place is much prettier in the spring or summer when all flowers are in full bloom. Even so, the place is gorgeous and the indoor gardens is very nice. Really nice and relaxing place to spend the day (there's even a foot spa by the glass house/greenhouse to rest your tired feet on your way down).",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great garden with nice views of kobe,"Fantastic day with a great view! Peaceful and calm. Cable car was fun, had the cable car to ourselves. There was the option to hike down the entire as well.

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,"Beautiful gardens, scenic and relaxing","Took the cable car up to the top and walked down.

The gardens were beautiful, filled with flowers and landscaping plants. There's also a few scenic spots where you can chill and relax, overseeing Kobe.

There's a footbath area, it's free, just need to pay 100JPY for a towel to dry your feet after.

I spent a good 2hours there.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Breathtaking view,The view of Kobe from the ropeway is breathtaking. Upon arriving at the highest station you are greeted by a feast of different flowers. We ventured into the rose garden and the perfume from the different roses was a delightful aroma. We walked down the hill and were greeted by beds and beds of flowers. What an enchanting place.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great view and nice Ropeway,"It’s a 6 min walk from Shin-Kobe station, great Ropeway getting us all the way to the top and the view is amazing !",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Stunning view,"We walked up and took the rope way down . Probably would have been smarter to do it the other way around! The gardens were pretty I'm not a huge flower person but it was nice. The village at the top was interesting with souvenirs, German food and beer. It was strange being in a german type village with weird Disneyland music playing loudly. But they view over Kobe was so so pretty. It was quiet enough that we got our own cart the whole way down. Had a nice lavender icecream in the garden.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Aroma galire,Very nice place. Lotsa flowers. Enjoyed the ropeway ride. There was also a fragrance museum. Roses were so lovely.,
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Lovely Garden to walk through,"From the top of ropeway you walk down the hill which gives you nice views of Kobe. There is a wide, winding cement path that cuts through as you enjoy the plants and flowers. There may be a little too much to see but it's nice to stroll through, plus there are some benches where you take a rest. And don't forget to try relaxing in a hammock. There are a couple of locations where they are set out for visitors and you can lie down and relax while enjoying the view. About halfway down there is a place where you can hop back on the ropeway which takes you back down.","Written October 15, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Pleasant time with a ropeway ride,"The Herb Garden is located very near the JR Shin Kobe Station. In fact as you get off the Shinkansen in the station you see the gondolas move over the mountain in the backdrop of the station. You will have to fork out 1500 yen for a round trip on the gondola and visit to the herb garden.We wanted to walk down( one way ticket is 950 yen) on the way back but we were told at the information booth that it would take us 2 hours to do that and that the route will be dark in the evening. A gondola seemed to accommodate 4 persons and they earmark one gondola per family even if the number of members are less than 4. The staff is young and friendly and the ropeway is very safe and the views terrific . On the way up you can enjoy the view of a dam a waterfall besides a panoramic view of Kobe harbour. Nearer the end of the ride you will go past very colourful gardens.Take the ropeway right up to the Herb Gardens Top Station( although you have the option of getting off at the Mid Station). At the top are view rest houses, restaurants, shops selling various items including those made from herb. You can see the Rose Symphony Garden, Miri no Hall ( concert hall), etc. which have nice decorations. We also saw a Fragnance museum and a Fragrant Garden( from which we saw the walking trail but did not see anyone on it) but did not think much of it. You then walk down the lovely garden path past the Herb Museum,Kitchen Garden , Lavender Garden ( where is the Lavender?)a detour to a Glasshouse( spend some time, the view is terrific, there are cafes too),Four Seasons Garden , lovely Kaze no Oka Flower Garden and finally board the gondola at the Mid Station. There are adequate public toilets in the walk. They close by around 5.30 PM however on weekends and holidays the top observatory is open till 8.30PM. Overall a little overpriced but worth it. Earmark at least 2 hours for this attraction.",

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Japan with an alpine feel,"We didn’t think there would be such gorgeous gardens this late in the year, but everywhere we looked there were blossoms and even buds. The rope way is fun, two to a car (other locations should take note of this and stop cramming 6-8 total strangers in a car!) The view of Kobe is spectacular. We rode up and walked down—you would never know there was a typhoon three days ago!",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Stunning area.,"Cable car (called rope car in Japan) to and from this location is both fun and very cheap.

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Peaceful and scenic garden,"Although not exactly a garden person, I must admit this underrated attraction has wowed me with its scenic hill slope location, peacefully tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city below. The best way to enjoy this garden is to take the ropeway to the Rest House at the top station, and casually stroll down the easy footpath. Along the way, you will be whiffed by the pleasant aromas from the the herbs and flowers, overwhelmed with perfectly manicured gardens, and be enchanted by the serenity within the Glasshouse. Just before you re-board the cable car at the mid station, relax on the hammock at the recreation area as you gaze down on the port city of Kobe and it’s sparkling bay beyond.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Serenity,"If you're into flowers and plants, this is the place for you. The place is so serene and peaceful, very nice to have a morning walk. There are plenty of places to sit and just relax, there are even hammocks around. Different types of flowers and vegatables abound, much like a really huge garden. There are also a cable cars going into the garden and you will see a falls - we tried walking here but got lost- and realized that this is already out of the Herb garden area. There's also an essential oils museum where you can smell the different types of oils and i believe they sell them too, some as expensive as ten thousand yen! There are also food stands and restaurants selling local delights at reasonable price. Over all, this is a nice place to visit, prepare to spend at least 2- 4 hours depending on how much you're into botany.","Written August 27, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,More of a gift shop / restaurant than extensive gardens,"As you arrive at the top of the ropeway to the Kobe herb garden you'll find that the main area is more of a restaurant and gift shop than anything else.

The gardens themselves, as you descend down the hill again, are quite nice and there are a few nice places to stop and rest (hammocks and seating provided) and the views over Kobe are really good.

However, the gardens aren't terribly extensive and there isn't a great deal of exploring to do. If you are expecting a botanic garden type experience you may need to lower your expectations.

Having said that given the views it is still a good way to spend a few hours in Kobe.","Written August 17, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great place to view of the city,"We took cable car to the top. Unfortunately we were unable to go to the herb garden as it was closed (so early).

There wasn't much to walk around so we waited for over two hours to see the night view of the city. It was wonderful. Besides, it said there would be lights performance every 20 minutes at night but we saw nothing.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Beautiful views of Kobe and spectacular gardens!,"We arrived on a cruise ship, took the Portliner monorail to Sannomiya Station, transferred to the subway to Shinkobe and found our way to the Ropeway to the Nunobiki Herb Garden. Even though few people speak English, the signage is good—and in English, so you can find your way. The ride up in the gondola was spectacular. Clear blue skies allowed perfect views of Kobe and the harbor below. We bought a one-way ticket, planning to walk down through the gardens. At the top we found the beautiful View Plaza—full of flowers and statues and displays—perfect for photos. Cherry blossoms presented a lovely view as the wind blew beautiful pink blossoms through the air. We stopped to see the Fragrance Museum, with displays of perfume bottles from the 1900’s. You can actually create your own perfume there if you want. Walking down through the gardens full of tulips, azaleas, pansies, wild flowers, and beautifully manicured trees was amazing. We explored the amazing glass greenhouse full of plants and flowers, and continued down the path through more gardens with waterfalls, herbs, and flowers. By the time we got to the midway station, we opted to take the gondola back to the bottom—skipping the rest of the hiking trail and the lower waterfalls, though we did catch a glimpse of them from the gondola on the way down. It was a magnificent morning, and we highly recommend it!",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Interesting place and worth the visit,"We hiked up from the shin Kobe JR station pass. all the waterfalls and ended up at herb gardens.

However, the heat was killing us. Anyway, we still enjoyed the fragrance museum. We split into two groups. One tried the fragrance workshops. The other group walked down to visit the herb garden.

We stopped in the area at the top to have a drink of speciality Japanese tea in one place and a lunch snack in another and toexplore the herb museum and the shops.

The cable car ride was fun and the views terrific, but the walk back down (halfway) through the gardens was a delight. There were more herbs and spices growing than I knew existed and the gardens were beautifully maintained. Many of the pants had their names in Latin and Japanese and some in English.

They were interleaved with lavender bushes, so I get the feeling that the garden will be even more impressive with one or more flowers from about March to whenever their maple leaves turn red.

Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,if you love gardens and fragrant flowers and so much more...,"...then you must put this ""so much more than just a herb garden"" at the very top of your list when you are in kobe. as the website says:
""Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens are Japan’s largest herb gardens with about 75,000 herbs and flowers of about 200 kinds blooming throughout the year.
""There are 14 garden areas where visitors are welcomed by seasonal herbs and flowers arranged according to different themes.""
but indeed there's so much more than that - from the 10-minute 400m ""ropeway"" (gondola) ride up mount rokko to the 16ha (40-acre) garden (look down for a glimpse of nunobiki waterfall) to the food variety (snacks to very fancy pastries with special teas) to the flower- and herb-based soaps, lotions, posies and other shopping delights.
and let's not forget the panoramic view over kobe - city and harbour, so close yet delightfully removed and world away from this nature escape.
we eschewed the three-hour hike up in favour of starting our visit sooner, gradually winding our way back down through the gardens - stopping every few minutes to enjoy the varied and wonderful fragrances of the herbs, flowers, leaves (""wow, come and smell this one!"") in the different and often themed garden areas.
unexpected features included an opportunity to create your own fragrant posy with dried herbs, petals and so on, and to make your own flower arrangement.
there's an expansive grassy area for children to play in, plenty of benches and tables to enjoy food you bought or brought, countless photo opportunities (i particularly liked the ""in the frame"" one, where you sit/pose in a large angled frame with a marigold-covered hill behind you).
so many wonderful experiences: i'm still smiling as i write this and recall our meander down to the mid-station where we got into the gondola to take us the rest of the way over the lower half of the hill.
somehow we missed the herbal footbath - ah well, a good reason to go back for another visit, perhaps during a different season.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Great ride up the hillside.,"Yes a really good place to visit, well worth the 1500円, nice to walk around with lots of interesting smells to smell.
Walked back down to the glass house, then caught lift back down.

You can spend 2-3 hours here, good place on a wet or sunny day.",

The gardens were amazing, due to timing give in another few weeks it would have been in full bloom and been specifically.","Written May 4, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Pleasant visit,We had a morning to spare in Kobe so we went on the ropeway up the Herb Garden. Lovely view of Kobe. It was a pleasant walk amongst the plants but to be honest nothing extraordinary. The highlight was the beautiful terrace overlooking the city and harbour. Here we enjoyed a lovely herbal tea on the sunny terrace.,"Written May 2, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Do Not Miss,"It is definitely worth a visit. The rope way up and the views are stunning. The flowers are everywhere and it is just so beautiful and relaxing. Stroll through the Gardens and check out the large variety of herbs.

Tulips in plenty all over and the restaurant and store are very nice too","Written May 1, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Relax,"Nice panorama on top of the hill. There are 2 stations where you'll ride until last station, then take a walk down to the mid station.",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Perfect half day in Kobe,"Situated near the southern exit from Shin Kobe station, the flowers and herbs beckon you to enter their enchanted world. Kobe Nunobiki Herb Garden is the most beautiful I’ve ever visited, requiring a cable car trip, about 8mins to reach the top station, then take in the stunning views of Port Kobe. There amidst the flowers and herb gardens, is nestled a museum of herbs, complete with gorgeous coffee shops and restaurants. Meander down the mountain passing glorious displays of herbs and flowers.....you’ll feel enlivened and calm. Take a hot spring foot bath (free). But bring a small towel (you can donate 100yen for a towel there though.
Continue down to the mid station, passing fountains, Asian herbs, tulips and a very large flower conservatory.
What a wonderful way to spend a few hours in Kobe, and build an appetite for some of their famous Kobe Beef!!
Entry including the cable car was 1500 yen return ticket.
I wouldn’t try to walk the return journey as it looks difficult, long, and a waste of valuable time which can be used visiting other delights of Kobe!",
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,For lovers of plants and flowers,"This garden on the mountainside is ideal for lovers of plants and flowers. It is best in the spring or the fall, in my opinion. It has easy walking paths between a large variety of plants and flowers. There is a ""ropeway"" cable car that is available to ride up the mountain, if you prefer, and then you can walk down through the paths of herbs and flowers. It does close early so best not to arrive later than about 3:30 p.m. if you really want to enjoy it to the fullest. There is a nice view of the city of Kobe from the top, as well as a gift shop.","Written April 29, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Spring has Sprung,"Plants, Ropeway, easy walk and food, all here. If you want a short hike then there is a steep walk either up or down (both if keen). The hike is supposed to be about 1 & 1/2 hours and would require suitable footwear.
We took the ropeway return. It takes you to the top point and after enjoying a lovely walk through well labelled gardens with many cafes and restaurants to choose from we ended at the mid point to return by the ropeway.
We had an excellent day with the weather and right time for the spring flowers. Leaflets available in more than one language including English.
Close to train station, so easy to find and again not far to walk. Many areas to look and smell the frangrances, herbs and spices. Plants bountiful and labelled. Lavender ice cream something different to try. As everywhere in Japan, clean, tidy, well signposted including in English. It can be very busy as a popular place for everyone, families, couples of all ages and friends. But we never felt a crush as big enough to spread out and the ropeway limits the number of passengers.
A lot of photo opportunities with stands for self timing cameras too.","Written April 29, 2018"
Japan,Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens,Worth a visit to Kobe,"Don’t be put off by the term ‘ herb garden’. These are beautifully designed and presented gardens that follow the contour of the hillside down the mountain behind the city of Kobe. The pathways and gardens are meticulously maintained and they are obviously planned so that there is something beautiful to look at during the different seasons.
In late April the tulips and azaleas were flowering but we could see how lavender and roses must become the main feature by summer. There are mature trees , herbaceous borders and flowering annuals throughout the garden.

At the glass house area is a free hot foot spa where you can dangles your tootsies before continuing on your walk. A small towel in your backpack would be handy!

If you like gardens don’t miss this beautiful place. It’s not the traditional Japanese garden but a very well designed modern one.",
