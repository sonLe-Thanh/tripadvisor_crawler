Germany,Reichstag Building,"A ""must"" on any tour to Berlin.","A building of such importance and with so much history. A must visit on any trip to Berlin.

However in these times of Covid there is one very important message to give and that is book early. If you see an on-line ""Visiting slot"" take it and sort the logistics out later. We could only secure a visit at 9.00 am on a Sunday morning, but were so glad we didn't hesitate.

For those who cannot book a tour, consider having a meal in the restaurant and using that as an opportunity to enter the building. An added bonus are the unrestricted views from the top of the building.

Finally if you do manage to hit the jackpot and get to visit then take time to carefully read what documentation / pre-registration is required. When we went they were strictly enforcing the rules and I am sure people are turned away.","Written October 19, 2021"

It was simply stunning. There was tons to eat, felt healthy as well as tasty, plus a glass of fizz included in the higher priced breakfast - well worth it. Spent 2 hours here.

Germany,Reichstag Building,Unfulfilling,"The building the SS presumably set on fire to instigate stricter measures against their opponents. Built about 50 years before WWII it has seen a lot of change. If you enter it, you can visit the roof, which offers both a view of the city, and the ability to look over the politicians at work inside the building, through the added glass dome.

It offers the opportuinity to reflect on whether Europe is moving forwards or backwards, and whether the Germans, who keeps trying to strenghten Europe by pushing for democratic erosion through the EU, is this time doing the right thing. Personally I think we have a long way to go before we see true transparancy in Europe.","Written October 6, 2020"

Germany,Reichstag Building,Historic,Beautiful and incredibly historical building that‚Äôs still the seat of the German parliament. Access to the glass rotunda is free but needs to be booked in advance. Likewise tours can be booked if you want to see the inside (and some soviet soldiers graffiti). Very close to the Brandenburg Gate with easy transport links around Berlin,
Germany,Reichstag Building,An ideal home of an ideal nation!,"It's worthy of being treated as an example of how a Parliament building should be, and probably it's a depiction of what the German Nation stands for. It's classy, dignified, and understated; it's modern, but with its classical roots; it's grand, but not ostentatious. But more than anything, it states 3 very critical aspects, conveniently forgotten by other governments: 1. Provides access to the common man (it's our/their Govt. dammit) 2. Transparency, the dome is made of glass and so is the ceiling of the parliament floor for all to see 3. The citizen is physically placed higher than the parliamentarians, clearly stating how the power should flow.

No wonder, this nation is where it is, in merely 6 decades after being decimated. Kudos!",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Visit the Top,The rotonda of the Reichstags Building is Always worth a visit. The view is very nice and you have plenty of photo opportunities,
Germany,Reichstag Building,Well worth the top spot,I made the mistake on a previous trip to Berlin by not booking in advance and was turned away at the door. Having this time booked several weeks in advance we turned up for an evening tour. The views from the top of the dome (both internal and across the city) are well worth adding this to your itinerary.,
Germany,Reichstag Building,The Dome by night,"While in Berlin end of August, I decided to visit the Dome. In order to avoid the crowd, I opted for a night visit and I did not regret it. First of all, you have to pre-book online in order to make sure you can get in (you still have the option to buy ticket at the entrance but you may not be always successful so in order to avoid any disappointment, better reserve online). One important thing: do not forget your ID. I went around 8.30 pm and the view at night is spectacular. Furthermore, there were few people and I could take nice picture. The view from the terrace is breathtaking. Norman Foster did an amazing job. A beautiful building and a free visit!",

Germany,Reichstag Building,Must see,"Stunning piece of architecture, not to mention all the historical significance this building has, nice surroundings to boot.","Written July 23, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,"Book ahead, as it doesn't always allow tours","Were could only see the outside of this amazing building. What great architecture, and amazing to see. Whilst it was rebuilt following the war is still has spender and gravitas.

You are able to go inside, if you book a tour, and go up the dome. It looks directly into the parliament itself and also I am advised there is somewhere to eat up the top.

Take the time to look ahead and book to get inside as we believe we have missed out, but failing that view the building from the outside to be astounded.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,The history of Berlin with an incredible outlook,"The building of the German Parliament has an interesting, rich history. You can book (do it in well advance!) a guided tour (obviously about the history of the building, how the parliament works, the occupation of the building in WW2) inside the building, or just visit the glass dome and enjoy the view of Berlin.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,A must see!,We loved visiting here - the 360 degrees view was incredible and the audio guide was fascinating. The queue also went down quite quickly. Definitely worth a visit.,"Written July 15, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Overlook Berlin from the glass dome,"Reichstag is a must see while visiting Berlin. Plan ahead to book your ticket online or plan to wait a long line to get tickets. The modern glass dome on the classic building is incredible beautiful. From both inside and outside of the dome, we can see the view of Berlin. The building houses the German Parliament. We can learn some history from photographs inside of the dome.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,An excellent view of Berlin!,"We visited the Reichstag on invitation of my cousin who lives in Berlin. You have to pre book your visit online and submit passport details of you are not a German citizen, no worries around this.

To enter, you must first make it through an airport style security hall. I had my grandmother in a wheelchair and they made it very accommodating for her. We were taken personally to the lift due to having to go through some security critical areas. Once there, we were loaded into the lift first before we picked up a lot more people in the floor above. The lift then takes you directly to the top dome.

The views were excellent and you receive a free audio guide to talk you through what you can see. There is a very long spiral walkway up to the top and the audio guide is designed to know where you are on that walkway, then giving you information about the building and the views beyond.

At the top there is a viewing platform where you can rest and view the sights. Then follow the other spiral walkway which takes you back down, again, the audio guide is giving you timely information.

Overall, this is a wonderful place to visit, i would even pay for the privilege, but the fact it was free made it even better!",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Book online in advance,THis is a must see while visiting Berlin. Don't forget to book your ticket online in advance or you may not be able to visit the building. The glass dome is incredible.,"Written April 27, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Can't believe it's free!,"Book in advance to secure your spot and you'll be grateful you did. The view of the city from the top is fantastic (we went 09:45 in early Feb and were lucky to have clear skies), and I love the fact that the public have a view down into the chambers.

Definitely use the free audio guide on offer (it comes in lots of languages) and take time to really look at the photos and information on display. My husband and I learnt a lot.","Written April 24, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Impressive Building,Even just to stand outside and admire the architecture is a good experience. The building survived the war but was not allowed to be used as a parliament building until after the Cold War ended.,
Germany,Reichstag Building,Worth doing,You should probably include the Bundestag when visiting Berlin for the grandeur of it's architecture for an hour or so,"Written April 20, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,"Book in advance, I guess!","We arrived in Berlin, and decided at the last minute to visit the Reichstag building. We had not booked in advance. I checked online and saw that there was ONE slot left! 9:45PM. We took it. When I checked back the next day I saw that the next possible visit was 2 weeks away, so do what we did at your own risk. Glad we got to go.

The building was interesting to visit as it has a lot of history, including its burning as the Nazis came to power. Great view from the top and the glass dome. You can also walk around their exhibit and see the history of the building.","Written April 9, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,"Beautiful, Must Visit",Important tip : Register for free in advance to visit the Dome of the Reichstag. I would recommend starting your trip to Berlin by a visit to the Reichstag first. Easy to get to by the metro. Spectacular views and information of history .,
Germany,Reichstag Building,"I found this to be one of the more surprising things to do in Berlin, and I‚Äôm sure you will too!","The Reichstag Building is the current home of the German Parliament, and as such, boasts a prime location on the banks of the River Spree. Over the years, it‚Äôs survived Nazi rule, wars, bombings, the country‚Äôs division and even a fire. In 1933, only four weeks after Hitler‚Äôs rise to power, the Reichstag Building was subject to a mysterious arson attack and almost destroyed by flames. Following the fire, the police conducted a search and accused a Dutch council communist of starting it. He was arrested, as were four communist leaders soon after. Hitler then urged the president to pass an emergency degree, which led to the mass arrests of the entire Communist Party of Germany and left the Nazi Party unchallenged. This enabled Hitler to consolidate his power.

The Reichstag Building‚Äôs present-day appeal, however, lies on its roof rather than its history. The large glass dome offers visitors a 360-degree view of the surrounding Berlin cityscape. Mirrors integrated in the dome reflect natural light and illuminate the parliamentary chamber below. From an architectural standpoint, it‚Äôs unique and seemingly futuristic. From a photography standpoint, it‚Äôs very visually pleasing and many of you will find different and creative ways of capturing it.

I visited during the day and found it breath-taking. I read online that after dark it‚Äôs even better! The dome is free to visit but an online registration needs to be filled out and submitted prior to your arrival.","Written April 1, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,A bucket list item done!,"There is so much information to absorb on a visit, you really need to have a guide, ours was excellent and easy going, there was the odd dumb question from the group but they were dealt with in a polite and courteous manner. Its an amazing building and experience, make sure to bring photo id or you won't get in!","Written April 1, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,"Don't come just for a photo, take a tour - but book well in advance","The Reichstag is a main edifice of the Bundestag - the German Parliament (the lower house) in the very city center, 5 min walk from the Brandenburg gate. It's a remarkable bldg with a significant history, so seeing only the exterior is far from enough for any serious traveller. Therefore, I recommend booking a tour of it.
And, I suggest doing that as soon as possible - beware, it fills up quickly.
The process is very easy on the Bundestag website, it's totally free and you can do that for 3 months in advance. There are several options to choose from, but I recommend a guided tour followed by the Dome visit.
Have in mind, you cannot either climb the Dome without prebooking and written confirmation (you can take your chance by queuing outside if they have spaces left, but why should you do that when you can arrange everything with no stress).
You book a date and a time slot (you have an option to name 3 of them that best suit you, and you'll be assigned one of them). You have to be there 30 min prior the assigned time WITH a PRINTED voucher (confirmation). Be prepared for airport style security.
The tour lasts around 90 min during which you must not leave your guide. It's very informative and interesting and you visit various parts of the Bundestag. Best part is naturally the Reichstag main debate room where the Parliament meets with the enormous eagle, designed by a Dutch architect. Beside that you're taken to other parts of Bundestag via underground hallways, like the part where're the member's offices across the library (which is the third largest in the world) and visit the small drawers hall where are drawers of all Parliament members through history with the exemption of the Nazi period whose drawer is black. The only thing I doubt being authentic are the Soviet soldier's graffiti when they captured the bldg - they look too fresh for a 75 years period.
After the tour you're left on your own to admire and climb the fabulous glass Dome and enjoy the views from the Reichstag terrace.
Count on around 2-2,5 hrs for the entire experience, which is really a must do in Berlin and absolutely free.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Worth Visiting,I was totally blown away by this building. If you like architecture then you‚Äôre bound to be moved by this. It‚Äôs almost out of this world. Take time to climb to the top.,"Written March 18, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,A must visit for anyone visiting Berlin,We were unsure what to expect with this tour but were blown away by the experience. After having visited the Capitol and White House in DC we expected this tour to be similar but could not have been more wrong. The building was rebuilt to be contemporary yet also historical at the same time. Having the guided tour is very worth the effort as you are able to get a true sense of the ideology and ask all the questions you didn't even know you would have. The building and governmental system represents a shift of the mindset that is truly unique. The design specifically addresses the atrocities of the past and their commitment to never repeat them. A must on anyone visiting Berlin.,"Written March 18, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,A proud parliamentary building,"A mixture of renaissance and post modern architecture, the building stands proud and restored. Beautiful!",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Guided Tour (Inside),"You have to book in advance vis their website. It was a very interesting and informative tour. The various stages of German history and the relationship to the building was very well explained, as was the make up of the current parliament.
Inside the building is very plain, but has kept a lot of its historical features eg the Russian Graffiti from the second world war. Unfortunately was unable to visit dome as it was closed as a precaution (Covid - 19).
Well with it.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,"Unbelievable late night, after dinner visit to the top of the dome of the Reichstag","We had enjoyed a wonderful dinner at the K√§fer roof top restaurant at the Reichstag building one Monday back in February and afterwards went on to explore the glass dome of this iconic building. It was well after 10 o'clock in the evening and we virtually had the place to ourselves. We had time to read all about the history of the building before slowly walking upwards & around in a spiral towards the very top. The nighttime views of Berlin were fantastic.

I was fascinated by the large mirrored cone in the centre of the dome which apparently directs sunlight into the building. It cleverly allow views right the way down to the main debating chamber a long way below. And I learned that the whole idea of allowing the public access above the debating chamber was to symbolize that people are above the German Government - this certainly wasn't the case during the Nazi years. And the futuristic design of the dome, created by the British architect Norman Foster was designed to herald a departure from Nazism to a modern, reunified Germany.

At that time of night there were hardly any other visitors - just numerous security staff who were more than willing to chat and explain things. I didn't realise, for example that there is no roof at the top of the glass dome - it is open to the elements right up there.

All in all this felt like a private visit to one of the most significant landmarks in Berlin, probably Germany and possibly the world. Unforgettable!!!",
Germany,Reichstag Building,"Booked for next day, arrived, they closed it, so no entry","We booked this Monday at the booking office opposite, for an early Tuesday afternoon visit, on arrival on Tuesday at our allotted time, were told they had closed it the previous day for the day of our visit. It would have been useful if they had taken an email address when we booked, at the time of booking, as it messed our days plans up","Written March 11, 2020"

Germany,Reichstag Building,Interesting Free Tour / Must Pre-Book,"I prebooked the free tour a couple weeks before my trip in January and had no problem getting my first choice of time/date. I was in Berlin for a week in January and the weather was unseasonably warm and clear for my visit; with the exception of the day of my Reichstag tour. It was a cloudy, drizzly, and cold morning when I arrived at the security checkpoint. My tour time was one of the first that morning and there was no waiting; I went right in and went through the airport style security check. From there, a group of tourists was escorted inside the building and to the lift. At the top of the elevator, there is a counter where they hand out the audio guides (the audio activates automatically at different points in the dome). The audio tour is interesting. You can walk around the roof area as well as go up the circular ramp to the top of the dome. It is an impressive building with an interesting history and on clear days, you get a great view of Berlin. The prebooking makes it difficult to plan your visit around the weather (the day before was a picture-postcard, beautiful-blue-cloudless-skies day.
There is a cafe on the roof which can also be prebooked and there are public toilets near the audio guide counter/lifts.","Written March 9, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Make sure you book!,"My partner and I visited The Reichstag when we took a surprise trip to Berlin. As we didn‚Äôt know we were coming to Berlin, we had to research everything when we arrived. Luckily, we researched the Reichstag as you HAVE TO BOOK TO GO IN THE GLASS DOME!!!

It‚Äôs free to book, and we were lucky going in January as I believe it would‚Äôve been harder to book a day or two in advance if it was a busier time.

The Reichstag was incredibly interesting and it was very secure (as expected) but it didn‚Äôt feel rushed looking around. Once inside, you had as much or little time as you wanted to explore the glass dome.

I would say, don‚Äôt go on a rainy day as we couldn‚Äôt look outside as much as we would‚Äôve liked! However, it was a lovely and educational experience.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Treasured experience,"I think many people do not know that they can book in advance and visit the dome for free. I sure didn't, but I'm glad my friend did! We got to see the views and lights of Berlin at night during Christmas market season. (You book to visit during a specific time frame). This is one of the coolest experiences I have had in Europe overall. I had no idea people could enter the dome so it was an amazing surprise when my friend told me she had planned it for us.","Written March 9, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Book early to avoid disappointment,"My wife and I tried to visited the reichstag a couple of years ago was blissfully unaware at the time of the requirement to book in advance, so was disappointed to find that we couldn‚Äôt enter.

I planned ahead this time and booked just under 2 months in advance (just google reichstsg tickets and follow the official link - tickets are free). Well worth the 5-10 minutes that it takes to apply if you book early enough and your desired date/time slot is still available .

On arrival have your letter of invitation (this will be emailed to you) and official ID such as passport or drivers licence with you. Airport style security will provide entry to this building with a huge amount of history behind it.

Free audio tour head sets available in a variety of languages at the top of the lift. I won‚Äôt spoil the rest of it... Enjoy.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Beware of early morning slot - the windows may still be misted up obscuring views,"The dome is a spectacular building and there is a lot of interesting information at its base.
We were provided with clear English audio guides to support our tour up and down the dome.
We booked a few days in advance and confirmed names for the second part of the booking process and this all went smoothly.
The early time slot and cold weather meant that the glass surrounding the dome remained very misted and difficult to see our of.","Written March 8, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Well organised,"We went to this building in December. Since we had no pre booking; we booked at their kiosk across the street.
The place is well organised with high level security.
We were escorted to the glass dome were we received automatic voice guide headsets
The guides were so informative and we learnt a lot.
We had our 8 year old and toddler on stroller.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Shocking staff!!!!,"The view was amazing we had a great time up until we were leaving. My sister and I had asked a security guy who was not busy, simply talking to his colleagues which way the exit was. He shouted aggressively the exit is that way. Then he stomped over to us turned the exit sign (which was faced the wrong way) around slamming it down onto the floor throwing an actual tantrum like a toddler! He turned the sign which was still facing the wrong way and glared at us. Walked off to his friends and spoke about us in their own language. We were completely shocked and it really ruined our whole night. He was one of three at the desk by the lift, we visited on 7th March 2020 at 9.30pm. It was disgusting how we were treated! We all have bad days but don‚Äôt bring it to work.","Written March 7, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Great architecture and views,"You have to be shepherded in through security and up to the dome in large groups, which is a bit of a pain, but once up there you can take your time admiring (and gently climbing) the Richard Rodgers-designed dome and checking out the 360 degree views. Loved it.","Written March 7, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Disturbing lift experience,"Ok nothing special but the lift experience will stay with me forever - for all the wrong reasons .
We booked for the 09:45 session
Security was smooth and easy... then the lift up to the dome
The lift was very full then they squeezed more and more people in - after a visit to the Holocaust memorial I found this very very disturbing
The dome itself was ok nothing special ( nice view of Berlin) , the cafe a bit posh ( more restaurant than cafe)
But will always remember the visit for the horrendous lift experience","Written March 6, 2020"

Book well in advance otherwise a long queue. . My Berlin friend booked for us both to go. A passport is required, you take this around all the time in Germany so dont forget it now. Staff are efficient and kind.. Non German citizens cannot go into the Parliament hall. The Cupola is our target.

Germany,Reichstag Building,Make the reservation!,We got a late appointment and it was a rainy night so we almost didn't go. We were glad we did as it is such an interesting architectural structure.

Just make sure you sign up for entry a few weeks before so that there are spaces available. It was quick to get into. The security were a bit rude in terms of not speaking to us properly but I guess that is what you get when you are going into a government building.

There are information panels giving you a good overview of how the building sits at the heart of German history. The free audio guide kicks in as you walk up the dome describing all the landmarks of Berlin. You can walk around the roof too.

All in all an essential part of a visit to Berlin and even better it is totally free.","Written February 28, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Iconic and fun with a gourmet surprise on the top!!!!,"It's iconic and represents German determination and resilience. It is a symbol of retaking the promising past of Berlin, which was an important cosmopolitan progressive cultural center and an important city for many ""firsts"" in LGBTQ history in particular, away from the dark presence of a very sinister era. The dome is beautiful and it's fun to go to the very top (it seems). I couldn't do it as I was too tired after walking two days in Paris, then two days in Vienna.... The view is gorgeous. Keep in mind that you should make a reservation to go in during the high season especially. Very annoyingly, you need to go through a security checkpoint and it takes forever to get up to the top. It's far worse than the same experience at the airport. I was here in the low season and it was bad. Be prepared! If you are going to K√§fer, the really great restaurant at the top, make sure you make a reservation and arrive with much time in advance due to the security nuisance which will make you very late if you dont take it into consideration.",

Once through security you get escorted up to the dome. You are given an audio guide in your language which is cleverly done. The audio guide gets triggered at certain points as you work your way up and back down the dome. Helpful for pointing out landmarks and giving you the history of the building. Great views out over the city and a lovely view of the Brandenburg gate. Definitely worth doing.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,A must visit,"We visited on a lovely late afternoon as the sun was setting. After security checks (including passports), we were escorted to the entrance of the main parliament building and up the lift to the impressive dome. Slowly winding your way round the interior ramp of this modern landmark, right to the top, is a treat. Take in the city views and the architectural wonder of the chrome and glass, and enjoy the circular opening at the top that connects you back to the great outdoors and hopefully blue Berlin skies. Book in advance for this refreshingly free visit. We got lucky and popped into the quietish restaurant for a reasonably-priced latte and huge cake between us!",

In addition to walking to the top of the glass dome, you can also walk along the roof top. There are multiple views of the city. There were not big crowds.

Germany,Reichstag Building,A must-see!,"The tour of the Reichstag Dome is a ‚Äòmust-see‚Äô when in Berlin. Visiting at night provides a particularly peaceful experience, not to mention a free view of Berlin‚Äôs skyline lit up.

You will need to book a tour in a small white hut next to the restaurant on the street opposite the building, using your passport. These fill up quickly but can usually be booked on the day. I managed to secure a space on a 21:00-22:00 tour when queuing to register at 18:00pm. This can seem like a bit of a hassle but is definitely worth it.

Small groups are then taken to the top of the building in a lift, where you are free to read information plaques at the bottom of the dome, or stroll to the top of the dome via the spiral staircase that lines the building. Notably, this is accessible and wheelchair friendly. Audio guides are also available but are not necessary unless you would particularly like the extra information a tour guide can provide.

There is also freedom to walk across the roof of the Reichstag, however very few people choose to do this in winter due to cold winds.

If you only want a quick tour, it is easy to be in and out of the building within 20 minutes, however exploring the building at a leisurely pace is a far more rewarding experience. There is also no pressure to leave at the end of your allotted hour, although this may differ in busy periods.",

Brilliant free thing to do whilst visiting Berlin! Security was good and you needed to bring your confirmation and a form of I.d with you.

The second security checkpoint had a metal detector and strict security procedures. We then took the elevator up to the base of the dome. We then walked up a circular ramp to the very top of the dome. The views of Berlin were fantastic as well as of the roof of the Reichsag Building.

The reichstag is a very popular place to go so I recommend you take time to wait in line to go up. They only allow a certain number of visitors at one time and the security is tight because it‚Äôs the Bundestag, their congress. TIP: If you make a reservation at ‚ÄúK√§fer‚Äù online, you will be expedited to the dome. The restaurant isn‚Äôt cheap but worthwhile.

You get there, receive a audio guide, take the elevator (quite big one) and go up to see the building from above. You can take a look inside from up there as well. It's nice that you get a beep on your audio guide once you reach a particular point on your walking, it tells you where to look at and also tells you the history of that particular spot. The view is pretty nice and you must register it.
The only down moment for me was on the lawn in front of the building, where I had to carefull dismiss an attempt from two girls that were asking for money.

If you can plan a visit, it will be worth it, but if you only want the views, you can get those from Berliner Dome, without prior planning. Reichstag visit is free, but a reservation is needed and it has a specific time slot so you have to plan your day around it. Arrive earlier because there's airport type security. Don't forget to get the audio guide (also free) because without it it's less impressive.

In January we were able to book for later that day although we opted to book a slot for the next morning. Be aware there is a high level of security and it‚Äôs rather daunting as you need to get into a large glass lift and are packed in!
We went after visiting the Jewish museum and also after reading about personal stories from the holocaust and the horror of being packed into trucks and huts ( in preparation for the atrocities to take place) it seemed rather ironic that we all happily allowed ourselves to be herded into the lift in the same way!!

Germany,Reichstag Building,Impressive,"I recommend reserving a time to enter the Reichstag early in your Berlin stay, your time slot could be several hours or the following day (you choose based on availability). The process is simple, easy, moves fast, results in minimal lines and prevents overcrowding. Once in you get all the time you want so go as fast or slow as you wish.

Walking up into the glass dome your audio highlights different parts of the city, sites, monuments, history, and the operation of the German government. I used to plan some visits later in my trip as well as getting and enjoyable overview of the city and country.

Time of day to visit, that is the question, several people I spoke to recommend dusk. On this visit I went in the evening on a misty night so the views were not as spectacular but the dome takes on a different character at night. Bottom line there is no wrong time of day.

Very enjoyable.",

Germany,Reichstag Building,Fascinating building and brilliantly set up tour,"First things first, you can't just turn up. You need to go online and prebook, and provide them with name, dob, etc of everyone in your party - once you get there there is also airport style security, this is their government building after all!
It's a brilliant place and lots to learn.
The lift takes you up to the glass dome at the top of the building, which has a walkway that gently goes round and up to the very top. While you go up, your audio guide picks up where you are and tells you about what you can see - all VERY clever!
As well as information about what buildings you can see, you also learn something of how the building works, eg the mirrors down the middle of the dome reflecting light down into the room below - also VERY clever!
Highly recommend it",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Very interesting,First thing to note is that you must apply to visit in advance and you need to take ID with you. Don‚Äôt let this put you off. The view from the dome is awesome. We went after dark and seeing the city lit up was lovely however the commentary is slightly harder to follow as you can‚Äôt necessarily see the landmarks identifying features that it tells you to look out for.

It also introduces some of the main concepts that it is important to grasp if you want to start to understand the unique history of Berlin. The important thing to remember is that you must book an appointment online in advance and then when you arrive at the reception area be able to show photo ID to gain admission. Once you have been through security you will be taken as part of a group to enter the building and up in a lift to the roof terrace. On the terrace you can collect an audio guide. You enter the dome. In the centre there is a presentation which explains the origin of the German state, the Reichstag and Bunderstag, the rise of national socialism, the division of Germany and the development of the new building by Norman Foster. You can then walk up the ramp and as you proceed the audio guide tells you more and indicates the various important city landmarks. On a good day you can see for miles. Once at the top you can also look down and may be able to see the Bundestag in session. You leave by walking down a second ramp. We also went to the restaurant which is on the roof terrace. It is not the cheapest place to eat but it is lovely. Some people just had a hot drink.",

At any rate, all the images we'd had in our heads went right out the window the second we stepped out of the Bahnhof and saw the millions of Christmas Market stalls in our faces.

NOT that I'm complaining! I was in Christmas Market heaven.

We visited Marienplatz several times over the course of our five-day stay. It was crowded - except for early in the morning, which was my favorite time to visit.

We did visit some of the ""local"" type stores on the Platz, but avoided the chains we know from home. It was easy to get lost and turned around with all the stalls and the side streets, but it was an amazing adventure.

Marienplatz served as a kind of ""home base"" for us while we were in Munich. It was comfortable, had a good variety of restaurants and shops, and had a wonderful vibe. I loved the history and the architecture, and how central it all was.

I would love to go back in another season, to visit the Platz without the market stalls (did I really say that?), and to see the area in sun and warmth. To, you know, see it as it was depicted in Gabriel Knight. Nerd alert!",

Despite being full of people on Christmas Eve we never felt and danger of being pickpocketed, unlike similar places in different cities, but caution is - as always - advised.

Get off the main street and about a block behind the New Town Hall, and by the cathedral, there are some very good and reasonably priced restaurants which are full of locals. Always a good sign as often centrally located restaurants in tourist areas are bad and expensive.

During December, you can also enjoy the annual Christmas market here at Marienplatz. There is a giant Christmas tree setup in the middle of the square, which is filled with stalls selling traditional and season foods, mulled wine as well as Christmas ornaments, decorations and other items of interest. The holiday market provides a good way to spend another hour or so at and around Marienplatz while in addition to intended sightseeing endeavours you have in the area.",

Germany,Marienplatz,Go for the Christmas Market,"The Marienplatz is transformed during late November and December to a wonderful Christmas market, with stands set up to buy handmade Christmas ornaments and gifts, and to sell street food and the special ‚ÄúGluhwein‚Äù or spiced, hot red wine. In the Christmas season the Gluhwein is a ‚Äúmust do‚Äù activity - on a cold evening buy a little ceramic cup of the hot liquid (8 Euro - but you get 4 back when you return the cup). It‚Äôs not as extensive as the larger Christmas markets in, for example, Nuremberg, but it is also not as crowded and you get a little bit of everything here!",
Germany,Marienplatz,Purely commercial.,"I don‚Äôt know what we were expected but hoped to be imbued with the Christmas spirit. But sadly we found it generally lacking. There were numerous stalls generally selling over-priced decorations, sausages and mulled wine. Despite the huge crowds, there was a total lack of Christmas music or charity. Even our small local mall manages to give you the Salvation Army brass band playing carols. Where were the choirs or German oompah bands in Munich?

Since we had never visited as a couple, or during December, we made the choice to stay to visit the Christmas markets. While Munich was wonderful, the markets were a complete waste of time. Maybe I had the wrong expectation, but I was expecting a cute market with lots of lovely local foods and local craft stalls. Man, was I wrong!
It was all cheap stuff or pre-packaged goods you might finds anywhere. What a waste of our time!

We could barely see the booths because of the people standing in front of them, not moving, not buying, just standing there. I keep hearing about how Christmas markets are ‚Äúmagical‚Äù.

Germany,Marienplatz,Christmas Market 2010,"This review is based on the Christmas Market Marienplatz as opposed the the place alone.

The main square offers a huge array of stalls with crafts and other festive items to buy. But I'd say about 75% of the stalls are food and drink. They operate a fun method if getting gl√ºhwein, with each stall offering a different style of drink container, from a simple cup with a winter marienplatz scene on it, to a ceramic boot! All the stalls will top up any drinking vessel. You can return your cup for your refund back or keep the item for a souvenir.

The square itself offers a great background with all of its historic buildings and the giant Christmas tree looks as festive as you can get at night.

Its quieter during the day so if you want an easier life looking round, go during the day for shopping, and then head back at night to simply soak it (and gl√ºhwein) up! Be sure to visit the near by medieval market too as this offers extra activities, drinking vessels and foods not found in the square!",

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,A must-see on a trip to Hamburg,"The Miniatur Wunderland is not only Hamburg¬¥s most famous attraction, but is also regularly voted as Germany¬¥s Top 1 place to visit.

To be honest I didn‚Äôt expect much before my visit and thought I will just take a small round, as I am not a big fan of model trains. But this place is so much more than a museum of model trains. What has actually started small is nowadays the biggest model railway system in the world according to the Guinness-Book.

The museum is divided into different country and theme areas and lighting will change periodically from daylight to night-time. What I found most fascinating is the indescribable love for details. Every single person or thing in the display reflects 100% reality. You really have to see it, as words can¬¥t do justice. For a visit I would at least plan for around 2-3 hours, actually you could spend the whole day in there. If you like to know more about my visit to there, see also on traveltreasuresbymarion",

The exhibition areas spread over 3 floors had many halls with model railway sets representing different countries & regions such as Austria, Middle Germany, Hamburg, Italy, Knuffingen, Scandinavia, Switzerland, Venice, America, etc. We were really impressed with painstakingly detailed miniaturized railroads and Hamburg airport scenes. While walking around, we faced recurring blackouts to show alternating day and night scenes. Over 2 hour period, we could see only a fraction of the world‚Äôs largest miniature wonderland in this establishment.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Didn't like it at all.,"This place is overcrowded, so it is impossible to really enjoy looking at anything.

Some of the models are more complex than others, and might present some fascination in terms of their elaborate constructions, but fundamentally this is like paying for the privilege to enter a can of sardines.

It's just awful and best avoided.","Written August 28, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Such detail ... allow at least 2hours,"First time visit for us. Amazing detail in all displays.
Scenes from America, Germany, Hamburg itself, Austria, Italy & Switzerland.
Airport scene the star of the exhibition.
With social distancing measures in place takes a while to patiently get around, and you need to pre-book a time slot.
Best allow minimum of 2 hours though you could spend much longer.","Written August 21, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Like always incredible,We booked a tour to see everything around there. Our guide was very friendly and showed us around. Even though of corona it was a nice trip through the world. The system wasn‚Äôt too nasty. It doesn‚Äôt matter how often you go there you always explore a new story.,

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazing with something for everyone!,"This is my third time visiting Miniatur Wunderland and each time I am amazed at the breadth, scope, and attention-to-detail found here. The ""Find This"" game in the brochure ws especially fun and really encouraged us to look carefully in each location so that we could find the scene that was pictured. Having the lights dim and brighten to show the passage of time is clever, especially when the traffic lights transition to just blinking during the nighttime and then working again once it is daytime again.

This was my first visit with kids (5 and 3 years old) and they were entranced. We spent more than 3 hours there; they especially loved seeing the shuttle take off in Florida and looking for Santa in Sweden. My husband and I could have been there for longer, but their attention started to lag at the 3-hour mark. This is a place that I highly recommend to anyone traveling to Hamburg -- it is definitely worth a visit!","Written August 4, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Superb visit,"I really really love the Miniature land. I can spend hours and hours watching the landscape, people, buildings, situations and hidden funny findings.
It is great for kids, adults, old. Everyone will like this.
I will probably visit once every 3-4 year.
I dont post photos of this, since there is so many already.","Written July 29, 2020"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Impressive miniature world-travel,"This place is definetly worth a visit, bith with/without kids. Placed in one of the old buildings near the harbour, you find this very ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù tourist attraction. It is an amazing travel through a lot of countries, with incredible details and a lot of small stories going on in the landscape if you look closely. It is both a fun and different tourist experience, but do take the time to discover the details, and get impressed by the many hours of work that lies behind it! Remember to book your tickets good time ind advance, and TAKE YOUR TIME to see it all. Not a place that you should rush thru. We were about 2 hours and 15 minutes to see it all, and we didnt see everything.

The ‚Äúworld‚Äù consists of a lot of Germany, but they are still building new countries. Take your time to read the little notes, that will tell you a lot about the things you see.","Written July 21, 2020"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazed and bewitched,"I have not expected so many details, colours, funny ideas, romantic ways of exposing the beauty of the nature and the cities. It is definitely on the top of my museum list! It is for a few-hours-long visit. For young and old ;)",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,"Fantastic, even though you are not into miniature trains....","It's amazing how many man-hours they have put into this and even though I am not a big fan of model trains, this place has been created down to the last details and if you look closely there are a lot of hidden humoristic gems ....",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazing experience and must-see in Hamburg!,I‚Äôve visited the Miniatur Wunderland for the 3rd time now and it is fantastic how I still found some amazing details and funny easter eggs everywhere (even though I spend hours there the first two times). It is just crazy detailed and one can see that people are not building the model for money or prestige but for passion!,"Written July 13, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Must-see when in Hamburg,"The other reviews certainly weren't wrong.

Wonderland markets itself as the world's largest model railway. But it's so much more. A true to detail miniature replica of many places including Hamburg the airport with actual flight movements, Austria, Venice, Switzerland, soon Monaco (it's under building as of July 2020).

One can easily spend 3 hrs here, even though the exhibits dont cover that big an area.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,"In the details you""ll find more joy","It""s honestly too much to take in for one day. The airport alone can be enjoyed for hours on end. If you walk through and see the overall construction you""ll have a great time as scenes change between day and night, but, if you take a closer look you""ll notice a lot more detail like a murder scene, ET flying home, and a couple having sex in their apartment :)
Most people don""t spend the time to examine the hard work that goes into building something like this, but it's worth it.","Written June 16, 2020"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Fantastic Place,"This is absolute fantastic and unique place. Its real world of many another small worlds. We bought the tickets online before 2 weeks. And the only time slot was 23:00.
Tickets redemption was good and easy, but 1 hr was really not enough to see all the expo. Guess that we saw only 10-15% of all the installations.
I wish i can get back very soon. Can recommend this place to everyone!","Written May 12, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Defenitely worth the visit,"Great, we spent more than 4 hrs in there. Next time again, I am sure we still missed a lot. Fair price.
The only ""but"": we were there on a rainy February Friday and there were ""enough"" people. Can not imagine how crowded it would be on a sunny Satureday.","Written March 27, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Very good attraction,"This is an amazing place. Very busy but that‚Äôs a good sign of how popular it is. The models are breathtaking in their scale and detail and are presented so well with changing light and interaction.
Super for families and kids as well.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Just brilliant,"If you like this sort of thing, this will blow your socks off. Even if you don't - go and take a look anyway. It's fascinating, impressive and funny. Given the work that has gone it, it is worth the entrance price several times over. Even liked the cafe (carriage) for a beer afterwards. Just go, if you can....","Written March 14, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Really impressed!,"First of all, the museum impressed me the magnitude of hard work of those who participated in it's creation: in 9 rooms you can see entire cities and lands in miniature with day and night light simulating, intertwined by the railways and the roads. Everything moves, sometimes accompanied by sound signals. Most of all I liked Hamburg in miniature. There are a lot of visitors, so it is best to choose the earliest or latest time. The bus numero 6 goes to the Wunderland from the city center and the main train station to the final stop.","Written March 8, 2020"

Use public transport to get there and bring plenty of time as there is so much detail going on!! Day, night, trains, ports, mountains, cities, planes, etc - very impressive! Suggest you go as late as possible (pm) if you can. The place gets insanely crowded during the regular hours. Spend some time in the souvenir shop afterwards, great stuff and good value for money! Great place overall!!",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Not so wunder,I liked the feature to buy tickets and a timeslot in advance. But I had expected more activity trainwise. The transition from day to night was amazing.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Impresive but crowded,"By the time I got there, it was pretty empty but after an hour or so, it got really really crowded. I would recommend to visit early in the morning if possible, to avoid waiting in order to see the cities and constructions. I would say that, if you enjoy the collection and want to see it all (in detail) you need almost 3h . Cities are represented by day/by night (which was very impressive - also wait to see volcanic eruption, thunderstorm and many more).
Ticket price was 15.50 euros online (someone purchased it for me in Germany). I'm still not sure why for the same ticket the price shown on my phone was 18.50 euros.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Very impressive but over crowded,"I have big respect of the people making this Miniature Wonderland happening.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Miniatur Wundeeland,It is not good place for people with claustrophobia. Too many people in one place. Miniatures are interesting but I missed there more interaction and natural materials.,
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Lives up to expectations,"This is much more than a model railway - it's a miniature world!
Regions included are Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Scandinavia and America.
One suggestion for improvement: take out America and put in Britain. This is where railways started, it's in Europe (more in keeping with the theme) and is the home of wonderful heritage railways that could, in part, be modelled. The British also make-up the largest number of visitors from a country not covered by the modelling.","Written February 24, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazing place,"Excellent place. We spent around 3 hours here and probably could have spent longer. The models are awesome and we especially loved it when the light dimmed to see the models ‚Äúat night‚Äù. We visited the cafe for lunch which was delightful and loved the seating (as if you were on a train).
It‚Äôs so hard to describe the detail that is put into these displays without having seen it. It‚Äôs just spectacular. I‚Äôd recommend a visit and we will return as they were constructing another two lands whilst there and would love to see them once finished",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazing!,"I thought I would be bored after an hour. But the details, funny quirks (ET in a bicycle half way up a mountain!), interactive buttons, the daytime changing into night every half (?) hour. Watch a palace break into fire (smoke coming from the roof, flames through the windows) then the fire engines are despatched to combat the fire. We spent 6 hours here and would have gone back the next day if I could. Attention to detail was amazing! Cafe food reasonable prices too!","Written February 23, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Incredible detail - unmissable,The attention to detail is incredible - I spent three hours here and could have stayed all day. This is by far the best attraction of its type I've ever been to. To call it a model railway doesn't do it justice.,
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,You must see !!!,"I come to Hamburg few times but i didn‚Äôt have time to visit. But i am so happy i had this time a chance to visit this time. Its a great great place. There is really harf work on it. You like going to your childhood. All the miniature city‚Äôs, trains , cars , people, buildings, everything perfect.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Fantastic attraction,If you visit Hamburg this place is a must visit attraction. I‚Äôve seen models before but nothing like these. The details are unbelievable. The models with the planes taking off and landing are brilliant. It‚Äôs not just about the models the technology to have so many working vehicles and trains is something else. We were in there three hours and could have stayed longer and only 15 euros per person,"Written February 18, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Fun but full,"We looked in the website for the waiting times and went on the moment it said 0 minutes which was absolutely correct and saved us ‚Ç¨5 by not having to book a fast lane ticket. The miniature cities and countries were very beautiful, detailed, funny with little hidden easter eggs and interesting to see. Especially the airport really was amazing to see! It was very full at the beginning so it was sometimes hard to see everything or the get in front to push the buttons. But later it was calmer and we got to see things better. We spent around 2 hours here and it was worth the money. I must say though that it was an experience that I will not do again. It was great, yes, but also a bit ""boring"" after a while because at the end it is the same all the time. I would recommend it to families with kids. For adults that are not that much into railways or miniature things it can be bit boring.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Fantastic for children,"It was very crowded and difficult to get a good luck at some exhibits, some people just stand like statues unable to move. It is clever, especially the airport. Was sad not to see France or Uk represented.","Written February 17, 2020"

All the details are perfect and you can see also how it works since there are cuts in the wood. It is also very interactive for kids: in each place there are push buttons to see something moving or turning on lights. Every 15 minutes, you can also see the places in the night, with all the lights and traffic. Truck and car traffic is perfect designed: traffic lights, truck curves, stops, everything.","Written February 17, 2020"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,The best attraction in Hamburg,If you visit Hamburg and want see just one thing you have to go to Miniatur Wunderland especially if you have children with you it would be terrible if you miss it. The attraction is well organized but I'd advise to find the time to go there when it is not very crowded and book your tickets online. There are free lockers for your valuables and inside the attraction area a locker for charging your phones!!!!!!,

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,First Class,I have been wanting to go here for many years and went with my grown up son in January. We were not disappointed - what a fabulous experience. Exceeded all our high expectations - so much detail and such a huge three stories high extensive and amazing set of layouts with over 17 km of track. The airport terminal is AMAZING. Would return again gladly - so much to see. It was better towards end of the evening when crowds were thinning. We flew for the day with Ryanair from Stansted. Would suggest you go for more than a day - such a kot to take in.,"Written February 12, 2020"

As night falls every fifteen minutes, you experience a whole new world. An airport with all the moving parts including take offs and landings, a volcano, a concert, a harbor, trains, the wild West, Las Vegas... Even a miniature Venice. We could have spent another couple hours exploring, as it was we spent almost 4 just mesmerized by the shear scope of this miniature land. We visited first thing in the morning, and noticed the crowds getting more intense by afternoon... But totally manageable.

If you are now planning a trip to Europe, please include one more day and visit Miniatur Wunderland. It as a model railroad display in HO scale (small trains) where imagination will absolutely amaze you. Google it! Visit it! You will tell others about your experience. Allow at least four to six hours. Yes, there is so much to see and enjoy. PS When WE visit Europe again, Miniatur Wunderland will be a stop for us!",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Left a sour taste,"I'm drawn to writing this review after my experience at visiting this attraction. Arrival was very much as expected. You climb stairs to gain entry although there is a lift for disabled visitors. I had prebooked my ticket and this is generally advisable but on my visit was not really needed as the queues were very small. I put this down to being a week day, first thing in the morning so it's best I think to visit then. Also out of term time as well. The display was as been said very impressive, but the German section which I believe was the first area is showing some signs of wear now and needs a bit of loving care on it. There are lockers to place your rucksacks in but are not good for the very large ones, they cost a euro but that is returned when you retrieve your items.

Now the clincher for me I had pre booked the behind the scenes tour, I was told to go to the temporary control point which is where all the layout is controlled from. The appointed time came and no one turned up, on asking one of the operatives I found out I should of been at the old control point. By the time I got there I had missed the tour. I went to complain about the miss information I was given the only response I got you can have your money back. No effort was made to find out if I could of joined the tour or any real apology for the error, or if something could be done. A lesson in customer service here is needed. Yes there is a sign at the temp control station but this gives the impression your in the correct place. So this is a warning to others not to fall not this trap like I did.

As a result this did put a dampener on my visit hence 3 stars.","Written February 6, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Absolutely Mind Blowing!,"Amazing place! Incredible attention to detail and an insane amount of electronic and computer wizardry has gone into this! Way to much to take in. I would definitely do this again, and take an entire day to look around. We had the guided tour where we got to learn the 'secrets' of how it all works, and see stuff the general public don't get to see. Well worth doing. I can HIGHLY RECOMMEND this attraction to anyone with any respect of creativity and workmanship...and it's just good fun. Staff all friendly, everything clean. One thing that may be good is the occasional 'over 18s' evening where we don't have to suffer a million hyped-up children!Thanks for a great experience!",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Must visit place at Hamburg!,"Whenever I was visiting Hamburg I woshed to come there. The place are very busy, but it do not disturb pleasant views and so on. I was surprised how many figures, cars, planes, ships and action buttons are there. The place are very suitable for kids as well. I wish I will take my kid there when I will come back there. I have really enjoyed Germany, Switzerland and Italy there over the 15 minutes day light and night. Great work!",

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Fascinating...a must-see attraction...and a great value!,"We recently spent a few weeks traveling throughout Germany and specifically visited Hamburg to tour this attraction. The Minatur Wunderland was one of the highlights of our trip and I highly recommend for everyone...great for children to seniors! The numerous exhibits are individually fascinating and, in total, cover 2 entire floors of an old warehouse. The staff's attention to detail within each different exhibit is absolutely amazing and they do a great job of capturing every-day life in their working models. I loved the staff's sense of humor...from Pinocchio's growing nose to some sexually explicit scenes hidden in some exhibits (You'll have to look close to find them!) Everything is on full display including watching the artists work on improving existing exhibits and/or new & upcoming projects at several different work stations. There is a sliding pricing schedule for admission...from children to seniors, a restaurant and souvenir shop on site so you can spend as much time as you wish. The Minatur Wunderland is the BEST miniature exhibit that I've ever seen and would jump at an opportunity to visit again to see what's new!","Written January 16, 2020"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Great for all ages,"For the price, it was great value. The level of detail in all the figures was incredible. I thought the Hamburg working airport exhibit was fascinating.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Spellbinding!,"I didn't want to waste the day adjusting to the time change so I made a point to get out and explore.

Staying in the St Pauli/Reeperbahn part of town, I looked up how to get to the Miniatur Wunderland, after hearing raves from other friends who have already come to Hamburg.

I am not a sophisticated traveler.

I wing it and don't make lists of what to see.

This was a way for me to take a bus and wander to the area. I could have walked but already paid for a 4 day Hamburg pass.

The Miniatur Wunderland is in a quieter marine area and it's housed in a large old warehouse.

There is an elevator and it is on a couple of floors.

The overhead lights change periodically and it highlights the many working lights of displays and vehicles.

Mostly it is just wowing over the little marvels of miniature versions of places and areas all over the globe.

Even a mini airport with a display screen of arrivals and departures!

I loved the tiny drive-in with mini movies.
There is a multi-level Swiss mountain with different vantage points and a working movement ski lift.

There's trains, planes, cars, trucks and boats moving. Around mountains, cars do a right of way wait.

They even track where people visit from. And have a LED counting tally.

The volcano has steam/smoke emitting from it and the lights mimicking lava looks great.

Plan to give yourself time of about 1.5-2 hours or more if you like.

It is of course, family-friendly, and wheelchairs can manage.

Even trains have a see-through track on the floor.

And the repair and planning/construction areas are visible, but not accessible to the public.

Which means you can come and it doesn't mean it's the same old thing every visit.

They are proud of their work and they even have an old TripAdvisor award up on the wall.

I would keep the inner child amazed, and would do this again in a heartbeat!",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,AMAZING! Best tourist attraction ever,"I expected to have an hour here, but spent over 3 hours walking and going wow. Its incredible.
Forget that the entrance isn't that great - that's only because its in a tidal flood area. Once you go in, lose yourself and get down low and close to maximise the experience. Have a look for the naughty bits - that makes it good fun!","Written January 13, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Miniature Amazement!,"I‚Äôd heard so much about this place being a big fan of model railways but never did I think it would live up to all the hype. From the moment you walk in your jaw drops and it doesn‚Äôt lift up for a good few hours after you‚Äôve left. I‚Äôm still thinking about how wonderful it was days after visiting.

The level of detail is incredible. The size of it is incredible. The animations are incredible. The whole thing is just incredible. I‚Äôd advise going early or late so it‚Äôs not too busy otherwise you may struggle to see as much as you‚Äôd want. If you‚Äôre a fan of these types of things they do a behind the scenes tour. If I ever visit Hamburg again I‚Äôm definitely going on this tour.

The airport scene with aeroplanes taking off is just breathtaking. The larger planes take longer to get off the runway compared to the smaller ones and the detail of the planes touching down is just remarkable.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,World class attraction,We were so impressed. We knew it would be good but it exceeded our expectations. The exhibits are jaw-dropping. We sent 3 hours there.,"Written January 12, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Actually incredible,"A group of us went to this without any real expectations, just looking to do something touristy for the afternoon- we ended up staying there for about 4 hours in absolute awe. The attention to detail is incredible; the scenes are full of really funny and thoughtful details; you could really spend a whole day looking at them. Lots of interactive bits as well; honestly would really recommend for adults or children.","Written January 12, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Speechless,"It was my 2nd visit to Miniatur Wonderland with my son and we were just as excited as the first time. We spent 6 hours there and had to leave only because we had another engagement. Entrance fee was 15 euros for the 2 of us and its definitely worth the money. Knuffingen airport was our favourite section and we kept coming back to it again and again. We were hoping that Monaco might have been completed but it wasn't, so now we have another reason to visit this awesome place again.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Brilliant way to spend a few hours ( even if you not a railway fan),"This is a brilliant exhibition to visit. Several floors filled with model railways from around the world, it includes a fully operational airport, working boats and hundreds of models of famous buidings from around the world. Besides the model trains it features fully working roadways. The cameo scenes are outstanding and include a working volcano !!
There is an excellent restaurant available.
A couple of tips to note,
Try and pre book your tickets and get there early as it can get very busy and you could have to wait for a time slot to enter.
All details are on their website.
Make sure you know how to get there as it is not signposted greatly !!
Well worth visiting, my wife who is not a particular lover of model railways really enjoyed the experience, so much so that we spent about 6 hours going around.","Written January 16, 2020"

The attention to detail is extraordinary and there are lots of buttons to press that then makes part of the model move. Fascinating to watch the traffic lights and railway crossings, even the lorries have brake lights and indicators! I probably found the airport the most fascinating with planes landing, taking off and taxi-ing to and from gates. Venice was delightful with rocking gondolas and great attention to detail. We spent three hours there and could have spent at least another hour or two so give yourself plenty of time.","Written January 10, 2020"

Easy access to all, prams have to be left in a secure waiting area, but wheel chair accessible to all floors and exhibits. Exhibits are breath taking so a camera is a must. Nice cafe area with reasonable menu. Gift shop with a wide variety of tourist membrbelia from cheap and tacky to decent items. Book this in advance as the queues can be over an hour. Easy to get to by train (a 15 min walk or by No 6 bus). Wear comfy shoes. Leave big bags and coats at the desk for 50cents per item and enjoy yourself.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,"Excellent model world exhibition, allow plenty of time to see it all.","This is so much more than a model train exhibition - there are some fantastic scale towns and villages that have to be seen to be believed.The Airport is extraordinary, with planes that actually go down the runway and take off. We arrived around 10 AM and had to wait in the restaurant area for 50 minutes, so it's worth checking if you can buy a ticket in advance and secure an entry time. You need to allow several hours to see it all, we spent 3 1/2 hours there and had to rush through the last few exhibits, so next time we will start at the other end. There are several new exhibits to be launched later this year. We thought it was brilliant and if we return to Hamburg will certainly visit again.","Written January 8, 2020"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Late night visit to miss the crowds,"This is not a model railway display, this is a piece of art. Honestly, the whole thing is so well engineered that it being called a 'Model Railway' is just ludicrous. You are taken from place to place, country to country, scene to scene in beautifully crafted vignettes that just happened to have railways, roads, rivers and even aeroplanes in them. The sculpted scenery is stunning and the animations are very cleverly done. Lighting alternates from day to night and changes the whole perspective as it cycles through.
Yes, it can and does get full of visitors, is that a surprise? But plan ahead, buy a ticket before arriving and go straight in.
Sadly, it is not wheelchair friendly and to be fair, I cannot see how any display of this nature can be so as viewing is best done from somewhere higher than a sitting position.
So, if you like seeing well crafted miniaturised recreations, then this is a must. If you are somebody who would rather have a tooth drilled without anaesthetic than go to a model railway, (as I see some reviewers have put) then stay away and spend time elsewhere. If you do visit, allow at least four hours.","Written January 7, 2020"

We were in awe of the workmanship which has gone into this wonderland. The airport is particularly impressive. Not as extensive as we‚Äôd expected but worth a good couple of hours. We found the competition included with the map encouraged us to look a lot closer at things. Get there early though on weekends, we had 9am tickets and by 10.30 it was rammed.

Miniatur Wonderland is a really nice exhibition of different worlds with trains around it. The craftsmanship of the worlds is amazing and one could spend a lot of time admiring all that. Unfortunately we picked the wrong time and the exhibit was very crowded, including with people who wanted to video every single detail.
This took away a lot of the charm: it would have been a lot nice to experience the day and night sceneries without all these mobile phones in front of your face.

When I arrived, I saw many parents with their children waiting for the hourly admissions. Inside, the parents were more engaged and thrilled than their children, probably because of the massive European attractions/places were built using hundreds of thousands of pieces to depict places, i.e. the Vatican, Fountain of Trevi, Swiss Alps, German towns, etc. with moving trains, buses, cars, people. The airports with the planes lining up and taking off were probably my favorites. Seeing is believing in this museum...a true Wonder!","Written December 31, 2019"

There are a series of displays set over two floors. It was very busy when we visited and this can detract from the enjoyment. The lights periodically dim so you can see the scenes at night.

It was amazing and my wife and I agreed that we could easily have spent several hours if not days here to fully explore all there is to see. The scale and detail are beyond anything I have seen in a UK model village and every scene is full of humour. Planes take off, land and taxi. Vehicles drive without slots to guide them and indicate to change direction. Scenes from around the world and Germany are painstakingly recreated. All are animated and have special sections which can be activated at the push of a button. We squeezed it into 2 hours but would have liked to have spent longer. Thoroughly recommended to anyone of any age. We booked online and had no problems with queuing.

I stood transfixed staring at the airport for an hour not moving. I was gobsmacked. Lunch was nice in the bistro, nice touch with the train seats by the way. I would go again tomorrow and still find something new to marvel at, a top top attraction well worth my trip.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Mesmerising - a great day out for all ages.,"This is our second visit. The sheer scale of this place is mind blowing and the attention to detail is incredible. One trip is never enough. The scenes which are depicted also have a subtle sense of humour for the adults to enjoy! Everyone adores the airport - what‚Äôs not to like about watching the Death Star take off!?
Love the way the lights dim every so often to replicate night which adds another dimension to the experience. There is so much to see and it takes about 4 hours to see everything but that was with a short break for food in the middle .
I‚Äôm travelling with a young child with learning difficulties and have no issues here, he is absolutely mesmerised with things to see above him and below his feet.
There are plenty of clean accessible toilets, a cloak room and lockers, a great well stocked restaurant - reasonably priced with loads of choice and plenty of seats and even equipment & space for nursing mothers. A Huge shop with lots for little children to buy, so not all expensive stuff.

The models are impressive and the attention to detail in somewhat amazing. They have cars, Busses, trucks and fire stations that drive around and stop. Trains and boats driving around by themselves.. staggering.

Then you get to the model airport.. to my utter belief the planes take off and land all by themselves... they even take off at different angles to the what a plane of that size would do.

You can easily spend all day here.. just try to avoid when kids go!! I would also prebook a time slot .. or when you get there pick a slot and go wander rather than waiting.

Halfway round they really need to put a little coffee shop in .. I got hungry and needed coffee and had to wait !!

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Don't rush your visit.,"Having seen this on UK tv or somewhere I was intrigued. Could it really be that big or good? Having left the Hamburg DBH I immediately went the wrong way so got a cab, about $10 (euro) Dec 2019, to the door. It was actually very easy to find if I'd left the station the right way.

I had a pre booked ticket and went straight through to the bag/coat drop. For 1 euro leave the baggage in a safe place. Toilets and a cafe are inside as is a shop for all of your mementos of your visit.

Up the stairs, or lift, and you're met with the workshops and small displays, which gives an idea of what's to come, a concert in a sports stadium. Hundreds of people sat in the stadium with a concert on a stage, as would happen anywhere in the world.

In the main displays there are various city, rail displays and an airport. Each display shows a different city around the world. For me the Swiss mountain display beats everything hands down, although the rest are also nothing to be sniffed at. The work and detail put into the displays are exceptional.

During your visit you'll find the lights dimmed for the night views of the displays and yet again these are amazing with house lights coming on then off.

You're not limited to only stay in your 'timed slot' and are welcome to stay till closing. It's worth going around again as I'm sure you'll see something that you missed first time around.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Absolutely Beguiling!,"Expected a German version of Mardurodam. Got a totally unique experience. A little uneasy, since you must pass through a huge gift shop to enter the exhibition, but once inside it was fascinating. The exhibits right inside the entrance, showing a village at different stages in history, were terrific. I read a lot of history, and the short synopsis that accompanied each era was the most thorough and thought provoking I‚Äôve run across, and each point was illustrated by a scene in miniature to be found in the village. VERY well done. Once inside the main exhibition, everyone became a kid. How could you not? Just a remarkable morning, not at all the tourist trap I initially feared. I have three recommendations for your visit: 1.) allow adequate time. We only allotted two hours and I could easily have spent a couple more 2.) spend the time reading the video presentation at the beginning where the eras of the village are 3.) consider going later in the day to avoid the hoards of (mostly well behaved and overjoyed) preschoolers and perhaps 4.) consider taking reading glasses.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,A must-see,"This one is a must-see when you visit Hamburg. All these miniature things are all handmade, and you'll need hours to watch all the details.

The Millenium Falcon from Star Wars on the airport is one of them, but there are many, many smaller ones.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,It really is as good as the reviews!,"I read the reviews but still didn't believe them. I was travelling on my own and didn't think this would be so special, but it was mid-afternoon, raining and very cold so I decided to take a look. I had obviously not pre-booked, and although there was no queue to buy tickets I had to wait 20 minutes in the holding area (but was glad of the warmth and a sit down - there's a cafe there too). Within minutes of entering exhibition itself, I reckoned the entry price was more than worth it. I know that in 2 hours I probably missed loads of the detail, but this was a truly amazing experience. I have been to model exhibitions before and been underwhelmed, but this one was not only fabulously detailed and varied, but went on and on. The night and day experiences really add to the magic and mean that you need to see each part of the display for a decent length of time. I particularly liked the moving road traffic and the airport, in addition to the trains. A particular hit also was the music festival site. I have managed to fool several people with my photographs.",

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,The detail was mind-blowing!,"We booked online roughly 1 month before we visited, for 9.30 - 10.30 (the next slot was fully booked). Although we arrived 15 mins early we were admitted instantly. Although there is a cloakroom where you can leave coats etc (‚Ç¨0.50/ item), you can use lockers which have a returnable deposit of ‚Ç¨1 - better value! We were very fortunate that we visited on a Monday - the weekend was fully booked online. We loved it from start to finish. While it got busier as the day went on, we never had to wait too long to get a front line view. The detail for each area is amazing, with interactive options available to give additional movement, eg lighting, lifts, cranes etc. We were there for nearly 5 hours (including meal breaks) and could have stayed longer. We seem to have been lucky with the lack of crowds, even though this was the Christmas market period, albeit in term time.","Written December 10, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Alice in Wonderland meets German technology and craftsmanship,This place is a marvel! If I had been in Hamburg more than a couple of days I would have visited again.

If you take a closer look.....the thousands of hand painted miniature people have personalities....it's surreal.,"Written December 9, 2019"

Recommend booking in advance, allows you to skip the queue (line to our US readers). I am a railway fan but it's about more than that. It's about modelling people, and places and reflecting a version of our world back to us.We also took the backstage tour for for EUR15 extra.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,EXCELLENT FOR THOSE WITH IMAGINATION,"The up's and downs....

I first visited this just after it was opened over 16 years ago with my girlfriend and we always said we would return, which we did with a colleague Dec 2019 to see how it's grown.

For us - it was a fantastic experience and well worth the visit - again looking at the new country locations added, the technology that's gone into the building of it and the sheer scale of it all. The programming of the planes landing, taxiing to their bays and taking off, the cars which follow the various roads with lights and indicators, the various emergencies that are reacted to and so on. The actual models and scenes are brilliant and one can spend alot of time just looking in one area, spotting the little cameos and amusing set-ups which are invariably there. Some are very representative of actual places whilst other scenes are loosely based on a typical location but, a small amount of imagination is all that's needed. The nighttime changeover is fabulous with hundreds of thousands of lights on the cars, buildings and various elements.

However, I did read with sadness and incredulity some of the crass comments made by some in this review and can only say judging by a few, they are written by those with no imagination or whose sole ability for enjoyment is getting drunk in a bar.

Yes - it is popular so there is the chance it could be crowded consequently, it is definitely worth pre-booking tickets for a time-slot entry. Unfortunately, there will be lots of children especially school trips (best to avoid weekends if possible) and children do get hyper...!!!

I will warn those who are in a wheelchair that sadly, this is not the exhibition to visit on a general day although the centre has now organised 'wheelchair only' days to overcome this, so suggest you enquire. For the infirm and those with standing issues, this could also be difficult - sadly it's the nature of the exhibition and difficult to address.

However, if you enjoy models, have a good imagination and wish to see what can be achieved by the hard work and imagination of others... this is the place to come. My grandson is now 1 year old. In another 10 years or so, i'll be revisiting with him to see what new countries and technologies have been added.

I hope you have the same enjoyable experience we did if you go.","Written December 6, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Breathtaking miniature wonder that is hard to explain... a must do while in Hamburg!,No words to describe this place! It is quite an adventure that allows you to immerse yourself into a wonderful miniature world. Breathtaking illustration of many wonderful places that define our world. You truly feel as if you were traveling all these places. Meticulous attention to detail to portray the traits of every place in the world that they so carefully have put together. Kudos to the people who put this wonder together. Suitable for all ages. Everyone will be impressed. Just showing a few pictures from the portrayal of Italy in order to avoid spoilers.

We went through several times and I know I still didn‚Äôt see it all! The details are beyond mind blowing. The USA was represented by the Southwest (an accurate mileage sign on I-15) & a few other places. Many other places I‚Äôve visited I recognized immediately. The lights dim with dusk, all the nightlights come on. Excellent experience for all ages.

Had to wait an hour to get in but you can wait in the restaurant where snacks and drinks are available and they provide free soft drinks. Definitely worth the wait. Spent ages in the the exhibit. The detail of the miniature displays is just superb. Brilliant as the lights go down and the exhibit is in dark every so often so you see the displays all lit up. Can't recommend enough.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Very interesting!,"I was really surprised with it. Not that I was expecting it to be bad, just not so rich!

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,The 1st attraction in Germany. Plus a little more to boot.,"Neuschwanstein castle adorns the covers of all travel guides in Germany, which makes up the belief that it is number 1 in the top of the main sites in Germany. However, sociology is a stubborn thing. The German national Committee for tourism (DZT) after a survey of 40 thousand tourists from around the world put the romantic brainchild of Ludwig II only in third place. And on the first - Miniatur Wunderland in Hamburg. Freud was right, regression into childhood is ubiquitous. It is naive to think that most visitors here are children. No it's adults. Maybe Eric Byrne was right with his transactional analysis, arguing that the child sits in all of us along with the adult and the parent. Or maybe we want to be a couple of hours Swift`s hero Gulliver, surveying the world around us. We want to turn on the contrary, making us big, and the world is small. On a scale of 1: 87. It costs 15 euros for adults and 7.5 for children under 15. Children up to 1 meter are free. You'll have to spend time waiting in line. You can reduce the last coming early in the morning at 9 or in the evening and on weekdays. The money spent is worth it. Of course, this is almost the price of the Louvre ( 17 EU) at a disparate scale of exposure. But on the other hand we will see the Harz mountains, the Swiss Alps, Knuffingen airport, the beauty of gingerbread Austria, Las Vegas and Scandinavia. And you don't have to go to Neuschwanstein, it's waiting for you here. Under the roof, not under the Alpine winds. Piazza San Pietro can be seen from above, as can Venice. Half of Europe in one hand.",

Lockers are provided for a returnable 1 euro deposit, its good to leave all your coats and bags there. Take your time slowly going round the exhibition as there is so much to see. We also opted for the behind the scene tour which is tour a real model fan I highly recommend you do. Lunch is a must and the food is excellent, as is the restaurant itself. There are lockers should you run out of battery for your phone, take your power bank to avoid any disappointment. This is one of best days we have had in a long time.

I strongly recommend to visit it!",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Endless things to discover,"The Miniatur Wunderland is huge and every place they built is incredibly detailled. You can spend a lot of time observing each of them and discover small things and hidden surprises. You realize how much this is a work of passionate dedication to miniature building. I especially enjoyed how the whole building's lighting follows a day-night rhythm and once it grows dark you can see small street lanterns, windows and model train lights turn on - and sometimes a volcano or a fire breaks out or an alien spaceship lands. We entered the exhibition at 10:00 and left at 16:00, so it's very much an all-day activity.","Written November 17, 2019"

Whilst at first glance it is quite impressive on closer inspection it's really dusty and in a poor state of repair and much of it is just shop-bought toy vehicles (with not much regard paid to things being to a consistent scale). I'm sure kids would enjoy it but for us it felt like a waste of time and money.,"Written November 3, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,I love it and can stay at the Knuffingen Airport for hours,"I just love the Miniatur Wunderland and my godson and his brother also had a great time. Honestly I really don't know how these creators work, but the two floors of miniature cities reflect amazing handicraft and technical work. The room will keep on rotation between day and night time so you can see the lights. Just pay attention to everything because they even have small human figures inside of the ships, buildings and whatever. Knuffingen is an imagined city and the airport is just a highlight because they have planes that actually took off and landing, and they were just like real airports, where the planes parked at gates, pushed back from gates, taxied, took off and landed.

I agree that you should buy tickets online in advance. You will need to plan a bit but it will be helpful especially during holidays and weekends. However, the place can be crowded. I came during school holidays so there were crowds especially in the Germany section. Maybe you should start from the last city and worked backward, so you would go against the crowd.",

We stayed in the museum for almost 4 hrs without any complain or getting bored. They enjoy it so much that we went again. Ofcourse expect them to be tired afterwards... which is good :)

It‚Äôs a unique experience for the whole family. You have the chance to see the making process of the miniatures and demonstrate to your kids physical phenomena or transportation means and historical events.

I recommend everyone to visit. Wear comfy shoes and take water as you will be standing quite long time.

Lastly, expect to see at least a few rude people pushing you to take a ... picture. They are usually HuGe & Tall north European Mountains that will block the view of many people... just ignore their uncivilized manners... and enjoy!!!!

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,The Biggest and Some of the Best,"If you like model railroads or just miniature modeling, this attraction is tailor made for you and/or your family. It is the largest model railroad in the world, modeling highlights from countries around the world, including Germany, Italy, the U.S., Switzerland, etc., many villages, harbors, huge train stations, ships and so much more. They‚Äôre all interconnected and span two floors with hundreds of trains, thousands of cars (many of which move), tens of thousands of figures and an enormous airport at which planes take off and land. Some of the modeling is astounding, recreating many iconic landmarks from various countries. And it‚Äôs even expanding. Definitely worth a visit at which you can spend an entire day.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Extremely crowded!!,"Amazing exhibitions that were hard to enjoy because of the crowd and other people. We made the mistake of coming in the afternoon on a Sunday. It was SO BUSY. You could barely move! Adults were rude, pushing, shoving to get pictures, letting little kids touch exhibits, etc.

Would maybe return but definitely not on the weekend and definitely not in the afternoon.","Written October 14, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Awesome model railroad for all ages,"WOW. Much cooler than I expected. I spent about 3 hours covering it quickly. Could easily spend days here to take it all in. Lots of mini tableaux in even the smaller scenes. And, when I say model railroad, it is one like no other‚Äîliterally miles of track, vehicles, and a working airport with air and ground traffic. Well worth a trip-I recommend buying the timed ticket in advance and catch the behind the scenes tour if available.","Written October 13, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Loved it but be careful,"Was the one thing we wanted to see when visited Hamburg since we originally had only a few hours as were on our way to Kiel to join up with a cruise ship. Got there very early. Had a coffee and pastry in the cafe, nothing nearby was open yet. Loved the different areas, the detail is amazing. Took tons of pictures. Got crowded very quickly with people pushing in to see all the exhibits. AS we were leaving the husband checked his pocket and we realized his wallet was pickpocketed with passport, driver's license, credit cards and cash. We then spent an extra day in Hamburg and couple nights in Frankfurt obtaining a new passport and finally joining up with the cruise. BE CAREFUL.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Small but large!,"We liked this a lot more than we expected!
Very cool ""museum"", the hours of work put into this is amazing. Be prepared for a massive crowd of people, though! At the end we were a little overwhelmed and ended up hurrying though the last floor to finish.

The sets are amazing with the longest and largest train set in the world. I loved the buildings, stadiums and the humour in each set. Look out for the volcano, Star Wars and Ghostbusters surprises!
I loved the fact the rooms are on a 12 minute cycle from dawn to dusk.
It‚Äôs rightly so popular that they are expanding into new buildings.
I look forward to seeing Paris, London and New York plus the 7 wonders of the ancient and modern worlds! A unbelievably brilliant Hamburg highlight and I‚Äôm not a model train enthusiast. I can see why so many adore it!","Written October 10, 2019"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Mixed feelings.,"We visited Hamburg from the UK for the sole purpose of visiting wonderland. The models and layouts were simply amazing. Loads to see as there are lots of intricacies‚Äô that if you don‚Äôt look close enough you could miss. Our issues lay with the staff and rudeness of many of the visitors (not much you can do about that i know) shoving and pushing and tolerance of my son ( ASD&SLD) was negligible. Food was great but pricey however the majority of the staff were rude, lacked good manners and apart from a couple looked like they were being forced to work there. A gentleman brought a piece of fish back that was frozen and the girl snatched it back off him with out uttering a word and flung it in the fryer again. This didn‚Äôt spoil our visit however we did find the intolerance of people with disabilities was the main observation on our trip. Definitely will not be returning to this place. This is no discredit to the hard work of the people responsible for the displays, just not a place we‚Äôre we felt comfortable. We were upset about the way people reacted to our son. Such an shame.","Written October 9, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazing Experience,"I had seen a you-tube video of Miniatur Wonderland several years ago, and decided that we had to see it someday. Thankfully, we recently had the opportunity and were not disappointed. The attention to detail, and the worldly scope of their exhibits made it a fascinating experience. Many large cities are instantly recognizable, and the planes taking off, cars and trucks dodging each other, not to mention railroads circling mountains, were exceptionally realistic. They've created an amazing experience overall, enhanced when they turn out the overhead lights, and the towns come alive with their street lights, headlights, stop lights, etc., especially in their Las Vegas exhibit. Highly recommend this museum to satisfy the child in all of us.","Written October 8, 2019"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Fun Couple of Hours Enjoying Fantastic Attention to Detail,"We visited here on our Honeymoon earlier this year and had a fantastic time. We didn't book in advance and arrived mid-morning on a Friday. A welcoming receptionist greeted us in excellent English and explained there would be a wait prior to entering the main area as they staggered the starts to ensure a good flow of people. We had to wait around 30 minutes in a well lit and equipped waiting room before being able to go up to the main event.
The main attractions are fantastic, large in scale and incredibly detailed, taking hours to create. The lights, trains, vehicles and interactive parts are incredibly well crafted and can surprise as much as they can fascinate. Much of the fun comes from simply observing the sets, using your eagle eye to spot some of the (in)famous scenes and others which arent well known, but bring a smile to your face.
I wouldnt say there was a particular highlight, as each section was fantastic in it's own right, but needless to say we took more photos here than at any other point during our visit to Hamburg.
Well worth a visit and a great way to spend a few hours.","Written October 7, 2019"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Fantastic!,"During the day that our cruise ship was docked in the port of Kiel, we were involved in a guided tour to Hamburg. This tour took us to see various attractions located around the central city area of Hamburg.
Our first stop was at the Miniatur Wunderland model railway and model airport exhibition building. On the day of our visit, there was a long queue of visitors at the ticket desk waiting to purchase admission tickets. Fortunately, because we were on a tour, we were allowed to go straight in without having to wait.
We were just blown away by the size of the various displays and the amount of detail included in the various layouts. Despite there being many visitors present, it was relatively easy to move around to view the different displays.
One thing that visitors need to be wary of is that from time to time, the building‚Äôs main interior lighting is dimmed so that the special lighting effects on the layouts can be appreciated. When this occurs it can become quite dark. In a crowded environment, this could provide an opportunistic pickpocket with the chance to strike. Consequently, visitors need to take good care of their personal valuables.
At the end of our time at the Miniatur Wunderland, we visited their well-stocked gift and souvenir shop where we managed to make a couple of purchases.
Because, we were on a tour, we were only able to stay at the Miniatur Wunderland for about ninety minutes. We would have loved to have stayed much longer as it was fantastic.
It was the highlight of our day in Hamburg!",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazing,"You don‚Äôt have to be a model railway enthusiast to enjoy a visit to this brilliant attraction.
The sheer scale of the model railways and surrounding scenery is amazing.
There is even a massive airport with planes taking off and landing. All ages will appreciate a visit. It was very busy but with a bit of patience you can see everything.
Give yourself at least 3 or 4 hours to see and appreciate the detail of the model towns and villages. There are replicas of famous buildings in Hamburg and Rome . While you are looking at a section of wunderland you will see vehicles moving in different directions, observing traffic signals and trains running on various tracks.
The restaurant has good choice and reasonably priced.","Written October 3, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Highlight of my trip to Hamburg!,,"Written October 3, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Great things come in small models,"Situated inside a warehouse building at the UNESCO-listed Speicherstadt, this indoor gallery/exhibition is truly an outstanding work in progress. Tickets cost 15‚Ç¨ per adult (student discounts available), and is absolutely worth every cent, considering the level of detail and thought that has gone into every figurine and arrangement.

We went there without reservations on a late Monday morning, and although we had to wait for around 25 mins to enter, it didn‚Äôt feel long as the waiting area had a caf√© and several puzzle games to keep one busy. Inside, we were overwhelmed by the variety of model themes on display, from Italian landscapes to limestone caves. My personal favourite was the airport, where you get to see aeroplanes literally taking off and landing!

Additionally, you also get to have a sneak peek of the ongoing work that goes into creating and maintaining the displays, with craftsmen/-women at work for visitors to view. At the end, we spent nearly three hrs exploring, and could easily have stayed longer if time permitted. If you get hungry in between, there is another cafeteria inside selling full hot meals.

Overall, it was a really enjoyable visit, and it really doesn‚Äôt matter how old you are or whether you‚Äôre into miniature models ... the place has certainly got something for everyone! In any case, it's a great indoor activity for a cold, rainy day.","Written October 2, 2019"

At the end of the day this is and should be among the top spots to visit when you‚Äôre in Hamburg.

The detail, scale and overall professional way the exhibits are presented is really incredible. We have visited in real life many of the areas recreated in miniature and it is amazing to see how real they look.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Absolutely outstanding,"I had heard that it was worth a visit , but nothing prepared me for just how exceptional this attraction is.
Very easy to find in the Hafencity area of Hamburg , I was surprised to find there was a 2 hour wait for entry. I asked how long we would need to go round , 2 hours came the reply.
We duly returned having purchased 2 tickets at ‚Ç¨15 each .
7 hours later we left at closing time (8pm)
There are 9 very large zones split over 2 floors , any 1 of which would be worthy of a 2 hr visit for ‚Ç¨15.
The sheer scale is mind blowing.
The level of detail is outstanding , with literally thousands of fantastic scenes. The level of imagination is unbounded. You could visit 100 times and not spot all the details.
The buildings are truly fantastic, with everything from churches , football stadia, ports, stations , temples, hotels and so so so much more
I would have been happy to have paid that for just 1 of the 9 areas.

It must be the trains, planes, ships, football matches, concerts and even dolphins. Try looking for the couple trying to be discreet. Then there's the Vatican, Swiss Alps the Americas and a erupting volcano.

The models themselves are incredibly well made, but it's the little humourous details that make it worth while. Atlantis, Greta Thunberg on an icefloe, a dragon flying in the background etc. Even the recursion of having a model of the miniatur wonderland itself, miniature railroad visible through the miniature windows.",

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Such an amazing experience,"We had pre-booked our tickets online which meant that we didn‚Äôt have to queue. So it was straight up the stairs and into the exhibition.

The good reviews on here are not wrong as the museum recreated miniature versions of railroads, cities and life in Germany, Europe and even America. It even includes a fully operational version of Hamburg airport. It was quite mesmerising watching the flights take off.

There is so much tiny detail in the exhibitions such as fire engines moving through the streets to respond to fires and car accidents. We even spotted a model of a dead man in a stream!

To say the wife was in her element is an understatement. She waited for ten minutes for the displays to go dark so she could press the UFO button. This triggered a UFO to fly over a display of Middle Germany.","Written September 19, 2019"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Made you feel like a kid again!,"Went with my wife, who only really went to keep me happy. In the end I think she enjoyed it as much as I did. It is a tremendous attraction with so much to see and it makes you look for the small attention to detail that reveals funny or unusual scenes within the main dioramas. It took us 3.5 hrs to get round and you are surrounded by people who are enjoying things as much as you are, so it makes for a great atmosphere.

The kids love it but sometimes quite difficult to appreciate it with so many people vying to get a photo of the incredible displays.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Definitely worth a visit if you are in Hamburg,"Very easy to get to via the U-Bahn (U3 to Baumwal). If you like model railways then this is a must-see.

I also scheduled a behind-the-scenes tour for the next day. They keep the tour sizes small (up to 6 people), so you get a very personalized experience.

The models are setup in different geographic regions, America, Scandinavia, Hamburg/Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.

Other than trains there are road vehicles (buses, trucks/etc) that drive around the roads, there are planes, and boats. There are many buttons that guests can press to activate different scenes (loggers chopping trees, lights & music at a night club, a ski-lift, emergency vehicles, etc).

There are lockers & a coat check area for items, as a well as a cafeteria with nice German foods.",

Germany,Stadel Museum,The Making of Van Gogh exhibit,"You truly cannot go wrong in seeing this exhibit. It is tastefully presented with enough art and historic information to make it an overall enjoyable experience. Definitely worth the extra money to skip the line. Except for three things. First, there was no crowd control noticeable regarding the number of people allowed in, which was overwhelming. At times there were people eight deep trying to see one painting that made if almost virtually impossible to read the details about the work. If you tried waiting for some people to move for a better look, another wave of people came in. Second, due to this sea of people, it was uncomfortably warm. Third, also due to the amount of people, you had to go to the restroom before you needed to, because there were not enough facilities. At the time I went the line for the ladies room was over 30 people long.","Written February 10, 2020"

Germany,Stadel Museum,Experience the importance of Van Gogh,"A great way to see the importance of Van Gogh. The exhibit perfectly lays out how Van Gogh was the instrumental painter in the transition from Impressionism to the modern of the 20th century.

Next to his works you directly see Van Gogh‚Äôs influence on the development of German and European painting from the 1910s on.

One moves with great freedom in the exhibition and can see up close the work on the painting. Be sure to order tickets online and book a time slot to avoid standing in line for hours.

Germany,Stadel Museum,"Excellent Museum with some historic Art, great curation.","The museum was founded in 1817 and has Art from the 14th century to Modern Art. There was a Tizian exhibition in May when we visited that was enjoyable and educational, it was well curated. The museum has a really excellent permanent collection. One of the most significant paintings for me was the Monet painting called 'The Luncheon' which was the painting that the jury of the Paris Salon on 1870 turned down. So Monet instead turned to Impressionism. 'The Luncheon' is a nice painting but it was the turning point to Impressionism. There are many other works of Art that are worth seeing and spending a day or at least an afternoon there is well worth it. Some good paintings of historic Frankfurt can be viewed too.",
Germany,Stadel Museum,Subpar,"After reading all of the reviews here, I was amazed at how poor the collection was.

It was not busy at all the day we went, though -- so it's not necessarily the crowds I'm talking about -- it's the shear vastness of the place.

However, when we visited, The Geographer by Johannes Vermeer was on loan at an undetermined location, and The Blinding of Samson by Rembrandt was not being exhibited. There were no works by Rubens or Van Gogh, standards in most other major European art museums.

The entry charge is justified by the quality of the collection. We were failry exhausted after going around the old masters' galleries, though happily there is a cafe (as well as a more formal restuarant). The collection of medieval paintings -- primarily German and Low Countires, including Bosch, Christus, the Flemalle master -- was superb and we fell in love with an altarpiece from a nunnery which had a Virgin at the centre and painted wings, but space presumably for relics.

I've never seen a Modern Art collection that was setup within a context. Usually, you see isolated works of art, put in place coincidentally. Not so at the Stadel! The explaining texts connect the diverse subsections with each other, the architecture seems to be around the pictures, and not the other way round. Every work of art is given enough space to breathe, and the collection has been obviously driven by some purpose, some plan.

Germany,Stadel Museum,Love it,"All in all, I loved this place. It obviously doesn't have the collection of princes and emperors as at the main museums in Munich or Vienna, but it's nonetheless strong in both highlights and breadth. Even more so, they do a lot in terms of providing a rich experience for viewers. Took me from about noon until 6pm (6 hours!) to get through the whole collection thoroughly, with a few breaks for coffee or snacks, though the galleries always felt like a pleasure.

Maybe the best wall labels I've seen at any museum on the planet? I've got a graduate degree in art history and actually learned *a lot* from the labels here!

The collection itself is solid, reflects the long history of Frankfurt as drawing primarily on its merchant class to buy Northern Ren and German old masters, with some Italians sprinkled in, along with a good collection of Die Brucke and Blaue Reiter and some nice Courbets and Nazarenes, among others. The contemporary section leans too heavily on macho posturing of 70s and 80s Neo Expressionism, so expect a lot of empty Albert Oehlen type works that go on forever.

Germany,Stadel Museum,Impressive collection but it could be better organized,"The collection is indeed impressive, covering all periods of Western painting and representing a majority of the most renown artists from Italy, Spain, France, Netherlands, Belgium, etc. The collection of renaissance Flemish painters was quite comprehensive. Contemporary painting was very well represented too. This is probably the 'go-to' place to admire the creations of E.L. Kirchner and Max Beckmann.
The Downside is the way the display is set up, with no particular order or a chronological plan: One room is Italian renaissance and the next one is XIX century English painting to move back to medieval religious paintings in the following room. Kirchner paintings also were displayed awkwardly in different locations without an apparent logic to it.

Picasso‚Äôs lithographic exhibition is good, with many intriguing prints and some colourful lino cuts.

Titian and the Venetian Renaissance is also really good although quite crowded. Lots of work by Titian himself, plus Tintoretto, Bassano, Veronese and El Greco amongst others.

The permanent collection is huge. A great selection of Impressionist work and as you‚Äôd expect, a wide range of German art.

Germany,Stadel Museum,A favorite place to meet art eye-to-eye ...,"This museum is a must on your list if you are fond of art and visiting Frankfurt. I had the pleasure several times already, and usually I focus on the temporary exhibition. So far, I have found it to be excellently curated, with a helpful audio guide to take along on a maybe two-hour tour (if you do not rush) into the selected history of art on display.
I have seen the occasional longer line at the check-in due to the popularity of the exhibitions, and I have never really experienced the museum as being less than well visited, but maybe that varies with day and time. Checking in advance will not hurt!
The permanent exhibition is great as well, so if you are going to be here only once, make sure to take your time (and relax in the very nice caf√© afterwards :-)","Written April 20, 2019"

Germany,Stadel Museum,Mixed feelings,"I am not an art lover, but I like to try and enjoy it hence my visit.

I wouldn‚Äôt say the arrival experience is particularly positive - a little bit stand-offish, why not just be friendly and welcoming like other sectors of the service industry.

The major exhibition was Titian - and I managed to navigate it in reverse. The signage that takes you to it takes you to the 2nd part of the exhibition on the upper level. Anyway, there were clearly some notable pieces of art here, and it was interesting enough.

The highlight for me was the room dedicated to Max Beckmann - never heard of him - but his work was really thought provoking, sadly it was only about 15 items.

The lowlight, well I took off my coat for a few minutes as it was quite warm. I was quickly reprimanded - apparently holding your coat is not permitted, it‚Äôs either worn or in the cloakroom. It would have been a fairly spectacular heist for me to get out of there with a piece of art under my coat!

So, in a nutshell, some things to enjoy, some not so enjoyable.","Written February 22, 2019"

Germany,Stadel Museum,Special exhibition Vasarely,"We visited the museum in the last days of showing the temporary Vasarely exhibition, so it was a 15-minutes waiting to get in, but it was worth to see his works in their original size, and it was more exciting for a teenager than the old masters.
After this we went through the rooms of the modern painters¬¥s section as well.
Certainly you can¬¥t compare this museum¬¥s collections to the bigger ones, but I think there¬¥re many interesting objects which are not so well-known, and many by German painters too (which shouldn¬¥t be a surprise).

Actually when we went in about 1010 on a Saturday morning (December) we walked straight up to the desk and got in no problem!

The ticket‚Äôs not cheap but you get both temporary exhibitions included in the price and it‚Äôs a large collection. We didn‚Äôt bother with the audio guide (50% of the ticket price) and still spent around 2.5 hours going round, most pics have info in English next to them.

Loved the ‚Äòbacks of paintings‚Äô section, something really different!

One of the good galleries that lets you take photos :)

Apparently there‚Äôs a sculpture garden, we never saw any signs to it and missed it completely.

Some of the descriptions on the walls have missing lettering, made it feel a little unloved. Not sure what they‚Äôre waiting for to fix them...

The works were logically ordered with sections for Italian, German, Dutch & French etc., & the galleries moved through time, so to speak, from older works to far more contemporary areas. I also know that they hold major exhibitions here as, for example, they recently hosted one focussing on Raphael. I particularly enjoyed the feeling of space as this is a good-sized Museum which was extended below ground in 2012 to house the modern Art they hold . There are also interesting gardens around the Museum which are worth a look as they contain many sculptures & installations, plus the skylight dome which lights the new extension.",

The basement level also has a very interesting collection of post 1945 works. There are also representative works from many of the world greats including the Impressionists, Vermeer, Van Eyck, Rembrandt and Rubens.","Written June 5, 2018"

The special Reubens exhibition I saw was very good, and I expect like most second tier museums, the Staedel aims for a series of first tier exhibitions to supplement its heavily German offerings.

Most important, when in Frankfurt ‚Äî easily one of the dullest big cities on the planet ‚Äî this is just about the only game in town... outside of whatever business meetings you‚Äôre conducting, of course. Just don‚Äôt expect to be awestruck. This isn‚Äôt the Met, or the Louvre or the National Gallery of Art. It is what it is, where it is, and it could be worse.

Germany,Stadel Museum,This is a very good collection,"I spent almost a whole day in the 200 year old Stadel Museum enjoying the broad collection they have. I was pleased to find there were major works from many artists I have previously encountered, as well as works by artists who are new to me. The works were logically ordered with sections for Italian, German, Dutch & French etc., & the galleries moved through time, so to speak, from older works to far more contemporary areas. I also know that they hold major exhibitions here as, for example, they recently hosted one focussing on Raphael. I particularly enjoyed the feeling of space as this is a good-sized Museum which was extended below ground in 2012 to house the modern Art they hold . There are also interesting gardens around the Museum which are worth a look as they contain many sculptures & installations, plus the skylight dome which lights the new extension.",
Germany,Stadel Museum,Spending some time with Rubens & friends-Fabulous!,"Accidentally wandered into Frankfurt's Museum sector as a first time visitor to discover the Rubens exhibition from enormous enticing placards set out front. As lovers of Arts, history and #culturebuffs it wasn't that hard!

Drawn by the grandeur of the buildings facade and excited by what it held we eagerly signed up once inside for the Rubens exhibition being held. Included in the price were Audioguides for an extra fee but well worth the ‚Ç¨7 to hear the in-depth description of each of the works.

Some photography was permitted with signs clearly showing that as well as a detailed description of the works magnificently curated.

Covering many rooms the exhibition also included other masters and more lesser known works from artists from Renaissance and other highlighted periods in history.

There's plenty of seating inside the exhibition to take in the works or discuss in the cafe over a glass of wine and delicious snacks and meals. Time didn't permit this as we spent so much time in the exhibition!

Allow at least 3 hours but preferably a day to sample the full gamut at leisure or even more!

Germany,Stadel Museum,Go go go to Frankfurt' best museum!,"I visited four museums in Frankfurt, and this was by far the best one. You will see Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Rembrandt, and right now (April 2018) a special Rubens exhibit. There is a very unusual display of the backs of paintings. It explains how experts can tell how the painting was mounted, see various markings made by the artist, and learn more about the material on which the work was painted. This all helps provide provenance. Interesting and unexpected.

Allow 2 hours for a thorough visit. I paid for the audio guide, but then learned that there is an app you can download and listen on your phone. I wish the cashier had mentioned that.

One caveat: This was the noisiest art museum I have ever visited. There were some school groups which created much of the cacophony, as they can do. What I did not understand was that no one tried to address this and ask them to be respectful. Also, you will be asked to put your backback or other large bag in a locker (1 euro). If you carry a jacket, they insist you wear it or tie the arms around your waist.

There are three permanent exhibitions: Old Masters 1300-1800, Modern Art 1800-1945 and Contemporary Art 1945-. This spring the museum has also a Rubens exhibition. So there are many kinds of art on display.",
Germany,Stadel Museum,Rubens and not only!,"Don't miss the chance to visit this amazing museum during your stay in Frankfurt. Located on the South Bank of the river Main, not so far from Romerberg and its old square, the St√§del Museum is not only hosting this stunning comprehensive Rubens's exhibit, dramatically called ""The Power of Transformation"", but it also boasts a good number of worldwide renowned masterpieces of famous artists. Rubens's special exhibition features about 120 among the huge paintings and drawings of the Flemish talented artist, whose voluptuous women and pastoral or mythological settings, housed in this remarkable single show, will leave you open-mouthed!
The admission fee to the whole museum is not expensive, also given the uniqueness of the Rubens's event: only ‚Ç¨ 16,00 at weekends for each single adult, and with only 4 more euros, you'll be supplied with the audio-device, a very practical way to be guided not only through Rubens's exhibit, but also throughout the whole premises and their wonderful collections, which include impressive works of art by such talents as Vermeer, Botticelli, Mantegna, Verrocchio, Van Eyck and his amazing ""The Lucca Madonna"", Bosch, Guercino, Renoir, Munch. When you get out of the building, after spending such a meaningful and magical time, you'll find the walk along the river Main a really relaxing and enjoyable moment. Have a good stay!",

A lot of nice pieces showing the interrelation of northern and southern Renaissance art and the influence of both in Germany. The collection of Max Beckmann's work was a highlight for me, especially since some of it had Frankfurt as its subject. The contemporary art downstairs was worth visiting for the space alone.

Germany,Stadel Museum,Matisse - Bonnard Exhibition / 5-Stars!,"I had an opportunity to see this museum's outstanding permanent collection on my last visit to Frankfurt. On this visit, I came to see ""Matisse - Bonnard"" a major exhibition featuring a large number of works by French artists Henri Matisse and Pierre Bonnard. The exhibition was an opportunity to see works of two important artists, who not only shared a forty year friendship, but a like for the same subject matter, side-by-side. With the works arranged by categories that included landscapes, still lifes, interiors and nudes, it was a rare opportunity to see how two talented artists approached similar subject matter. The results were impressive.

This was my first time seeing so many Bonnard paintings together at one time, providing more appreciation for his talent. This well staged exhibition by the Staedel, was one of my favorite exhibitions of 2017. No photos were allowed in the exhibition.

As mentioned earlier, the Staedel has a fine permanent collection that's not to be missed. They also have a nice gift shop and restaurant. The Staedel is located along Frankfurt's famous museum row.",

Germany,Stadel Museum,Seriously impressive,"Having visited most of the major art museums in Germany, I would say the Stadel is the best of those that cover the whole history of art (slightly ahead of the Hamburg Kunsthalle). The Matisse/Bonnard exhibition was brilliantly curated with the most enthralling audio guide. I went in not being a big fan of Matisse and came out appreciating him a little better. But Bonnard was the real eye-opener with his dazzling colours and mysterious ghostly presences. The permanent collection is superb. A particularly fine collection of Kirchner and Beckmann paintings but most of the big names are represented with major works, aside curiously from the pioneers of abstract art. The museum is generous with loans so some of its iconic works were not on show but enough were. The audioguide for the permanent collection was fantastic with an unusually large number of works covered unlike in some more august institutions. There was a 30min entry queue which was probably due to Matisse. If there is a big exhibition it is worth buying online and waltzing straight in. The cafe in the bookshop also had a long queue. There is also a pricey restaurant, which was pretty empty. I think the museum could reorganise to give the cafe more space and reduce the queue. Overall, simply superb.","Written January 8, 2018"

The exterior is made from Sandstone that is blackened from the weather and it took 632 years from the start of construction to when it was eventually finished, with wars and bombings in between. Easily seen from the Rhine River it is a UNESCO World Heritage Sight. When we were there there was a lot of scaffolding around the building as they were cleaning the sandstone, a massive job. It is situated close to the railway station, beware of scams and pick pockets in the area. Our guide told us that people are distracted by the chalk art work on the ground and then get their wallets stolen. The interior is amazing, if you're fit enough then going to the top platform via the 533 steps is worth it. It was a slow walk up as there were so many people doing it, but the views were great.",

The outside, which is made of sandstone, has a gothic, grayish hue. However, when the sun hits it, the slight display of a pinkish/tan can be observed. Inside, the stained glass and floor are just breathtaking. Be sure to take your time and look at the intricacies of the floor. We were consumed with it. If you are physically able, be sure to walk up the cathedral. With over 500 winding steps that are not for anyone that struggles to walk, the panoramic view from the top is well worth the trek.

I would also recommend walking down to the bars and restaurants along the water. Cologne was a city we will be sure to visit again!",

During the war this was used as the focal point to bomb the city. Which is why only one corner of the cathedral was ever damaged, friendly bombing.

The majority of the cathedral has stayed intact from the time it was built. Each spire is generally being kept in maintenance here and there.

As we are here over the Christmas period its lovely visiting the Cathedral Christmas Market and enjoying a warming gluhwein and taking in the beautiful of Cologne Cathedral ,I still find it amazing that this church more or less escaped the bombing that devastated much of the city during world war two.
A beautiful cathedral, most definitely well worth checking out if your planning a holiday to Cologne.",

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Interesting Architecture,"The Cathedral dominates it's surroundings and adds a lovely feel to the Christmas markets sorted around the area. The architecture itself is a bit of a mish mash in the sense that there are clear differences in the style as your eye travels up the building. Apparently this is due to the length of time it took to build and the different parties it involved. The interior is quite grand, although very chilly so make sure to bring a coat! The bones of the Three Wise Men are said to be kept here, which seems to be it's claim to fame, although Napoleon is said to have used it to stable his horses at one point which I thought was much more interesting. It's definitely worth a visit, especially as it's free. An added and humorous bonus is the Roman wall and well which can be found in the parking lot just below the Cathedral which the owner did not deem important enough to stop construction for, so instead just built around.",

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,One of the Greatest World Man-Made Wonders,"This Catholic church was finished in 1880, after 632 years of construction work and it is nowadays one of the most significant pilgrimage places in Europe, due to its historical significance and priceless relics kept inside. Apparently. the sandstone covering the building walls reacts with the acid rain, turning a dark grey, and giving the edifice its blackish colour, in spite of renovations over time.
There are a multitude of areas not to be missed, once you enter the cathedral. Probably the most memorable is the South tower, accessible by elevator, otherwise by foot, if you dare the challenge to climb its 533 steps. From the top platform , you have an impressive view over the city, from a height of approximately 100 m. At the ground level, you need to wander through the large expanse of the naves, under the 43 m high arches ceiling, in order to see the main and two side naves, in detail. The decorations are exquisite. Then there are the choir ambulatory, the Shrine of the Three Kings behind the altar, and a few various chapels. Also, underground, accessible for and extra fee and by elevator, there is a treasury - where no taking pictures is allowed, holding holy relics, liturgical items, and works of art in precious metals and stones, some dating from the 4th century.",

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,just wonderful,"We stepped out of the station and there it was, right in front of us. Amazing and fascinating in its looming medieval glory. We had come, from Holland, just to see this.

It was the facade that made the first and abiding impression. Dark, but oh so detailed. We looked up, studying the details. Delighted by the life-like statues, the proportion and balance. We looked again and again. Wanted to step back some more to get a better perspective, but there was a busy traffic intersection. Not safe to walk into it looking at the cathedral. From the other side of the intersection, the view was blocked by large tour buses.

We walked around the back of the cathedral, had to to get to our hotel. We approached it from the south side, where much of the view was taken up by a concrete and glass museum that wasn't open. We marveled for a long time at the facade. We went inside.

Inside was just as balanced and detailed outside. The whole made a kind of sense, but the details were from different centuries and in different styles. Making sense and bringing pleasure along with the sense of history and reverence, but not quite fitting together as the facade did.

Not too noisy inside. Still room and time for meditation and worship.

We left, looking back on this hunk of architecture dumped into the city by history. Extremely imposing. You just have to design your city centre around it.

At night, from the hotel, we had a superb view of the floodlit clock tower. Unforgettable.","Written December 10, 2019"

Catholic cathedral church, located in the city of Cologne, Germany. It is the largest Gothic church in northern Europe and features immense twin towers that stand 515 feet (157 metres) tall. The cathedral was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.
The site of Cologne Cathedral has been occupied by Christian churches since about the 4th century. An older cathedral was destroyed by fire in 1248, and immediately thereafter work began on the present cathedral, which was designed in the Gothic style in emulation of French church architecture. The choir was consecrated in 1322, but construction continued until 1560 (or only until 1520, according to some authorities). The architects Ernst Friedrich Zwirner and Richard Voigtel carried out the enterprise, guided by architectural drawings made in about 1300. Construction finally ended in 1880.","Written November 23, 2019"

Such a huge sized cathedral is rare to see these days. We clicked some very nice photos in front of it. The security check is stringent and they strictly adhere to modest clothing. I was asked to cover my shoulders with a scarf they provided me at the entrance. The interior was beautiful. It was huge and so was the crypt. Loved it completely.,
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Vile treatment by staff,"I wanted a brief visit to the Cathedral. It was cold inside and I have managing a quite bad cold for some time now. For some reason I was targeted by a security staff member and asked to remove my wooly hat. I explained that I had a bad cold, but this seemed of no consequence to him or to the ignorant member of staff who turned up after a while. A deeply unpleasant, thoughtless piece of victimisation (there were a fair number of other people wearing hats).","Written November 22, 2019"
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Impressive piece of architecture,Very impressive to walk around both inside and out. Lots to see and you can light a candle to various saints. The church asks for a donation on entrance but you are not pestered or asked for money which was refreshing. Worth a visit.,"Written November 21, 2019"
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,My experience in the Cologne Cathedral with Erasmus+,"While my friends, teachers and I were headed to Giessen with the Erasmus+ project, we stopped in Cologne for a few hours. When I got out of the train station and looked to the left it was love at first sight : I saw the cathedral and I started smiling right away. The Gothic architecture was just breathtaking.
The interior, though, is the icing on the cake. I was smiling the whole time while I was walking through the cathedral. I've never seen such beautiful architecture before. It was a trip through the past : paintings, sculptures, catacombs, historical excerpts etc.
I really recommend going to the cathedral and admiring every piece of art and history displayed there. It was really an unforgettable experience.","Written November 21, 2019"
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,A must see in Cologne,"Impressive cathedral. If you are visiting by car, please note that there is a parking garage directly under the cathedral, clearly the best way to park if there's space.

The cathedral itself is very impressive... the most visited in Germany. They are currently doing some rehab work on the exterior, so you know that you'll need to be sneeky taking pictures so you don't have scaffolding in your way.","Written November 20, 2019"
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Visit there to experience....!!,"This is definitely one of the great cathedral that blends the best of aesthetic and gothic architectural designs.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,My experience in K√∂ln with the Erasmus+ project,"While on our way to Giessen, we stopped in K√∂ln for sightseeing and one of the attractions that cought our eye was the cathedral. The massive building is an excellent example of Gothic architecture. The building towers over the surrounding area looking ominous and elegant at the same time. The interior is just as mesmerizing as the exterior,life-like sculptures and paintings coupled together with the saturated colors of the stained glass windows animating the grey stone walls. It is a must see if you happen to pass through K√∂ln.","Written November 19, 2019"
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,A Must See,We took the quick trip from Dusseldorf to Cologne just to go here. It was worth all the time and effort. The stained glass is one of a kind. Do not attempt the spire climb if you are claustrophobic or uneasy with small stairs,"Written November 18, 2019"
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Speechless! Wow! Takes your breath away.,"I have seen my fair share of churches and cathedrals, but this one took my breath away! WOW! The sheer size and the extraordinary Gothic architecture is just amazing. I thought Notre Dame was spectacular, but this trumps Notre Dame in my eyes. You must see this if you are in Germany.

The Dom is literally outside the K√∂ln Hauptbahnhof, so it is very easy to get to. We spent about 2 hours looking at the Dom and taking photos. Even if you aren‚Äôt religious, this is a very tranquil place.","Written November 18, 2019"

For past 10 years we have come twice a year, every year during the Christmas Markets and there is no other place better.

If you want to go up in the tower go at opening. No one else is really there yet and you can just walk up without having to worry about anyone coming down at same time. Just sit inside and connect with the Dom....its amazing.

Stop by Gaffel and have dinner. Where else can you have amazing Kolsch, great food, then walk out to the Dom and the markets....simply heaven.","Written November 15, 2019"

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Spectacular cathedral and lovely landmark at night,"The cathedral dominates Cologne and doesn't disappoint with a visit - walking around the exterior is amazing in its architectural detail then the inside is simply a ""Wow"" moment. Intricate construction from stonework to glasswork to mosaic. Amazing textures in the stonework. But nothing takes away from the obvious palpable religious significance, the altars, candles and flowers and the many people in prayer paying their respects. Awesome and I'd go out of my way to return.","Written November 14, 2019"
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Even in Rain--don't miss this,"We had rain during much of our trip to Germany, but put your coat on and keep moving. The Cathedral had a very gothic look due to the rain.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,"Spectacular exterior, free entry","A stunning exterior with a far more sober interior, the cathedral is still worth checking out inside. It‚Äôs free entry but a guided tour is ‚Ç¨8. I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed in the tour as I wanted to hear a lot more on different sculpture and monument features in the cathedral rather than a broad overview of Gothic architecture (which I know a lot about already). Also the day I did the tour the choir was closed for confessions; why wasn‚Äôt this noted prior to tour booking?! Still seeing the Three Wise men relic is worth it.",
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Spectacular,This cathedral really does take your breath away and I‚Äôm not one for site seeing. Every time you look at it you notice something different. We also completed the climb of the cathedral and the view from the top is amazing. Staircase up is very crowded and if you don‚Äôt like heights it can get a bit scary near the top when the last stairs are open. Brilliant day,"Written November 12, 2019"
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,WOW,What a spectacular cathedral. Busy all the time so have some patience if you want the perfect picture.,"Written November 12, 2019"
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Amazing,The Cologne cathedral is the largest Gothic church in Northern Europe and has the second-tallest spires. The towers for its two huge spires give the cathedral the largest fa√ßade of any church in the world and what is the most interesting- during 4 years in the past it was the tallest building in whole world.,
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Stunning exterior,"I had my first view of this famous cathedral as we arrived on our Rhine Cruise, it was simply stunning. It is only a short walk from the river or the station and wherever you go in Cologne it dominates the skyline.

Some say it looks dirty, but I think the colour is part of its charm. It is amazing that it survived the bombing in World War II when so much didn‚Äôt. Our guide told us that navigators used the two towers as a navigation aid - don‚Äôt know if this is true.

The interior was nice but not spectacular, for me it is the gothic exterior that is so special. You can, for a small fee, climb 533 stone steps to a viewing platform for some special views.",

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Awesome,"This Cathedral is located in town. The Gothic artistry is stunning. Lots to see and be amazed inside. For us the best part was walking up 509 steps to the top. The views of the city were amazing. We also got to see the bells and towers up close. The walk up the spiral steps can be challenging. It's narrow and is the only way up and down. It can be a bit tight with people coming from both directions. Entry fee is 5 Euro. There is a rest room on the ground floor, .50 EU to access.","Written November 7, 2019"

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,A magnificent cathedral,"The cathedral has been standing here for centuries now and that was pretty obvious considering the top walls and spires all turned black from soot deposits. Only some parts of it could retain the original colour. The backside of the building was being renovated. It‚Äôs magnificent to look at though, and very big in size. We weren‚Äôt aware of the modest dressing norm here and so my wife had to cover up her shoulders with a scarf they provided. Once inside the cathedral the beauty was unmatched. It was a gothic masterpiece. We were lucky enough that a prayer had started when we entered and we did witness the ceremony. I totally loved it !!",
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Worth visiting,"Cologne Cathedral is massive and imposing, but its exterior is very dark and dirty (caused by soot from the nearby train station). It is certainly worth visiting (free admission), but not as impressive as I had imagined. The stained glass windows inside are beautiful, but the cathedral doesn't have the same warmth as other notable cathedrals I have visited. Luckily there weren't hordes of tourists the day we visited, and no service was being performed. Our excellent Viking tour guide provided lots of interesting, detailed information.","Written November 3, 2019"
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Most Beautiful Cathedral,This Cathedral is amazing. Its huge big and looks beautiful. Inside there is many to see. And the best thing is its free entrance you pay only for treasure room. Inside you can feel the history.,
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Spectacular cathedral,"Honestly the major reason we came to Cologne was to visit the cathedral. It was right across the street from the hotel which was very advantageous since it was lit up at night and its nice just to walk there and head back. The inside of the church is awe inspiring and a classic Gothic church. Since we were traveling away from the summer mayhem, it did not feel crowded at all. Don't forget to also look down since the mosaic floor is also and incredible work of art. The stained glass windows are to die for.
You also have to climb to the top. The entrance is just to the right of the church and outside the church. We did not see the sign initially and enjoyed walking around the church. You actually go down the stairs. If you keep going straight there is a bathroom. When you turn left at the bottom of the stairs you will quickly see where to start. There is a small gift shop as well. There is a 8 euro charge to climb and also see the treasury later which is cheaper than going to the doctor for a treadmill stress test. 533 steps later you are at the top. It was 60 degrees which made it so much easier. It would be far more difficult during the summer. We always carry a couple of bottles of water which for obvious reasons get lighter as we climb. Minimize what you carry to avoid extra torture. There was a couple in front of us and behind us which was nice since none of us were in a rush. I just can't imagine what the crowds must be like during the summer.
The view is spectacular and absolutely worth the climb. Felt absolutely safe up there though those with acrophobia may not feel the same way. If you want the full experience you have to climb to the top. There is also a crush penny machine at the top if you want a souvenier. Enjoy.","Written November 2, 2019"
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Worth to spend several hours,Enjoyed this museum although I am not a car fan. They have different type of vehicles made for different purpose. Only thing I don't like was the audio headphone: it is of the ear hook type which kept sliding off my ears.

No info on where Mercedes will bring us, the people that went after the founders, the major new innovations (the last one was about safety from 43 years ago), where Mercedes is produced, the current range, or why the fusion with Chrysler happened and then failed.

It is absolutely worth visiting if you're in the area, but it could be so much more.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,"Cars, history, multi-media in stunning architecture","The museum traces the history of the car from their inventors Benz and Daimler to concept cars of the future with amazing cars (many originals, some re-built), parts, displays and movies. You get a free audio-guide (German or English) and can move at your own pace and take in as much or as little as you want. You take an elevator to level 8 and take a spiraling way down through different eras. All is accompanied by displays covering world events and respective sound (i.e. clopping horses at the beginning or Rock ‚Äòn Roll in the 50s). Side galleries cover trucks, people transport, vehicles owned by famous people (including Lady Di and the pope) and temporary exhibits (I went to see the one celebrating 40 years G-Wagen). There‚Äôs a deli on the ground floor which you can also access to take a break and then re-enter the exhibition area with your ticket. The shop is accessible without entering the exhibition (no ticket required). The museum‚Äôs parking garage was full when I arrived, but right next to it there was another garage.
Local Covid-19 regulations mean wearing a mask is mandatory and contact details have to be filled in. There were automatic hand sanitizers all throughout the building and people mostly watched their distance. There are also museum guards on each level. A nice surprise was that when returning the audio guide you get to keep the branded lanyard (which usually would be sold...). I spent 2.5 hours and wouldn‚Äôt mind going again with visiting family or friends.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Feels like an extended sales tour,"The museum is based in an amazing building and attempts to discribe Mercedes history with European history.

However, it fails to really discribe clearly any of the engineering advances Mercedes have made. It also fails to really create an engaging narrative around the politics and history which Mercedes was affected by or helped effect. The first rooms jump back from the new engines to explaining how great were the dramatis personae and it all seemed disjointed.

The later rooms feels like a collection of the sales catalogues and that the rooms were compiled by public relation professionals rather than educators. After being in the vehicles dedicated to public service I was quite board of the museum

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,A Must See for Car Buffs or Mercedes Fans,"Wow, what a museum! We toured the old Mercedes Museum in 1994, and thought it was great, but this place leaves it in the dust! You start by taking an elevator to the top floor, and then walking down a gradual spiral to the ground floor, seeing all the displays arranged in chronological order, from the very first automobiles by Daimler and Benz, including the early engines, designed by Maybach. This is truly the beginnings of the gasoline powered automobile, and the history is well described on each display item in both German and English. If you're a car nut like me, you'll be thrilled by the tour, but even if you're not an avid car enthusiast, there's something about the history and development of the automobile, from the early primitive days, to the modern concept cars of the future that will appeal to almost everyone. And the displays are set in the context of world events of the times, including the company's role in production of military engines and vehicles for the Germans during WW2. There are also some interactive hands-on displays that are really interesting...I loved the one where you can hand crank a supercharger to see how it increased engine horsepower.

My feedback would be to have more opportunities for interaction. Why not provide stools or platforms so we can climb up and look inside the cars? How about some that we could actually get into, or pretend to drive?

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,"Amazing, Comprehensive Museum","Wow. Mercedes has spared no expense with this amazing museum. It is worth coming to Stuttgart just to experience it.

For starters, the architecture of the museum itself is incredible. I am sure you could take a tour just covering the architecture of the building. It is truly beautiful.

But the cars inside the museum are even more beautiful. The collection is fantastic and extensive.

We took an English language tour and it was well worth it. Our guide was a long-time Mercedes employee, who is married to one of the top Mercedes executives. His knowledge of the brand was garnered through a storied career at the company. I guess he just likes giving the tours for fun.

The tour itself starts at the beginning, the 19th Century that is. Mercedes-Benz has such a long history in the development of the automobile and the museum has cars, motors, and artifacts from every aspect of the continuing evolution. The tour gives a great overview of this history, but you could literary go back and spend all day looking at each car and reading about their history. There is some much to learn.

There is also a nice, if pricey, gift shop where you can find all things Mercedes.

A thrilling day at the museum.",
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,"Amazing experience, great museum...","We took two tickets for 20 eur. Yoy are passing floor by floor filled by mercedes exponats from beggining of their existence. I saw the BMW museum in Munchen, but this one is better from my point of view.",

It will require at least one day to really enjoy the museum if you are a real car crazy person. They have restaurants also(didn't try that option). Audio guides are available at the beginning of tour.Lockers are also available to keep your stuff/bags.
Even though we reached around 4:45 pm(ticket sale closing time is 5 pm), it was very crowded. So, initially they told that we can't get in. My 6 yr old son was almost heart broken as he came to Germany just to visit this museum. Still we waited along with many other people. Luckily, they reopened the gates with tickets on half price. My son was super happy and that made his day :-)..Thanks a ton to the officials for that kind gesture.","Written January 9, 2020"

Informative with mobile devices to explain everything you see. I will be going again for sure. ‚Ç¨10 for adult. Cafe on ground floor etc. Polite and helpful staff. It has to be the best collection of Mercedes in the world.,
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Excellent - history of the car and much more,Loved this museum - a quirky concrete building yet well laid out. From the first engine and car onwards. Loved celebrity cars and the audio-visual was good. My only niggle was not knowing whether to go left or right when moving between floors. Berthas restaurant is to be recommended too.,
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Excellent museum,"It's not necessarily to be a super big fan of automobiles to enjoy visiting this remarkable museum. First it's the architecture of the building itself that deserves to be seen and experienced. Then comes the organization of the whole visit, in which you don't have to to anything to get the audio guide telling you what you need to hear in the location you are at the moment. It even scans some codes on the floor to tell you details about certain exhibits.

The entire place is huge and covers a vast number of floors each with a theme. My particular favourite was the section where they showcased some of the cars that were owned by celebrities or important people of our time. The entire place can easily take up 2 or more hours of your time depending on what interests you. Each visitor is provided with an audio guide and you activate it by aiming the device at exhibits that interest you.

Remember not to throw away your ticket as it gives you a 10% discount should you decide to visit the Porsche museum on the other side of town. At the same time, consider having a meal at Bertha's located at the basement which is another experience on its own.","Written December 31, 2019"

I am a particular fan of early history, and the first part of the exhibit which showed the development of the very first automobiles by Benz and Daimler was captivating. Everything about this museum in terms of information provided (in both English and German) was very well thought out, including important events over the past three centuries. The curators are to be commended for including Mercedes-Benz's complicity in the atrocities of World War II . Obviously a museum for car buffs, I still believe that non-car lovers would find this a worthwhile experience. Some of the fully restored examples of cars from the 30s were just exceptional in terms of their beautiful lines.","Written December 19, 2019"

It was very informative but kinda boring... only cool part was the none main exhibit which showed other Mercedes-Benz items that celebrities/emergency service/buses used that one was slightly interactive to at least still be memorable now.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Comprehensive Retrospective,The museum is set up similar to the Guggenheim. One takes the elevator to the top where the earliest cars are kept. Walking down the spiral walkway the cars get newer. It appears that they have nearly every Mercedes ever made. The cars all look like they just came off the showroom floor. They are beautiful. I learned a lot about the history of the company.,

It‚Äôs simply fantastic, beautiful and for a very affordable price. Love cars, go there.",
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Only for car enthusiasts,"Seeing that the Mercedes-Benz Museum is the #1 rated attraction on TripAdvisor and with so many posts saying that it's a must-see even if you're not a car enthusiast, I decided to visit.

My thoughts:
- Incredible building. The architecture is what I enjoyed most about the entire visit. You start the tour by taking an elevator to the top, and then basically wind down around the building until you reach the bottom.
- Along the walking path, there are a lot of photo displays of important historical, scientific, pop-culture events that have nothing to do with Mercedes-Benz, but they provides some context to what else was going on in the world through the history of Mercedez-Benz. This was more interesting to me than the vehicles.
- There are plenty of vehicles to look at, as would be expected. But as a non-car enthusiast, I found I only wanted to see a sampling of each on each floor, as I wasn't all that interested in seeing every single one.
- This is a big museum. I rushed through it in about 90 minutes, because I had an appointment to make later that day. Would probably take closer to 3-4 hours if you saw everything.
- I would imagine if my kids were with me - they would find it pretty boring. I wouldn't recommend for young kids. The only thing that might have been cool is the racing simulators.

Overall, for a car or Mercedes-Benz enthusiast, this would most definitely be a 5 star attraction. But as a non-car entusiast, I thought it was OK for 10 Euros, but didn't find it all that engaging.",
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Informative and excellent car collection,"Had a few hours to kill on arrival to Stuttgart so decided to explore the museum. It was mid week, there was no crowds no queuing, was very easy to take photo. The exhibits are mainly touchable you really do get close.
Price is reasonable. There are a few cafes which again I was impressed with prices and a souvenir shop.",
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Rare glimpse of some of the most beautiful and historically important vehicles ever made.,"OK. Easy to find from the S bahn. Walk is about 750 metres, nicely signposted. Impressive purpose built building. Start at the top via a lift and wander down. Notv sure about the overtly politically correct history lining the walls. But I was there to see truly classic vehicles. I was not dissappointed. Each one beautifully restored or preserved. Have a look at the classics for sale before you leave. If you have ‚Ç¨95K you can get a 1980s 300SL! Prices went up to ‚Ç¨450K ü§§ All in all, well worth the ‚Ç¨10 entrance fee.",

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,"Nice building, nice cars, but audio guide not intuitive","We visited the museum 25th October in the afternoon. Unfortunately, there was a large event in the evening (Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the year 2019).
Due to this event, a large part of the lower floor was closed.
There was a lot of pressure to get everybody out at 18h00.

There were no general open guided tours this day due to ""capacity issues"". Only a special G-series tour was available.

The building is architecturally very impressive, but I do recommend to get a guided tour if possible. I think it's much more efficient then the free audio guide.

The free audio guide becomes uncomfortable for wearing after several hours. And it's not really a guide, but a kind of media player you can use to get spoken info at many points in the museum.
There are Wifi icons almost everywhere, where you have to point the guide device to the icon to get info. Unfortunately, there are more points then I liked where nothing happend.
Usage is not really intuitive (and I'm an IT specialist).
Audio often didn't start immediately, you had to restart the guide a second time to get audio.

Wheelchair accessibility is good, but the viewpoints in between the different floors have high railings. If you can't stand, you can't see very much at these overview points.

There are many unique cars in excellent condition in the museum, some more interesting then others.","Written October 28, 2019"

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Well worth a visit. Best car museum in Germany,"Being that there are so many car museums in Germany, you probably want to either prioritize which ones to see or just want to know which are the best. We did them all on our trip and for sure the Mercedes Benz museum was the best. It was the largest one, most interesting, all information in English, best tour guides, and imo best German car there is ;) beautiful building built across the street from VFB Stuttgart‚Äôs arena and training facilities, if you‚Äôre into football. I‚Äôd 100% recommend doing a guided tour since they give you more information and show you the highlights. If not, you could literally spend all day in there reading everything but I think the tour is the best use of your time as a tourist. Our guide took us through Daimler Benz history as separate car producers and then the ultimate merger later on. On display are the first engines ever invented, cars, trucks, vans, trains, boats, you name it and they‚Äôve got it. As you work your way down from the top, you gradually become more modern and that was for me the coolest part. Being able to compare their original models to the relatively new ones, then going to the basement to the brand new car dealership with all of their brand new cars. Parking is pretty easy to come by, either underground in the museum or on the street outside where it‚Äôs free. We liked this museum much better than BMW and Porsche but I guess it depends on which brand you like best",

Inside is a multi-story extravaganza of cars and history. Besides the beautiful, shiny cars (with each car's story in both German and in perfect English - no rough translations here!) there are historical tie-ins so you can learn what was happening in the world while the engines and cars were being invented and further developed.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Educational and Interactive,"This museum is very interactive compared to most museums. I really enjoyed the way the museum was designed in order to easily guide your way through the museum. When you first start your way into the museum, you are given a device similarly alike to an iPhone and earphone headset with a complimentary Mercedes Benz neck strap. On your device you simply choose your language and click start, you immediately start to hear an auditory introduction to your auditory tour. (No tour guide needed) You start at the top floor, with the historical/older models at first and as you go to the bottom floor you reach the most up to date models. Almost every car or gadget accessory will have a wifi symbol towards the description of each piece, if you see the symbol simply point your device to the signal, once you hear a vibration you will get 3-4 options you can choose from, of descriptive audio information relating to that specific model. I found this very helpful and great because you may learn at your own pace. Depending on how much information you would like to hear you can spend an average of 3-8 hours here.

There is also a souvenir shop, and cafe area at the end of the tour, along with a dealership - Maybach located on the top floor. If you go towards the back of the top floor dealership, there is an area interactive area where you can click on each model to hear what their start up engines sound like.",

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Amazing-must see experience,"I was reluctant to go as I‚Äôm not into cars, but I‚Äôm so glad I did. This is a beautiful well designed building that showcases not only the journey of Daimler and Mercedes-Benz over the years, but the history of the evolution of the automobile in relation to the history of the times in Europe and the world. The scope of the company in and around Stuttgart is mind boggling and I was lucky enough to do a tour of their factory at Sindelfingen as well. The museum offers information either by tour guide, headset or stories displayed on the walls. Seeing all the beautiful cars on display was nostalgic and impressive.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Must see museum for all ages,"This is more than an homage to the Daimler-Benz and Mercedes marques, it is a history of the development of the motor car and its place in the social history of Germany and to some respects Europe. The exhibition is over 7 floors accessible by a spiral walkway and lifts. So perfect for push chairs and wheel chairs. The audio guide is included in the price. This has quite a few languages and automatically explains the theme if a floor when you enter it. Thereafter you point it at a display board and get specific information. I particularly liked that you could hear General, Technkgical and Social and Childrens information by choice. The cares are immaculate with plenty of room to walk around and photograph without people being in the way for long. There are great 10 minute documentaries most floors with well selected archive film to explain the period of history covered by the floor. And of course the cars, vans and buses are to die for. There are 2 cafes, one on the ground floor and one on the first floor. They seem quite small for the number of people who visit, but the food was fresh and well presented. Mainly cake and filled rolls.
There is a small shop with well designed but overpriced branded merchandise. Plenty of parking next door but very expensive. There is some deal to get your first hour free which we missed so paid ‚Ç¨7 for 4.5 hours. In that time we didnt get through all the floors. Highly recommended, especially on a wet day.","Written October 3, 2019"

Each floor brings you into a different era of the automobile/Mercedes-Benz, moving chronologically from the beginning to the present. Side exhibits on each floor feature collections of specialty vehicles, such as buses, emergency vehicles, etc. This culminates in a final exhibit with Mercedes cars through the decades locked in a race around the walls.

Mercedes just has much more history to cover than Porsche, as well as, as wider range of products. Porsche was about racing. MB has its racing aspect for sure, which is at the end of the tour. But the majority of the exhibit is from the very beginnings of automobile production thru present. The walkways to the next section are sloped downhill so easy to walk and there are lighted panels that discuss history. I was happy to see that it wasn't all about Mercedes Benz. That is most certainly covered but there are world events that fit into the timeline as well. I really liked the cars from the 1920s and 30's. Classic.",

You take a fascinating time journey from the origins of the earliest designs by Carl Benz & Gottlieb Daimler, move on to the Silver Arrows of the 1950s, the F1 car, & finish with a glimpse into the future; all are represented in some way.

Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,Nice location but a strange way to run a business...,"My son and I are involved in the classic cars business in the UK and went to take a look at Classic Remise as we were in Dusseldorf. Lovely retail location but they let you wander around like its a museum.
A 308GTB caught our eye because it was an early, 'tall tyre' possibly vetroresina example and one of our customers was looking for one for his collection. As we were standing there an irate Gentleman comes out of a door marked 'Movendi' and starts shouting at the top of his voice in German. We look around (as does everyone) and it turns out he is shouting at my son on the other side of the car, who replied with ""I beg your pardon?!"" and shouty guy converts to English and shouts ""Yes you, don't touch the cars, don't open the cars!!!"" Now, my son is 27 years old, has several full restorations under his belt and has had his vehicles exhibited at a national level, he knows how to treat them and I was standing there with him, he didn't touch them let alone try to open the doors without asking. When he replied that he hadn't done anything Mr Shouty states ""YES YOU DID, I KNOW YOU!!!"". Quite bizarre as we'd never been there before. My son was concerned about the misunderstanding and went over to the office where Mr Shouty had retreated but he was now on the phone, maybe shouting at someone else. My son apologised to the other (polite) gentleman there that clearly they'd been a misunderstanding.

Shame, it's a nice venue but that's a strange way to run a business. If you don't like people getting near the cars probably best to lock them in a warehouse.

Despite hanging around for a bit Mr Shouty didn't come out so we couldn't set the record straight. Needless to say, we didn't buy the 308 either.","Written February 19, 2020"

From the moment you enter the car park you are in awe of the historic building that used to be a old train winding that could house up to 30 locomotives for storage and repair.
Walking into the building you pass the Ducati garage where the mechanics are working on bikes in all sorts of repair and will happily talk to you about what they are doing. Seeing some of the exotic machines in various states of repair gives you a good sense of what exactly goes into these.
Inside the there are cars everywhere. I made it very clear to my young family that this was a ‚Äúlook and don‚Äôt touch‚Äù place which they ably stuck too.
There‚Äôs so much to see here that you need at least 90 minutes to view everything, stop in the restaurant for lunch and then go back and look in a bit more detail at some of the classics. Although we didn‚Äôt eat, the food looked amazing and the cost seemed pretty reasonable.

There is also a second level and a restaurant in the middle.

We had lunch at the restaurant. Great meal and not expensive.",

The glass topped roof bringing in much natural light probably made this viewing more comfortable. They had so many classic cars on display and unfortunately some of those old cars would really reflect on how old I've gotten too! There are 2 floors to explore and quite a joy to view. There is also a cafe onsite which I did not try but had a beer at their patio whilst waiting for my friends. All in all an pleasant visit after all.,"Written October 29, 2018"

If you are a car enthusiast, I would definitely recommend coming to visit here. The building doesn't look that big from the outside, but once you get inside you will be surprised at how much space there is. The building was originally built to house trains a long time ago so it is built in a semi circle and has two stories. The vehicles there range from old (50 years ago approx.) to new less than 3 - 5 years ago. Some cars are even for sale so you could drive one away today!!!! Whats even better though about this place is that it's free to enter!",

The selection of cars is terrific - we saw many cars (especially some sports cars and antique cars) that we had never seen anywhere else. And for our kids - who had seen quite a few art museums and old churches during our trip - this was a nice change of pace. You need about 90 minutes to 2 hours to see everything. We also ate lunch at the restaurant inside the museum, which was quite good and reasonably priced.",
Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,Excellent - if a bit odd!,"As an owner of a classic car, I couldn't pass up the chance to visit Classic Remise particularly as it had good reviews on Tripadvisor.

It is part classic and modern car dealership, part repair workshop, part salesroom, and I think also part garaging space for top end sports and classic cars.

There are numerous makes of cars from Germany (BMWs, Audis/Auto Union, Mercedes, Porsche), USA (Cadillacs), Italy (Ferrari, Lamborghini) and Britain (Morgan).

It's free to enter and admire the multi-million pounds/Euros of cars on display.

There is a separate section for motorbikes, but seems to be mainly Vespas and modern bikes e.g. Ducati.

There are a couple of shops, one selling clothing and one selling books, memorabilia and parts for classic cars.

There's a cafe which serves decent food and drink too.

All in all a great way to spend an hour and a half or so if you're a petrolhead.",

Fascinating to see the glass garages and what people own! Like window shopping down Bond Street! Talking of shopping, there were a couple of retail outlets within the Remise but they were pricey. Excellent restaurant/bar/cafe with a subsidiary located outside where a waiter cycles back into the main restaurant to collect the hot orders. Prices were reasonable for food. Unbelievably FREE to enter. If you like cars of any era, then do visit.

Pretty straightforward to get to. We took the subway U-Bahn U77 and U79 direction Holthausen and got off at Provinzialplatz.

Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,Amazing mix of really cool cars,"Like it has been stated many times before this place is great. It rained all the way there and it was raining and cold outside during my visit but the Remise is warm and inviting with nobody pushing you along. The people inside are all there for the same reason and everyone is polite and generally in awe of the vehicles inside. It was Sunday so most shops are closed. The cafe was open and the food and desserts looked very good but I didn't partake since they don't accept credit cards. I am constantly amazed at how many places don't want my business because they only take cash. Sad but hey they must be making plenty of cash to turn people away. It didn't spoil my visit but if you want to partake then bring euros.
Great place and should be on the bucket list for all car lovers.",
Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,I'm not a car nut but this nearly made me one,"To be honest, the reason why I went here was the rating on TripAdvisor. I did not regret it though. It is located somewhat remote but still easy to reach with public transportation. (Btw. my bus did have a minor crash with another bus so I had to go the rest of the way on foot but hey, hopefully this is the exception)
The Remise is really for free and you don't have to feel like you swindle yourself into something. It is there to show off great cars / bikes and makes it money by selling them. When I was there most people present where tourists.

As I said, I don't know that much about cars but I really liked some of those on display. Most are rather old, but some are current models of super cars. The cheapest I saw was a Corvette for 30.000‚Ç¨, the most expensive was a Maserati for 740.000‚Ç¨. I liked the Corvette more but you probably have to pay the price difference at the next gas station.",

You‚Äôre free to just roam around and appreciate the range they have on display. Or you can always buy one, if you‚Äôve got a good quantity of Euro‚Äôs burning a hole in your pocket!

Dinos are a favourite of mine, although the Ferrari 308 has always had a lure!

Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,"Thank you, TripAdvisor!","We had already spent three weeks in northern and western Germany before we went to Dusseldorf, and we had been surprised how few Porsches we had seen in this area, even in large cities like Hamburg and Frankfurt. Of course there had been a few 911s roaring past our rented Ford SUV on autobahns and a few others we saw parked, mostly black new cars. There were very few older cars, and now we know where all the vintage 911s are!
. .
The night before we were to arrive in Dusseldorf, I was checking TripAdvisor for art museum opening hours when I noticed that the ‚Äú#1 of 173 things to do in Dusseldorf‚Äù was Classic Remise Dusseldorf, a ‚ÄúSpecialty Museum,‚Äù and the accompanying photo was of classic cars. As longtime Porsche owners, we were intrigued, and looked at the reviews and then the website.

We spent at least 1 1/2 hours there on our way into Dusseldorf. It was full of wonderful vintage cars in beautiful condition. There were only a few 356s, but very many older 911s of various colors, and even a 959 and a Porsche tractor. Plus Lamborginis, Maseratis, Mercedes, etc. Our thanks to TripAdvisor for steering us to Classic Remise, and we plan to visit the Berlin Classic Remise the next time we're there..",

Depending on how in depth you want to discuss each and every automobile you can cruise through in an hour or be here for like EVER!
Towards the back of the building they have restoration shops and there are several 'guy' stores where you can pick up some automobile themed clothing.

In my opinion it was pretty awesome experience for me as a car lover. And today's event - ""Oldtimers"", was awesome also. There war Oldmobiles, classic Dodge models, classic Mercedes models.... Just visit it and you won't regret.

When the visitor gets tired he can go outside the building for a coffee, sausages or a beer. It's nice and the people are kind and polite. I was able to get along with then in English without any problems.

There is also a restaurant inside the building with the view of the cars but I didn't try it. Above the restaurant is a second floor where the visitor could go and watch the cars from high.",

Germany,Main Tower,Definitely worth a visit,"Wonderful views from the Main Tower. Would definitely recommend.

Visited early afternoon on a Friday. There was no queue apart from a short one to go through the security scanner.

Platform has lovely views on a clear day. The restaurant / lounge also has great views and the opportunity to have a drink / some food. We only had a drink, so can‚Äôt comment on food.",
Germany,Main Tower,Still by far the observation deck in Frankfurt,"Opened in 2000, Main Tower is currently the fourth tallest skyscraper in Germany. What makes it special compared to other highrise buildings in the city, is that it has an observation deck at the top that is open to the public and offers great 360 degree views over the entire city.

As Frankfurt‚Äôs highest observation deck its views are unrivaled. However, the view towards the east (city center) will likely become quite a bit obstructed in the upcoming years with new skyscrapers being constructed close to the Main Tower.

For 7.50‚Ç¨ the entrance fee is a bargain compared with most other well-known observation decks around the world that often charge visitors between 20 and 40‚Ç¨.

What I also really like about this observation deck is the welcoming attitude towards photographers. Whereas tripods are banned at most observation decks, there is absolutely no problem whatsoever to take photos with a tripod here.

My favorite time to take the elevator up is about an hour before sunset. This way you can witness the sunset, the blue hour and the lights being switched on all over the city.",

One of first in a 10:00 am - not too many people in queue - so one tip may be to get there early to avoid crowds (and there is a security frisk to get through) Reasonably priced for the experience offered. Lift up (and down) is fast and silent - no real sense of speed- so remember look at the speedometer! Views from top-level viewing platform are spectacular. I was lucky it was a clear sunny day. Took several photos which are now screensaver/background images on phone and PC. All in all, a visit to Main Tower is recommended",

Germany,Main Tower,Great Views!,"Visited the main tower recently with my partner , it takes about 40 mins from the time you first que to buying your ticket and then finally getting through security , then you are taken up a lift to the 54th floor where you climb the remaining floors on your own to the top, the elevator was quite quick , however it can feel a bit claustrophobic because everyone is jammed into it, the views are amazing at the top and you can literally see all of Frankfurt, well worth the visit and a great opportunity to get some snaps of the city, we visited on the Saturday so it was very unusual to see the restaurant closed and no souvenir shop , the restaurant was advertised on arrival but nothing to say it was closed so it took away 10 mins of our trip to get the elevator there and then to realise it was closed , overall we were impressed with the tower but some small details can take from an amazing attraction!","Written November 18, 2018"
Germany,Main Tower,Beautiful views over Frankfurt,"Defenitly a must visit when you are in Frankfurt. Stunning views of Frankfirt from approximately 200 meters up the main tower. The price to go in is 7.50 which is worth it.

Germany,Main Tower,Good view of course!,"Good view when you finally get there. But the entrance is narrow, just one elevator worked so the line was long. Once you come up with elevator you still have a couple and more stairs to walk. The place cannot be made for sightseeing. But once up on the roof, it has a great view of Frankfurt.","Written November 13, 2018"

Germany,Main Tower,AMAZING VIEWS,"A very short walk from our hotel and from the main town centre and the 'Old Town' we took the elevator to the 54th floor Viewing balcony.

The 360 degree views are second to none, you can stay 'indoors' and take in the views, from behind large windows or you can walk up a few stairs to the open viewing platform where it is very safe (the furthest you could fall is about 6 feet to the balcony below) but you would find it tough to fall from the safety barriers, there are telescopes you can pay to use and map descriptions of what you are looking at, we were lucky enough to have a totally clear day (even in December) so could see for miles.

Well worth the approx. 12.50 euros we paid to go up there.","Written November 9, 2018"

Great place for photos, we probably spent nearly an hour up there. The Frankfurt Card saved 20% on the entry prices and the same for the Zoo.

Germany,Main Tower,A Highlight for Every Frankfurt Explorer!,"An architectural masterpiece in the heart of Frankfurt's skyline, the Main Tower is one of the highest buildings in the city built in 3 years between 1996 and 1999. After a security check, we climbed to the top of this 56 stories 240-meter high (including the antenna) building taking a high-speed elevator moving at 4 to 7 meters/second (for the first 190 meters and walk the last 10) for an incomparable 360¬∫ view of the city. The Main Tower consists of two high-rise buildings that are interlinked with one another. One is square, 170 meters high and the other is a round building 200 meters high with non-reflective glass. Our visit was on a sunny day so we got an amazing view of Frankfurt. The. best time to visit and shoot from this location is sunset when the view is phenomenal giving you a unique experience. This high-rise building is particularly popular with the people of Frankfurt as well as the tourists. It is the only one in the city that has a publicly accessible viewing platform with a restaurant. To help the visitors in identifying the prominent buildings and other attractions around the city, there are 4 ‚Äòinformation boards‚Äô placed at four sides of the top floor with their names. For about 45 minutes it is worth visiting this Tower for a stunning experience.",

Germany,Main Tower,Overrated,"I usually rely on Rick Steves and Trip Advisor for my travel advice. This time I feel they both got it wrong.

First, the entrance is not easy to find. Second, the entry price is much too high (thankfully, we had purchased Frankfurt city passes for the day, so we each saved 20% on the admission). Third, there was a lengthy wait tome (about an hour). I won't complain about the security check, since it's sadly pretty standard these days, but you can't use the lavatory unless you've passed through security first (did I mention the one hour wait time?).

Despite all these drawbacks, by far the worst was the old woman at the reception desk selling tickets. What a sourpuss! How in the world is this lady still employed? She is literally the first impression of the building when visitors enter, and she creates quite a negative one with her poor attitude.

Last, if I may be blunt, the city of Frankfurt view from the observation deck is just ""okay."" Unlike a view of New York City from the Empire State Building observation deck, there is simply nothing particularly emblematic nor nostalgically recognizable that would make it worth the trouble to deal with the rude employees, overpriced tickets, excruciating wait, etc.

I'd give it a miss.","Written September 23, 2018"
Germany,Main Tower,Worth the time. No wait at all on Sunday morning,"I went up on a Sunday morning. There was no wait at that time and the view was outstanding. The informational placards were clearly marked and identified specific points of interest. The one disappointment was the lack of facilities at the top. There was one bathroom stall each for men and women. So, even if the crowd was sparse on a Sunday morning, there was still a long wait to use the only toilet. Just plan ahead before going in.","Written September 19, 2018"

My security check was super fast, nothing like an airport. Just put my bag there but did not have to take my notebook out or empty water bottles. :) Yes, it may take a bit for the elevator to come, maybe 5 minutes, but that was okay. I was the only person in the elevator. I stayed until around 20.20 taking pictures. It was a great timing because I could see both the city with sunlight and then in the dark. Ticket costed 5 euro as a student. At around 20 o'clock, it got a bit fuller, more people coming to see the sunset and the city in the dark. I would recommend it.",

At 240m (or 787 feet) tall, the Main Tower is Frankfurt's highest vantage point with its observation deck, which also has telescopes, on the 56th floor. The top floor is reached via a very quick lift which made our ears pop a bit!. Main Tower is also interesting because it is the first fully glazed skyscraper in Europe, so there are great views from all floors & lots of photo opportunities. The regular entry price is a reasonable 7.50 euros, & you will get a further 20% off if you have a valid Frankfurt card.",
Germany,Main Tower,Great for an overview of the city but...,"...not as great as I had wished.

In the height of the summer, and on a Saturday night, for a photography visit, the main tower is not the best place to be.

Sun sets around 9.55pm, and it never gets truly dark until well gone 11pm. Even then the light hue over the Hills means there is still plenty of light around.

Also, since Frankfurt city centre is effectively closed down on weekends, the lights in the buildings are off so he shoot doesn‚Äôt come across as well as originally thought.

Having said this, you can still get great shots of the river, it‚Äôs bridges, Frankfurt main station, the airport, the football stadium, and the Radio tower.

Oh, it does get very windy (and rather cold) so be prepared for this.

Not at all the case, she started to be very rude towards me and my family (with one kid in the group), she was ironic and symply gave an awful treatment to a client.

The main lift takes you up to the 54th floor at a speed of 19km/h, which I think for a lift was pretty impressive.

Once at the top, you have to take a second lift up one more floor, before walking the final part.

I was surprised when we got to the top that there was a covering of snow on the deck, as it hadn‚Äôt snowed for a few days. Once we got out into the open air, the snow started to gently fall.

Germany,Main Tower,A must see in Frankfurt,"This was one of the most breathtaking places I visited in Frankfurt. I believe I paid like ‚Ç¨7.50 for the entrance fee. For this, you ride the elevator to the top, which seems to max out at a climb rate of 18km/h but it is not at all noticeable that you have started to climb. This is certainly one of the smoothest elevator rides I have had and merely takes a matter of seconds for one to reach the top floor at 190m high. From there you climb a few steps, I think like one or two storeys high to get to the observation deck which allows an all-round view over Frankfurt with some signage indicating some of the main buildings in sight. It was a gloomy day when I visited and can only imagine how nice it must be on a clear day. It was still really nice though.

Germany,Altstadt,Medieval Old Town worth a few days during the Christmas season,"The Alstadt (Old Town) of Nuremberg is situated between the Nuremburg Hbf station in the south and the Nuremburg Castle in the north. The Pegnitz River cuts across the city centre dividing Alstadt into two districts, St. Sebaldus north of the river and St. Lorenz to the south. The Old Town dates back nearly a thousand years and is a medieval gem of a destination.

We recently spent 4 days in Nuremburg and enjoyed sightseeing and dining throughout Alstadt. Historic churches that we most liked where St. Lorenz, St. Sebaldus and Frauenkirche. Of the museums around the city centre, we most liked Stadtmuseum im Fembo-Haus (City Museum). Kaiserburg N√ºrnberg (Nuremburg Castle) was another attraction that we really liked.

Along with the Nuremburg Castle, the city wall of Nuremburg is an excellent medieval attraction. Numerous well preserved towers, city cates and walls can be viewed. Similarly, there are numerous medieval bridges which cross the Pegnitz River that we liked. Most enjoyed were Museumsbr√ºcke, Karlsbr√ºcke and Henkersteg.

Another aspect of Nuremburg that we enjoyed was seeing the numerous statues and monuments scattered around the city centre. These range from tradition equestrian and seated statues of historic figures from Nuremburg including the likes of Albrecht-D√ºrer, Peter Henlein (inventor of the clock watch) and Kaiser Wilhelm I. We also enjoyed seeing some of the abstract and contemporary monuments around the city including the likes of Ehekarussell, Narrenschiffbrunnen, Dudelsackpfeiferbrunnen and Der Hase.

Lastly, we benefited from visiting Nuremburg during the annual Christkindlesmarkt (Christmas Market) which starts at Hauptmarkt and spreads through much of Altstadt in most directions. We enjoyed trying local specialities including Nuremburg sausages, lebkuchen and gluhwein - most enjoyed was Feuerzangenbowle from the booth with the giant cauldron. The city was excellently decorated during December as well, it was incredibly festive for the Christmas season.

In the end, we very much enjoyed our holiday in Nuremburg's medieval old town. There is plenty to keep you busy for a few days and longer for those who enjoy leisurely travel and more comprehensive experiences in destinations visited.",

Germany,Altstadt,Nuremberg Old Town,"We took a stroll through the Old Town of Nuremberg from the castle uphill through the castle opposite the main train station and beyond, and we marvelled at the beautiful medieval buildings and picturesque canal. Later, we visited a museum near the upper castle and we were astonished to see photos of the city of Nuremberg utterly reduced to rubble by WW2 bombing. The reconstruction of this beautiful city is simply amazing and it is well worth a visit for this reason alone.
Also, the transport system is integrated and operates with true German efficiency.","Written December 31, 2019"

I*ve never spotted as many nice places in Nuremberg as 'my' Canadians did, probably because I'm used to see the Altstatdt. They were completely fascinated
by the Burg, St. Lorenz, Sch√∂ner Brunnen, and many other attractions you can see in the old part of town. And of course the famous N√ºrnberger Rostbratwurst, the tiny barbecued specialty of Nuremberg.
As one dad was fighting in the Canadian Army in WWII, we also went to the Documentation Center, the building of the Nuremberg trial and the Zeppelinfeld.

There are a plenty to see and feel. Some of them are above, but some secrets are well kept during centuries beneath the cobblestoned streets like WWII bunkers and beer cellars, especially in Sebald district of the Old Town Nuremberg.
The most famous tourist attractions are well maintained and offer great photo-shooting spots for your memorabilia.
The city, which is almost 1000 years old, has suffered heavy bombings during the WWII, in which more than 90% of the old town was destroyed. After the WWII the city has started to rebuild ruins, some of them more or less successful.
Nevetheless, the city has risen like a Phoenix from the ashes.
Some of the most important and well-known among them definitely are: Frauentor, Lorenzkirche, Huptmarkt with Frauenkirche and Sch√∂ner Brunnen, Altes Rathaus, Sebalduskirche and Kaiserburg.

Germany,Altstadt,Nuremberg's Old Town.,"Situated on the banks of the Pegnitz River in the Bavarian region of Middle Franconia, Nuremberg owed its rapid growth due to its location on the key trade routes from one side. And from the another side, to its close relations with Emperors' court. Presence of Imperial court, even if temporary, attracted commerce and trade and stood behind development of crafts and art. In 1219 Nuremberg was granted ""Great Letter of Freedom"" by Emperor Frederick II, including town rights, privilege of minting coins and independent customs policy, among the others. With that, city soon become one of the most important trade centre on route from Italy to Northern Europe. Following centuries brought with them even larger expansion. The end of 13th century was witness to combining northern and southern parts of the city. Golden Bull of Charles IV from 1356 named Nuremberg as the city where newly elected kings of Germany must hold their first Imperial Diet increasing further city's importance. And finally, Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg ordered that Imperial regalia shall be kept permanently in Nuremberg, where they remained until 18th century. The flourishing of the free city of Nuremberg wasn't even hampered by numerous wars of high Middle Ages, and its cultural flowering in 15th and 16th centuries made it a centre of Renaissance in Holy Roman Empire. It was only the wars of 17th and 18th centuries that brought about temporarily slow down to the city's development.19th century, after Napoleon's fall, brought with itself revival of trade and commerce that made once again city prosperous. In 20th century, after WWI and along with rise of NSDAP, came dark card in city's history, but there's plenty of books written about it. And that's all about Nuremberg's history in great short. But what is left from its history? Remarkably, a lot. The great part of its city walls has survived, along with towers and gates. In the northern part of the Old Town can be found medieval churches of St. Sebald, and Our Lady. Not so far from Church of Our Lady, and on the other side of the Hauptmarkt square there's iconic Gothic fountain of Schoner Brunnen. To the north - east of Renaissance Town Hall can be found Baroque Church of St. Egidien and Pellerhaus. Further to the north west, there's Imperial Castle, and to the south of it, and next to the little charming square there's Albrecht Durer's house. Just to mention few interesting buildings of this area. A stroll along city walls, and then down the river, took us to Weinstadel (The Wine Store) located next to the Pegnitz River. Truly picturesque place. In the southern part of the Old Town there's also, a lot to see. Domed St. Elisabeth Church, so called White Tower (no longer white, though), and on the other end of Karolinenstrasse can be found impressive St. Lorenz Church. Outside of the southern part city walls sits Neo - Baroque edifice of Nuremberg's Central Station. And around 4 km to the south east from train station there's infamous Kongresshalle where NSDAP held its rallies, but we didn't go there.",

We had a very nice walk along the river that lead us right into the Altstadt where the Christmas Markets are. The main market in the Hauptmarkt is very large and very crowded. We also noticed that the prices here in Nuremberg are much higher for everything than in any of the other Christmas Markets we visited. However, it was certainly festive and there are several markets as you walk around the Altstadt. the neatest one being the Children's Christmas Market. It was different and nice. There are several very good restaurants within the Altstadt but make sure to have reservations made as they tend to fill up very fast as darkness falls. The Altstadt itself is very clean and well maintained and there were several bands and choirs singing during the day and as evening fell. I would recommend that you park somewhere outside the Altstadt and walk in. Much easier. The one problem we did encounter was that it was very difficult to find a public restroom.

Germany,Altstadt,Wonderful town especially at Christmas!,"Having had a brief taste of Nuremberg during a business trip I was keen to return with my wife to sample the Christmas markets. We visited in early December and stayed at the Le Meridian Grand Hotel, which is conveniently situated near the train station and just opposite one of the entrances to the old town. The town is steeped in history and gothic architecture, so visiting at any time of the year will provide an interesting short break, however visiting during the festive season to sample the Christmas markets adds another dimension. The Old Town is relatively compact and largely pedestrianised making it easy to explore the area. From our hotel it was a leisurely 10 minute walk past some impressive buildings, shops and eateries down towards the river and the Christmas markets (the main market in the square, a market specifically for children and an international market with stalls from around the world). Although very busy in the evenings, particularly at the weekend the general atmosphere was very friendly and relaxed. I recommend being in the square at midday at some point to witness the clockwork figures moving on the church tower as the bells ring out. The selection of goods in the market itself was amazing with a huge variety of unique hand made items - if you like Christmas save some space in your luggage for some incredible decorations and gifts! As you walk between the numerous stalls sampling of gluhwein and punsch, bratwurst and lebkuchen is highly recommended!
Apart from the Christmas festivities the Old Town has several museums that are of interest and a visit to the castle is worthwhile if you wish to learn more about the impressive history of Nuremberg. Although we did not partake ourselves, we noticed free walking tours in different languages were available and well attended.
There are numerous excellent dining options that get very busy at weekends and a reservation may be required to ensure a table at your preferred restaurant. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Nuremberg and are happy to recommend to others.","Written December 20, 2018"

Germany,Altstadt,Beauty!,"Nuremberg - centuries of history gathered here from medieval to recent times.
Architecture and art, old and new are blended now in the area of ""Altstadt"" - or ""Old Town"". Such a great place to walk and get lost in the architecture and the historical places.
Location - the Old city center - a combination of pedestrian streets and squares. So you can park the car nearby and enjoy a longer or shorter walk. Also is accessible by subway - you have the subway station right at the beginning of Koenigstrasse. Also the main railway station is nearby so you can come from outside Nuremberg by train is perfectly fine.
Sights - to list a few :
- St. Lorenz Church - look up my other review on the church for more details
- ""Der Schoene Brunnen"" - the fountain of wishes , - for details same as above.
- ""Hauptmarkt"" - the main square and still a functional market place.
- Women's tower right at the beginning of Koenigstrasse.
Architecture - Gothic is dominant but also the other currents are represented.
Altstadt - is well preserved and very nicely restored after the destruction suffered in WWII - due to the bombing.
Squares, statues, churches, fountains, bridges , towers, buildings - a lot of spots to be discovered.
Most of the landmarks can be visited without paying and entrance fee - but for those you have to pay they take cash and/or credit card so is no trouble at all.
Also you will find here restaurants - some several hundreds of years old - souvenir shops and not only - if you are looking for shopping you can find also some opportunities.
Overall is just perfect to stroll on the streets and admire the ""Beauty"" of the place.
Enjoy the Altstadt - is an excellent all day activity.","Written November 1, 2018"

Germany,Altstadt,A charming area belying its dark past,"Visited as an overnight stay right in the centre of the old town. Everything very walkable right from the train station entrance into the old town with cafes, bars and the Karstadt with supermarket just a short stroll away.

Points of interest regarding Hitler's Nazi occupation are included but the appeal, beauty and earlier historic focus of the area is much more evident as you wander through the village squares, plazas and around the old town walls, tunnels, arches and tors. (gates)

We asked for the printed map of the town (available from our hotel) which highlighted many points to check within the old town for those keen enough to wander.

The charming streets and cobbled lanes up to the Kaisernburg Nuremburg (an old castle and grounds with beautiful 180 degree views over the city skyline) displayed the beauty of the old town and city in a previous era allowing the mind to wander as you look into the past.

I was particularly impressed by the magnificence of the baroque cathedrals and early Germanic styles of architecture, with some in various stages of restoration from medieval to post war era. A photographer's dream!

Day or night there is plenty to see with most areas well lit and cathedrals and churches of particular note.

NB As with most areas personal safety is always important so if wandering particularly at night be aware of your surroundings and stay to the lit areas as much as possible.

Also wear comfortable flat walking shoes as the cobblestones are sometimes uneven, the grade up to the castle is gently climbing on one side and fairly steep on the other. None of these streets are good for heels or stilettos!

Something here for everyone but history, Arts and culture buffs will particularly enjoy. A place of charm, beauty and definitely worthy of a visit for a few hours or much longer.",

Bearing in mind that the city was badly destroyed in WWII, much of what you see has been rebuilt & restored. The main drag itself is a little over-commercialised for my taste, but if you dive off left and right it's a little more interesting.

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Antonio Vivaldi- A Mystical Musical Experience,"Writing this review is an absolute thrill and honor. Antonio had four other musicians performing with him for a crowd from the Viking River Cruise-Astrild ship. I wasn't sure what to expect until he led his crew into a classic composition that set the stage for what was about to happen throughout the balance of their concert.
I noticed something very different about Antonio and his crew, but couldn't put my find on it. Then, it became incredibly obvious as if some unseen spirit standing next to me turned on the lights. Antonio and most of his crew were not just playing the music....they were deep within the energy of perfectly balanced tones they were producing.
And, only one person seemed to have her eyes open reading her sheet music (the pianist). Everyone else seemed to have connected with one another perfectly.
This, in turn, provided a gift that I was not expecting. Decades ago, I had competed for a position as a teenager with Music Youth International based in Traverse City, MI. MYI sought the most talented young musicians in the USA each year and then when they were found, the perfectionists of MYI groomed them into some even better.
The lead master gave us all an example of what they were building towards by showing us all that you can, and must feel the music you are playing. It is a kind of meditational, spiritual experience. And, when you are successful in do this, you will find yourself merging as one with all of you collogues. The audience will at least sense this regardless of their background.
After the performance, I asked for permission to visit with Antonio and did my best to express my thoughts, my feelings, and deep appreciation for what he and his crew had accomplished.
To say the experience of being with them was unique is truly a gross understatement. If you choose to attend any of their concerts, you will be more than entertained!","Written October 27, 2019"

Stunning place.",
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Amazing place,,
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Great Palace and Museums,"The Zwinger is top notch, but let me do a little explaining first.

Unknown to me before our trip, Dresden was a city of great art and culture in the 1700s. The closest equivalent is maybe the Romanovs in Russia before the revolution. This palace is one of the great works of architecture destroyed in the bombing raids of December, 1945, but rebuilt once East Germany fell. The building is amazing architecturally, but also houses three museums, each worthwhile in its own right.

First, you can walk around for free and it's certainly worth the time.

There is an old masters museum, but it's being renovated. We had the bad luck to be there when almost none of the works were on display. If seeing the art is important to you, you'll want to check ahead (although there are other art museums in the city you can enjoy as well).

The other art museums are for porcelain and scientific instruments. The porcelain is beautiful and I'm saying that as someone who ordinarily isn't that impressed by it. The Soviet Army stole much of this, but it was later returned to the city in the late 1950s as a kind of peace offering to the citizens of East Germany. You can see both German and Russian numbers on many of the pieces.

The scientific instruments are really cool. If you're at all into astronomy look in particular at the instruments they used to track planets. The instruments are also very artistic in their own right. Take a look at the automaton bear while you are there - it's amazing what they could do with 18th century technology.

The separate residence palace is in another palace more or less across the street. That one contains attractions such as the Green Vault (old and new) and many other displays. It's easy to see them both on the same visit but the sheer amount of amazing stuff suggests that you see them on different days.

This is a great sight and a symbol of Dresden's rebirth following the massive WWII bombings.",
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,A must see when in Dresden!,"Zwinger contains three museums and beautiful gardens. The gardens and surrounding buildings are beautiful and you can climb the terraces for stunning views. All the museums contained interesting artifacts with info in both English and German. I'd highly recommend giving this a visit if you're in Dresden.

You can walk through the gardens and admire the buildings for free but you need to pay for admission for the museums; if you plan on going into the museums I would recommend the Dresden Pass which costs ‚Ç¨22 for the all museums in Zwinger and the Royal Palace (note the 'Old Green Vault' is not included in this). Plan for around half an hour to an hour if you are just walking around the gardens and around half a day or more if you plan to visit all the museums.","Written August 10, 2019"

Both are worth a visit, and the ticket to visit both costs around 12 euros. You also have the option to simply walk up to the second floor of the terrace to take some awesome photos instead.

If you have time and enjoy art go for it! If not, the outside may suffice.",

Painting collection lovely. Some of them are part of classic education, some are just lovely to watch.
As a fan of Tintoretto, was pleased to find his work there as well.
Place to sit and rest in some rooms, not all. A bit of a line to the top floor- faster entrance for a group.

Concession tickets with proper documents- disability or student card.",

Upon arrival at the ticket desk, we were spoken to (can‚Äôt even say greeted here) by a very rude female member of staff. She didn‚Äôt even smile and say hello. We had seen on the ticket prices that they did concessions so naturally asked for 1 concession and 1 standard ticket. We we stunned by her rude response when she said ‚ÄúWHAT merit do you claim concession!?‚Äù We said that mum was 75 and she just tore strips off us saying that we shouldn‚Äôt ask for that as it‚Äôs for disabled and students only.

The gallery itself is good, but if you bend down to try and read the descriptions of the paintings, alarms go off and staff come and tell you off. Not fun.

On the way out, we looked for the exit and a lift. I found a sign that had a symbol for disabled access and a lift and was told by a very rude Male member of staff that we couldn‚Äôt use it so my poor mum had to suffer the stairs.

There are very nice views from the 2nd level terrase, being accessible from a few entrances.

The Nymps bath fountains were not in function when we visited, but still a nice area (behind the entry to the left if getting in by bridge door)

It is an impressive building with 2 main collections: Old Masters paintings and the Porcelain Collection which was outstanding and my favorite. The paintings were subdivided into 2 sections one of which was the Renaissance collection which I found least Enjoyable as it had repetitious religious themes . How many pictures of Jesus, Mary and Joseph in Med-eval attire can you look at? And there were Many. In the old Masters I particularly enjoyed the pictures of Old Dresden.I was told that this was Dresden's main attraction but to be honest, The Residence was far more rewarding. The Zwinger

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Grand Baroque Palace with Unique Collections,"Taking a day trip to Dresden from Prague, the Zwinger wasn't our first choice of museums but it turned out to be our highlight of the day. The Royal Residence was closed for renovation and the Zwinger was our alternative to see Saxon heritage and treasures. The reconstructed complex is built in true extravagant Baroque style. The walk across the balconies is glorious even the dreary winter days. In saying that, I'm sure it would be even better in summer when the fountains are in full swing.

The three museums in the complex are all unique and has something that suit everyone's tastes. We spent the least time in the Old Master's Gallery. Whilst it is an extensive collection, we were spoilt by other great galleries across Europe. The Porcelain Collection is one of it kind. It brought us to a journey into the history of European porcelain from Augustus the Strong's far east collections to its development in Meissen. It was my first experience of a porcelain museum and it was fantastic. The Royal Cabinet of Mathematical and Physical Instruments is also fascinating with intricate clockwork and instruments. The museum is also really interactive so visitors can experience the development of science over the centuries. The Zwinger is a complex where you can spend hours at, whether to admire the Saxon collections or just enjoying the Baroque architecture - definitely one of the must dos of Dresden.",
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Breathtaking and well equipped for tourists. Must visit!,"I would advise not to bring a lot of stuff: big backpacks, suitcases, winter clothes. Lockers are relatively small and very secure. No selfie sticks allowed into the museums. However taking photos, in most galleries, is allowed. Ask stuff in-advance. When you are IN, try to get those electronic guides - very helpful and informative. You can find them right at the entrance to every museum. There are several museums. So some homework to be done beforehand to prioritize your visits. In general - must visit place. Especially paintings. Even for those who know nothing about paintings, like me. It is still amazing... timeless!","Written February 23, 2019"
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,A powerful statement,"This beautiful Baroque monument is in every art history book and like all of Dresden, it refers to the powerful reign of the Saxon dukes in the 18th century and their interest for not only collecting art but also attracting artists to work and for education. The collection of old masters is outstanding and presented in a way you can enjoy at ease- not too many spaces and floors.At the same time the completely rebuilt monument refers to the destruction of the city at the end of the Second World War, Dresden is still rebuilding its former grandeur and has remained somewhat silent, like you are thrown back in time. .",

Wide and expansive, the gravel paths led you to the entrances of the collections that Augustus displayed there. For example: art paintings and porcelain. Appreciate the separateness because like the Green Vault, there is too much to take-in.

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Stunning gardens,Stunning garden that is worth walking round. No entrance fee and a nice break from the hustle of Dresden.,
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Do not miss this magnificent Baroque architectural masterpiece,"Begun in 1707 and completed in 1728, the magnificent Zwinger is a baroque architectural masterpiece designed by Augustus the Strong's court architect Matthaus Poppelmann and decorated by the sculptor Balthasar Permoser and an army of artisans who fashioned the over the top ornamentation. With six linked pavilions, lawns, pools, fountains, and a massive courtyard you could easily spend hours, days, exploring the Zwinger Palace.
Do not miss the Glockenspiel pavilion which holds a carillon of 40 Meissen porcelain bells that ringevery fifteen minutes-on the day of our visit Vivaldi's Spring was the musical selection.
Take one of the wide staircases to the open second floor walkways for expansive views of the courtyard and up close looks at the carved garlands and statues.

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,A Phoenix City,A city that has risen from the rubble. The Palace has been reconstructed into impressive buildings. The courtyard and fountains are impressive. There is much to explore at this location.,"Written July 8, 2018"
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Baroque architecture is eye candy. Other attractions clustered nearby makes for a packed day of sightseeing,"The site is impressive! The baroque architecture was ""in your face"" and eye candy for me. We took about 30 minutes to stroll around the immense courtyard to take photos of the appealing sculptures which were everywhere on the buildings - roofline, walls, gates, around windows, balustrades, columns, cornices, and fountains. These sculptures are of a whimsical nature - playful mythological characters and cute cherubs - no saints, religious figures, or even royals. It was designed to be a pleasure palace after all.

There are at least 3 entry/exit gates to the site. There is no admission charge to walk around the courtyard to see the exterior of the buildings. We used the Crown Gate so called because of its crown and other royal insignia piled over the archway. This entry crosses a moat (now filled with greenish water). There is no drawbridge apparatus though in the tower - just beautiful sculptures. The other access points are by Theaterplatz where the Semper Opera and Hofkirche can be seen and through the Bell Tower on Sophienstrasse to visit the Residenzschloss and the Furstenzug.

Immediately evident upon entering any of the site's 3 entrances, visitors see the layout. Four large corner buildings connected by lower wings surround a central courtyard filled with 4 patches of geometric lawn shapes and 4 fountains. All the buildings, their connecting wings, and entrance towers have repeated rows of arched windows and openings which make a strong statement. Unfortunately, the sandstone used in the reconstruction of these buildings is beginning to darken.

The courtyard on my visit contained no flowers - just geometric shapes of mown lawn surrounding the 4 fountains. Wide pathways, mainly fine gravel - no cobble stone here - divide the property into quarters with the 4 low, but wide, fountains placed at the center where the paths cross. Tubs of low growing trees similar to those found in Orangeries were placed in this area. This site lacks shade trees - little shade other than that provided by the buildings and no benches for lingering. On my visit, the single spouting fountains were turned off around 4 pm.

One outstanding structure was the bell tower, easily recognizable with its gold framed clock and rows of seemingly small white Meissen bells. With a zoom lens, one can see the Meissen trademark of the 2 blue crossed swords around the clock. Fittingly, the entry to the Porcelain collection is in that tower . Go up the stairs to buy the ticket (6E) and while you are up there, step outside on to the roof terrace for a walk around. This is the spot to take ""aerial"" photos of the site.

If you want to visit the 2 museums holding the collections of art and porcelain, be familiar with their location on the site in order to save time retracing steps as I didn't see large signs outside the buildings (for obvious reasons). While there is no charge to enter the grounds, the 2 museums do have an entry fee - the Porzellansammlung (6E) and the art gallery - the Gemaldegalerie. I visited the porcelain collection using up another half hour to admire the 2 collections of Meissen and blue and white Chinese porcelain. The museum is on one floor. This wing displaying this collection is lovely - full of light streaming through rows of arched floor to ceiling windows, white walls, and marble floor. If you want to see what the interiors of the buildings are like, pay the museum admission price.

Once at the Zwinger Palace, the other attractions are close by - the Semper Opera, the HofKirche, the Residenzschloss, and even the Frauenkirche further along Auguststrasse which also has the 24,000 tiled League of Prince - the Furstenzug. All great attractions for a packed day of sightseeing.","Written July 8, 2018"
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Party Place of the Royals,"A must see in Dresden, this is the former party palace for the king and his court.

Some of the wings of the surrounding buildings are museums, but check which days they are open. Fantastic place for pictures.","Written July 6, 2018"

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,"Old Masters, bad presentation","New facilities, good layout, good standard of art works, CRANACH especially well represented. However, all is spoilt by small print labels, set so low you have to kneel to see the text, then, of course you upset the alarms because you have got too close! Then the old GDR scowl from the gallery guards creates a tense atmosphere. None of them acknowledged my comments about these signs, probably also not a lot of english is understood?
Also, many paintings are crammed in up to 5 meters up walls, and with varnished surfaces and high lighting these are almost impossible to see, unless you stand back 15 to 20 meters and loose details.

These are serious detractions and are easily addressed. Fixing the lighting will take money and time, but is worth attention as well.","Written July 4, 2018"

Swinger is much more bigger as it looks, comprises muzeum and a-lot more.",

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Wonderful baroque architecture,"I find Dresden one of the most beautiful places in Germany. So far, I have not seen ""every"" corner of the country, but Dresden will probably stay in the top 10..

The Zwinger is one of the gardens that shows how elegant and spacious baroque architecture was. My favorite place was the fountain of the nymphs where the sculptures seem to be enjoying themselves, then you have the wonderful vertical fountain that is perfect for a romantic photoshoot.

Loved it and highly recommend it when you are visiting Dresden!",
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,The high spot of my visit to Dresden.,"From the moat - complete with a heron - to the panels of detailed relief carving, I enjoyed every aspect of the Zwinger. There is quite a lot of it, and it is very well-kept so a pleasure to spend time taking in the many, and varied, architectural features. One can wonder around at leisure, without paying entry fees. Even in November we found it a pleasant spot for a picnic lunch while taking in the vistas.",

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Baroque and beautiful,"When no construction or restoration takes place, the construction as a whole is simply beautiful. The baroque style can be found in all little details like fountains and statues and shapes of the facades. While the middle area is normally crowded with tourists, you can also get to the top and walk around there. There, you can also find moments to yourself.
Inside you can find the famous art gallery and porcelain gallery. Overall a place I would go again and again even if it is just for a short moment.","Written January 11, 2018"

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Great day in Family,"We wanted to have a weekend break with our two kids from 4 and 11. We decided to visit Leipzig specifically because of its zoo. Compared to other top European zoo, we found that the 54‚Ç¨ family ticket was great value for money. We stayed from 9h30 to 17h30, almost from the opening to the closure. The kids enjoyed alternatively watching the animals and the playgrounds. For each playground, there is coffee place, snack or restaurant making the visit and a great experience for everyone.",
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,World class zoo but lots of inconsiderate visitors,"I have family in Leipzig and have been to the zoo many many times. It is one of the nicest zoos I know. The animals seem happy, the enclosures are fairly big (thus sometimes you won't be able to spot an animal but it's important to give them the option to hide so I don't mind that at all) and theres a large variety of animals you can observe.

This is the first time I have been to the zoo since Covid and it wasn't as great an experience as it used to be. Firstly, in order to comply with the 2G rule, visitors had to queue to show their Covid status. The queue outside followed the main road and it took us approximately 45 minutes to get to the entrance. That's 45 minutes standing next to a busy road with a fed up toddler. Lots of peoole around us were smoking which made the experience even worse. No one was keeping their distance either (mind you, we would have probably ended up in a queue up to the H√∂fe am Br√ºhl if people had kept their distance....).

By the time we made it to the entrance our son was quite fed up. I think it would have been better to introduce a system that allowed people to book an arrival slot, e.g. 9-10, 10-11, 11-12 etc. to avoid thhis ridiculous queue.

Once inside, people were not following the rules very well, especially when it comes to distancing. My son got pushed around quite a bit. We also visited one of the restaurants and I deeply regretted it later. It was the Marche next to the giraffe enclosure. It was madness. People were hopping all over the place and at the salad bar a lady got so close I was close to asking her to get me drink first, she was literally leaning on me. The food was mediocre but very expensive. I would definitely get fries or a Bratwurst from one of tye many huts next time.

The B√§renspielplatz was an absolute highlight for our son! He absolutely loved it.

In short, it is an amazing place, eell worth a visit but I think there were too many people,especially since everyone wanted to enter more or less around the same time.",
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,"Fine, not worth a special trip.","It‚Äôs a zoo, a typical zoo? I‚Äôm from Ireland and it is just as good as Dublin zoo. I don‚Äôt think it is worth ‚Ç¨22... a lot of the animals were impossible to spot when we went (morning into early afternoon).

So yeah, worth seeing if your in Leipzig for a few days, but not worth going to Leipzig for the zoo!","Written September 25, 2021"
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Overrated and expensive.,"There were simply too many visitors allowed into the zoo and crowds and long queues were formed everywhere where the animals were...not only that, there were very few animals to be seen in each category of animals...I've been to many zoos in the world..Singapore zoo, Prague zoo etc..the price person for this zoo is too expensive.","Written August 12, 2021"
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Worth the visit,"In my opinion the long journey to the Zoo Leipzig was definitely worth it.
Right at the entrance I was pleasantly surprised. We didn't have to queue, as it is often the case in the other large zoos. Moreover I also find the entrance fees to be rather reasonable.
A lot of the buildings and animal enclosures are from earlier times, but most of them are spacious. The zoo is divided into individual themed areas that are adventurous and authentically designed.
My highlights include the world's largest great ape enclosure (Pongoland), the Kiwara savannah and of course the enormous Gondwanaland. Where else can you find a real 1.5 hectare jungle with a large variety of animals in the middle of a huge city?
In Pongoland, which is one of the themed areas of the park, you can take part in a virtual safari and in Gondwanaland you should definitely not miss the boat tour.
Furthermore there are also many restaurants and small food stands where hunger can be satisfied at a fair price. The toilets are very clean and you can decide whether you want to pay to for using them.
In conclusion I do think that the Leipzig Zoo is worth every penny that you pay and is one of the most beautiful zoos that I have seen so far. I can definitely recommend the Zoo Leipzig.","Written May 19, 2021"
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Too crowded,"We loved the layout of the zoo, it was well thought out with a good selection of animals on show and good facilities. However the zoo was much too crowded with no consideration for social distancing during the Covid pandemic, this was very disappointing and absolutely ruined our visit. I think the zoo is very irresponsible in letting this many people in.","Written October 7, 2020"

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Best Zoo,This is one of the best Zoo in Germany. We spent a whole day there and still covered only half of it. Worth visiting.,
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,World class zoo!,"I just spent the day at Zoo Leipzig with my 3 daughters, ages 10, 13, and 17. What a fantastic place! It took us about 6 hours to get through the entire zoo. As with most city zoos, space is at a premium, but this zoo is laid out well, the animals seem very happy, and there are multiple viewing opportunities at each exhibit. Nearly every single plaque is fully translated in English too, which is really great. Also, there are many Coronavirus precautions in place. Lots of sanitizing stations, and masks are required in all the buildings. Definitely a great way to spend the day! Highly recommended!!","Written July 31, 2020"
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Very friendly for humans and animals,"The park itself is located near to the center. It is tidy, clean and the animals have enough space to live their life. The variety is outstanding. They have so many different species. It really is a place where you must have been. Also good for kids but if they aren‚Äòt that willing to walk for long dinstances you better bring a buggy along. You could also rent a vehicle to pull them around through the park. I can highly recommend this place. But make sure you are there quite early. A face mask is recommended but not obliged. In the park and its different houses.",
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Great day in Family,"I liked the Zoo and I would definitely go back. But there wasn‚Äôt much energy with the animals. They were there, but maybe we just showed up during nap time, because there wasn‚Äôt much action at all.

But the whole family enjoyed it and we would definitely go back.",
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Absolutely worth a visit,"Amazing variety, well done and seems animal-friendly.

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Good but shares the faults of all zoos,"After reading the reviews I had hoped this would be different.
I visited on a surprisingly warm dry day.
Gondwanaland is well presented and signposted. There are some quite big fish in relatively small tanks. These are found along the path leading to the main attraction which is the large tropical greenhouse. The space features animals from different continents and it's all well labelled. A few bats were flying around and landing in the trees. Other animals were in enclosures.
The rest of the zoo is more typical. There is a large great apes house with what appears to be moderate outdoor space. The tigers seem to be less fortunate and pace constantly with little distractions.
Because it was winter quite a few animals were not seen.
Although efforts have been made to increase enclosure space when all said it is a zoo and these wild animals have been caged.
There is a good select of eating areas as well as cafes and restaurants
If you feel zoos are acceptable then this is one is good and almost certainly better(and need longer to explore it ) in the summer months","Written February 1, 2020"
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Amazing day!,The ZOO is really big and there is a lot to see even in winter. There are a lot of animals speecies and their habitat is well taken care of. It is worth to visit it!,
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Brilliant day out,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit on a damp December day, the boat ride around the enclosed Gondwanaland was good fun and the animals appear to have a good amount of space and seem to be in good condition and as content as being regularly fed and safe from predators is likely to make them.","Written January 28, 2020"
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Worth the visit,"Being from San Diego, we are snobby about great zoos. But that place measures up well. Yes, it is under construction, so there are some inconveniences to consider. But overall, very well laid out and inhabited. Various exhibits took you inside where it was nice to warm up on a chilly day. Loved the monkey exhibit with the critters climbing about above us. (At least we weren't peed on, like the little girl ahead of us.) We passed on the Indiana Jones-style boat ride but it looked fun for the younger set. Due to the cold weather (and as it got later in the day), so inhabitants were hiding out of sight. Nevertheless, worth the visit.","Written January 9, 2020"

The animals are well looked after and have space to roam. They are well monitored here. The restaurant was excellent with so much choice and the toilets were clean too. There were lockers available to store anything you didn‚Äôt want to carry around for a euro which was refundable. Our favourite area was Pongoland watching the monkeys! We could have watched them for hours! A great day out and if I lived here I‚Äôd definitely buy an annual pass. There are lots of play areas too if you have younger children.","Written October 9, 2019"

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Modern zoo with very innovative forms to enjoy a visit,"Zoo Leipzig has always been one of my favorites. It is impressive to see how much investment is flowing back into developing the zoo!

At times, the intense renovation becomes obvious. Yet, not only does the zoo manage to navigate its visitors around the major inconveniences, but also it wins you over with a fresh and comprehensive experience, once the renovation is finished.

We cam at 10:00 and we had to wait more than 20 minutes to even park the car. So be prepared as there is many people there. Rest was super fun because of 2reasons: 1 Gondwanaland is a super nice place and it seems to be the only one of this size in EU. for 1,5 EUR you can take a small boat tour and feel the climate of the tropical rainforest. 2. Pongoland with a huge area for monkey's. Also in term of food, there were few places to eat not just fastfood.","Written September 16, 2019"

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Hands down...the best zoo I've ever been to,"This is definitely the best zoo I've ever been to. It's divided into themed areas such as Asia, Africa, Pongoland (home of the apes), and Gondwanaland (tropical rainforests from 3 continents), etc. Most enclosures resemble natural habitats where you can see different species living together.
For me,the most exciting of these areas was Gondwanaland (a rainforest under roof). You can take a boat tour on a jungle ""river"" or cross over a suspension bridge to a viewing platform above the canopy...a super cool experience.
Though the tickets are a bit expensive by American standards, a visit here is well worth the price. Additionally...the zoo has free wheelchair rental and just about everything is accessible.","Written April 23, 2019"

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,One of the best zoos anywhere!,"If you or your kids are at all interested in animals, this is the best zoo I've been to. For about 20 years they've been investing heavily in converting old enclosures, adding new areas, and greatly improving animal welfare. If you've young kids and live in or near Leipzig, a season ticket is well worth it so you don't feel you've got to stay the whole day. Sometimes we used to go just for the great, clean playgrounds! The only negatives are that it can get very crowded in the school holidays (no wonder as there are free tickets for holders of the Ferienpass!) and the food and drink are a little pricey and often ""not quite what you're looking for"" so you might like to take your own.

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,"Lovely, well designed zoo with mostly excellent enclosures","My wife and I visited the zoo predominantly to see the two Formosan (Chinese) Pangolins that are resident, the only two Pangolins in the whole of Europe. The Pangolins are in a small enclosure in the elephant house, and we were delighted to see them being very active. The best time to visit is a Monday as they get weighed, so it is a guaranteed sighting.

The zoo also has many other rare animals, such as Snow Leopards, which have a lovely enclosure in the Himalaya themed part of the zoo, (complete with Buddhist prayer flags...). Our other favourite zone was Gonwanaland, which was a large dome covering a rainforest set-up, which had various tropical birds, monkeys, Tapirs and bats. There is a boat trip round an artificial river (that costs an extra Euro or so, but was worth it to see the animals from a different perspective), and there are a couple of high walk ways too to give a birds-eye view over the vast enclosure.

Unlike most zoos, the quality of food available is exceptional too, with themed restaurants depending on which zone you are in. We ate in the Gonwanaland enclosure, and had a fantastic Asian broth and dumplings, which was cooked fresh in front of us - much better than the usual burger and chips fayre at most zoos, and very reasonably priced too.

The majority of the animals had excellent enclosures, although I would say the Hyena's one looked a little small and he was exhibiting quite stressed behaviour as a result, but on the whole it is one of the finest zoos I have ever been to.","Written November 12, 2018"

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,The animals are not in the cages at this zoo,"I went to this zoo after reading that was one of kind, modern and unique. Unfortunately there was some unpleasant situations that I did not expect when you visit a zoo. The worst was that everywhere I went there was people smoking! I can not understand how is this allowed at the zoo; for the sake of animals, children and cleanliness this is extremely inappropriate. The manner in which some children and public behave towards the areas where the animals are without a protective glass is disturbing: they shout and annoy the animals (there is signs saying DO NOT DO THIS but nobody to enforce them).
The idea to have thematic restaurants is a good one, however one of them is so big that seems that we are in a shopping mall and the beautiful giraffes, zebras and other fabulous animals are just nice background...not there to be appreciated, admired or with a bit of luck, learn something about them.
Many descriptions are only in german and one woman working at the jungle area was upset because I excuse myself ( in german) for not speaking german.
Sincerely, I did my best to learn and try to observe the animals, fish and birds and with a bit of patience and turn a blind eye on the obnoxious public could be a nice visit, but be warned. They do have some spots that are truly magnifique and some rare animal that is unlikely to see elsewhere.","Written October 14, 2018"

The Great Ape complex is the best I've seen anywhere and the collection successfully exhibits and breeds Gorillas, Orangs, Chimpanzees and Bonobos - something not many zoos can lay claim to. Both indoor and outdoor environments are superbly designed with the animals' needs uppermost. The Gondwanaland exhibit is quite unique but would be better visited during quiet times, that is NOT in school holidays which spoiled the experience for me somewhat. The zoo is also involved in a number of international in situ conservation programmes as well as captive breeding of some vulnerable species.","Written April 4, 2018"

However my wife was keen to visit and it is very accessible being very close to the city centre (within walking distance of the Seaside Park Hotel). It was a revelation, as a layman, all the animals looked in good condition and what I saw of their enclosures appeared very interesting in layout and clean and all the animals looked relatively comfortable and well cared for.
There were large areas of the exhibits that were covered-over (stadium style) so you could wander around and keep relatively dry even on a rainy day as we experienced.
There were adequate toilet and welfare facilities and all were very clean, tidy and well-maintained. Restaurant areas were plentiful with wide and varied offerings. All in all a great place to visit.",

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Hated it,"I see a lot of positive reviews for this zoo and I hate to soil the party but I did not enjoy it at all.

It is expensive and the staff are not very friendly.

It is old-fashioned, and although I liked some of the quaint architectural details, I don't think the animals are well kept or in some cases happy. The fishing cat in particular was pacing obsessively, a sign of trauma. It needs a larger enclosure or to be moved to a better zoo. In general large carnivores need a lot more space than they have here.

The worst was the boat ride; it looks like somebody went to Disney and saw the idea of charging extra to sit in a pretend boat which then carries you down a pretend river. Disney does it a lot better and this was embarrassingly lame. There was almost nothing to see. Mainly a lot of old-fashioned screens.

Massive tropical greenhouse was very impressive but too little (no?) info on plants and birds there.
Really annoying is people smoking everywhere. Apart from smoke it was so crowded people were bumping into lit cigarettes and littering. Really should set aside smoking areas away fromm main areas and phase it out completely.","Written July 1, 2017"

The only downfall is that everywhere within the zoo, the food and drink prices are extortionate. On a very very hot day of 32 degrees, we were forced to pay 3 euros for a small bottle of water. This was my only complaint.

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,A great day out - but just too much to see in a day!!,"We spent a whole day out yesterday at the Leipzig Zoo. It opens at 9am but we are not such early birds on a day off and arrived around 10.30am, eventually leaving around 5.15pm - so a big day out!

The entrance ticket isn't cheap (‚Ç¨21 per adult) so as a short term visitor we definitely felt like we wanted to squeeze as much as possible out of the day... But I think, to our detriment, perhaps we overdid it a bit initially and I ran out of stamina!

There are lots of advertised 'feeding times' for different groups of animals. We would definitely recommend trying to see as many of those as possible as the animals are definitely at their most lively at those points or even just after. The problem with that approach is that the site is so vast and the feeding times so frequent that it's impossible to see as many times as you'd like whilst also getting a good look at the exhibits in between. Perhaps if we were there from doors opening until the very end of the day, but that would have been 9 hours trekking around(!)

There was lots of little cafes, restaurants and snack places where we could have stopped and quite a few benches and seats where people were eating their picnics. (We munched on the hoof, as it were...)

I'd say that if you're a local, getting a year ticket would be the best thing to do. There's so much to see and you could come back again and again!! But as a visitor you don't have that option so we probably only got a really good look at 1/2 to max 2/3 of the creatures - and I felt pretty rushed at that!!

In the last area (Gondwana Land??) we took the boat trip in the hope of seeing some creatures without needing to do the big walk. It was good to have a sit down and nice and cool in the tunnel at the start of the ride, but otherwise it was disappointing for us - we hardly saw any creatures from the boat. Thankfully it wasn't that expensive (‚Ç¨1.50 each) and they were able to play the audio commentary in English for my husband, who has no German.

A particular highlight for us was seeing the pangolins. They are down in the basement of the elephant house. They are a totally unique creature and, in the wild, only live in Taiwan. They were amazing and so interesting - I won't even try and describe them!!","Written June 8, 2017"

We're from the States (whose playgrounds do not even compare to those in Europe), but live in and travel around Europe, so we've seen some good and great playgrounds. This one tops them all by a large margin. It has amazing, overhead, encased climbing tunnels leading to these amazing dragon (and other creature) climbing apparatuses - you have to see it to believe it!
I HIGHLY recommend a visit to this zoo if you visit Leipzig and have ""playground-age"" children.
They could spend HOURS in this playground. Oh, and there is a nice cafe right next to it, so parents can sit, eat, get coffee (and I think they sell beer). NO KIDDING: this playground is worth the price of admission to the zoo!

The zoo is quite large and I would advise using the map to ensure you don't miss anything. It is very hot and cold going in and out of buildings so be prepared to take coats off and on a lot.
There are lots of animals to see and their habitats are generally well laid out with foliage and stuff to play with. Personally I thought some could be bigger. I would advise going slightly earlier or later to avoid the peak times as it can get very busy with people stopping in viewing areas. The ticket seller spoke English. There are plenty of cafes and places to sit in the zoo with toilets available. It also seemed very clean. There was a large gift shop at the exit as well.

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Gondwanaland was excellent.,"We visited as a large party (around 15 of us, with 3 children under 11) in December.
The highlight of the visit was Gondwanaland, a large indoor part of the zoo. You can take a short boat trip around the inside, it costs an extra ‚Ç¨1.50 and it was okay, good for historical facts of the beginning of the world.
I would recommend putting warm clothing (coats etc) into the lockers provided as it gets very warm inside! The lockers need a ‚Ç¨1 coin, but you get the Euro back.

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,,"We visited as a large party (around 15 of us, with 3 children under 11) in December.
The highlight of the visit was Gondwanaland, a large indoor part of the zoo. You can take a short boat trip around the inside, it costs an extra ‚Ç¨1.50 and it was okay, good for historical facts of the beginning of the world.
I would recommend putting warm clothing (coats etc) into the lockers provided as it gets very warm inside! The lockers need a ‚Ç¨1 coin, but you get the Euro back.

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,World Class Zoo,"Easily spent a full day from opening to closing here. The collections are quite extensive and the zoo is in the middle of an extensive renewal program, changing old style barred and bricked enclosures for ones that provide more natural habitats for the animals and which allow visitors a number of different vantage points. The renovated exhibits, especially for the apes and African savanna animals are now large and heavily vegetated.

Their newest and most popular exhibit is Gondwanaland which is a tropical exhibit under a giant climate controlled dome that features a 13-minute educational boat ride, much like a theme park ride with a mixture of light, sound, audio visuals, live action, live plants and animals, accompanied by a narrative. It was very impressive. The rest of the exhibit has a selection of plants, animals and birds from the continents that made up Gondwanaland arranged along a set route that takes you up and down though out the exhibit ‚Äì which ever gives the best view of the animals on display. It took us over two hours to see this exhibit; it‚Äôs very impressive.

One of the aviaries containing a flock of over a hundred American and Chilean flamingos is also huge ‚Äì large enough to allow the flamingos to fly around, and we spent some time just sitting, fascinated, watching their behaviour.",

And animals, of course. There's also a really nice cafe/restaurant/bar there.

The fish feeding is not that spectacular. Make sure you visit Gondwanaland, we did this at the end and even though we were hungry we enjoyed that artificial mosquito-free jungle.

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,A great day in the park,"I am zoology post graduate from Australia and we have plenty of unique fun to enjoy at home but I always visit the zoological gardens of major cities around the world because it's a great day out walking through plotted gardens viewing the exotic animals.

I was taken to Leipzig by my fianc√© and her family and I must admit that this zoo he never been on my radar unlike London San Diego Singapore etc.

The Leipzig zoo has a serious experience to offer you

1/ there is a massive environmentally controlled enclosure called Gondwanaland which is not only a more intimate way to see New world monkeys etc but the flora and waterways are amazing

2/ the Safari Savannah display is vast and a wide variety of plains type mammals and birds share it seamlessly.

3/ primate enclosures are highly and cleverly engineered with wide, open and high spaces for the various troops to live almost naturally

4/ the aquarium is impressive with its circular design allowing fish to almost race around you and eachother.

5/ and the highlight for me ........ BIG Tigers.
If you've only ever seen smaller tigers you just have to see these ones ... They are HUGE. Breathtaking!!!!

Ok the only other thing you really need to know is that the coffee is bad everywhere

I left the zoo highly impressed with the technical aspects of the animal husbandry and public display and felt proud of the Leipzig Zoo as an example of how to bring wildlife close to people and give them an appreciation of nature.

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Not worth visiting,"After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor we felt it was a 'must visit'. However we found the animal enclosures dated, too small, overgrown and not a pleasant environment for the animals. Especially shocking was the elephant enclosure with one elephant rocking as if it was totally stressed out or thoroughly bored. Some of the birds had very little area to fly, and most of the animal enclosures seemed empty as we failed miserably to find the listed animals. We would definitely say we had wasted the 37 euros we paid, done waste your money.","Written July 26, 2016"

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Initial Appearance Good,"The zoo car park was modern and well designed. We thought this theme would continue through into the Zoo. The entrance to the zoo was impressive and the day started well. The entrance fee was more than fair Euro 18.50 per adult. We headed for the Savannah to enjoy our breakfast on the balcony overlooking the giraffes, zebra, gazelles. Great experience.

Sadly, the zoo generally was unkempt . Although the theme was to be similar to a safari experience the areas around the fenced off areas looked neglected rather than naturally wild. The sea lions and penguin water areas were slimy green making it difficult to see them swim. This generally applied to most of the water areas and ponds. The grotto where the nocturnal animals are housed is very dark and unpleasant.

They are in the process of investing a lot to improve the Zoo. I hope that Disney won't influence the end result too much.

Still worth a trip if only for the breakfast overlooking the Savannah.","Written June 19, 2016"

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Have to visit in Leipzig!,"The Leipzig Zoo is one of the spot you have to visit, when you are in the area!
You can spend half a day in Godwana Land alone. The African area, where zebras, giraffes and ostriches run free is impressing. You really can get the idea of a stampede in steppe. One of the highlights is the lion, he reminds me of Alex the Lion from Madagascar. He sure knows how to pose!
The area of the primates is impressive too, although it gave me the creeps watching the chimpanzees.
The walkways, the surrounding, plants, buildings, everything is harmonious.
We have been there on a weekday (Wednesday in may), no holiday season.
A parking deck is available, but it‚Äôs better to by tramway line 20 or 24 from main station (Hauptbahnhof) to direction Gohlls-Nord, it‚Äôs just 3 Stations, so, even in walking distance from city centre. And the tram stop is directly in front of the zoo entrance.

Pongoland was undoubtedly the best great ape enclosures we've ever seen and Gondwanaland was just out of this world, so so impressive.

The only thing we didn't like was the snow leopard enclosures. We were so surprised to see them in such a cramped space after being so impressed with everything else but then saw the large area currently being constructed for them so obviously just temporary.

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Year-round treat,"Many zoos are unimpressive in the winter months, with animals resting in warmer enclosures rather than out in the cold. Leipzig Zoo is open year-round and has separate prices for the winter months so you still feel like you're getting a good deal.

The animals are all in decently sized enclosures, and there is more than enough there for an entire day's visit. If you go in the colder months, look out for Gondwanaland, and prepare to take off the thick coats and scarves, and get up-close and personal with some rather cheeky animals.","Written February 22, 2016"

It's the first time ever I've stayed at a zoo from open till close........even the ""renowned"" San Diego zoo couldn't keep me for more than a few hours.

The layout of this zoo is brilliant. I was impressed by the size of the place, the number of animals, how good their enclosures were and in general how much space they had. The Gondwana land exhibit is exceptional (and in the middle of the January freeze a welcome relief.........even stripped down to just t-shirt (oh and pants of course)). I was disappointed when I saw the outdoor primate exhibits empty only to have that turn to astonishment when I found their winter quarters which they were absolutely loving. Think I spent just an hour in there alone (and is another area of reprieve from the cold). The resident cat in the indoor viewing area was pretty special too lol.

Price wise I think I only paid $16 Euros which is fantastic for everything that was there. Great range of souvenirs too which were actually (I thought) reasonably priced.",

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,More humans than animals,"Visited on a fine September Saturday afternoon and the zoo was inevitably very crowded. Most of the animals were wisely asleep. But good sightings of local people -- I assume they were mostly local as NB the museum *does not accept foreign credit cards* for its expensive entrance fees. No map was provided with the ticket, though some maps were on display in central areas. Felt shunted around in a bossy way, and confronted with endless food and drink stops, shops, etc. The monkey house (Pongoland?), which I remembered as stunning from last time, was particularly disappointing. Under 10 monkeys/orang utans were visible, rather than a entire community reacting off each other. If you like crowds of humans and a few sleeping animals, this is for you. However, on the plus side, the zoo seems very committed to educating its visitors about the animals and their care and chances of survival.","Written September 13, 2015"

Its a modern zoo with lots of open space for the animals to live a close to natural life, without cages.
Many aquatic species are displayed artfully behind glass so that one can see them both above and below water.
The tropical area is best viewed first before the crowds build up and it is, of course, very hot and humid inside and even has a boat ride.
The great apes and great cats are displayed on naturalistic islands and all look content and unaffected by the small crowds of onlookers.
This zoo does seem to champion the lesser known animals too so expect to see some weird rodents and even a Pangolin.

Most of the compounds are huge and very diverse in landscaping (e.g. the islands, rivers and trees of the great apes or the large savanna compound).
For me especially the apes and the behavioral studies the conduct on them there were the most interesting as you seldomly get all the great apes together in one place (orang-utans, chimpanzees, gorillas and bonobos).
The rainforest globe was wunderful too (though the boat-tour was a little bit too ""Disney"" for me).

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,A great Zoo,"A large, very good and well-maintained Zoo. All the usual animals but some were not to be seen - perhaps as it was a cold wet day. Of particular note is the Jungle Dome which is like a much larger Eden Project only with animals! Also a very good Aquarium. The only small downside is that refreshments seemed overpriced compared with restaurants/cafes in Leipzig but then the cost of entry is very reasonable.","Written April 4, 2015"
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,"Great visit, highly recommend","One of the best zoo's I have visited. Albeit off season, but you can see that they are preparing for summer with re-planting and constructions. With the construction going on some areas were off limits but it doesn' spoil the day. The whole place is very well laid out and sign posted. The dome i was most impressed with, it is however hot and humid in there so be aware if you don't like that. There is a boat ride around the dome, the animals are free to roam, there are lovely colourful birds flying around and you can do a tree top walk. There is also a gift and food shop\bar. The rest of the animals had large enclosures and looked pretty happy. The only disappointing thing was the elephants didn't look happy or look like they had enough room, but there is construction next to them so I hope it is an add on for them. The one lion we saw also look lonely but did have a large space. The zoo overall was a good experience and would recommend it and wearing flat shoes for the walk.",
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Fun on a sunny morning,"Easy to walk to from my hotel, and well laid out with plenty of signs. A variety of animal 'kingdoms' to visit, but actually not all that many animals when I was there - were they all indoors for the winter? Fairly natural surroundings for the animals, just a bit dated. A good value buffet lunch in the savannah section.","Written March 16, 2015"
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Very Good but huge amount of building work in progress,"Stuck in Leipzig for the weekend and as a keen animal lover I decided to visit the Zoo. Overall the experience was good but with a few minor disappointments. Large areas of the park presently have construction work and areas are closed off and, on the day I visited it would seem the big cats were people/camera shy and didnt want to be viewed.
The indoor dome area is excellent but be prepared its very hot and humid and you will sweat. Clearly there is a very successful breeding program with a number of animals with young. On the Sunday I visited it was very very busy I think in part to the fact it was a very nice day and I queued for quite sometime for entrance only to discover I could have got in much quicker with some local knowledge. TIP FOR VISITORS: Dont queue for the Left hand kiosk go to the right, walk past the line further inside and you will find 6 more kiosks where to pay with small queues. I would also suggest you wear very comfortable shoes as you will walk much further than anticipated if you see everything.","Written March 8, 2015"

The zoo houses a lot of rare and endangered species. There are also restaurants and cafes distributed conveniently in each section of the park. I can firmly say that our visit was worth the time!",

The zoo in Leipzig is a wonder-world with so many fantastic houses, gardens, facilities for a huge amount of animals all over the planet. Already the entrance is often shown on TV, the gardens are in great shape, the housing-facilities are very modern, even humidified, artificial jungle-athmospheres are in there with original plants, stones and all kinds of jungle animals in the air, on the plants and in the water.

First of all, we didn't realize how big it was. There was some construction going on by the entrance, so my first impression wasn't so good. But once we discovered the tropical parts of the zoo and the number of animals you can see in one place, we were speechless.

I've been to open a safari park in England, and the gorgeous zoo in Sydney, Australia; but neither of them can race with Leipzig zoo.

The amount of different plants, the variety of animals, the number of cafes across the zoo was mesmerizing.

If you ever go there, leave enough time to do the mini boat trip in the last and the largest tropical area of the zoo. It's beautiful.

It was also unique to examine tropical plants and animal without being hassled by mosquitoes or other bugs! Leipzig Zoo is a genuinely unique place.","Written January 28, 2015"

Germany,Schnoor Viertel,Best Place to start your Bremen tour/visit!,"My wife and myself arrived in Bremerhaven yesterday morning aboard the Azamara Journey Cruise Ship and - together with some fellow passengers - spent the afternoon on a Walking Tour of nearby (55 kms away) Bremen.

In this regard, we were fortunate to have an excellent guide who suggested that the tour should start in the Schnoor District - Bremen‚Äôs oldest quarter less than 5 minutes walk from the main square.

This proved a good move setting the scene nicely for the rest of the tour which tool in the cathedral, City Hall and the riverside area. Schnoor is not huge but it is packed with history - meandering streets with half-timbered houses, many of which are now restaurants or shops.

All visitors are, therefore, strongly recommended to spend their first 30 minutes or so in the delightful Schnoor District.","Written September 5, 2018"

By the 1950s all rest of the building were in extremely bad shape, then the city decided to rebuild and restore this area. In 1973 it was designated a historic area. We enjoyed walking through this area, but the enjoyment was hampered by way too many tourists for these narrow streets to handle. On top of that there are tour groups in numbers up to 50 people each crowded together with a leader holding a flag or sign up high and speaking loudly. It is bad and a poorer experience because of this. I would recommend visiting here early in the morning and certainly before 10 am. After that it is too crazy.",

Germany,Schnoor Viertel,Winds its way into your heart,"We entered the Schnoor from the Marktplatz (after admiring the statue of Roland, the Rathaus (Town Hall), the statue that marks the place of the pre-Inquisition bath house -- fun and naughty, and the Dom (the Cathedral), and rubbing the nose of the donkey (the Musicians of Bremen statue) on a cold January evening. The Schnoor -- which means ""the Rope"" in German) -- is aptly named. Its accepted meaning derives from the houses strung together like beads on a string and, alternatively, the ropemakers' quarter. I missed the rest of the branches of the maze, so tell of what I saw.

The narrow, winding alley goes through the oldest part of Bremen where narrow half-timbered houses jostle and lean over you, spilling over with tiny shops stuffed with souvenirs, sweets -- where they were pulling taffy as we watched), ribbons and buttons, and Christmas decorations (it's open all year), handicrafts and herb teas and soaps, and more. We stopped at a kiosk selling gluhwein, and in the doorway across the lane (that is, six feet away) stood a man in medieval costume, holding a dead rat (okay, a very good imitation of one). Clearly advertising a performance within, but alas, we had not the time to stop and see. Of the several cafes, we visited one (the name of which escapes me, but is a huge, high-ceilinged place, very 1920s, the walls crammed with photographs of the dignitaries and celebrities who have all stopped by for a drink).

In places, the Schnoor is so narrow that you could touch the walls on both sides when you stretch your arms. A cluster of potted plants in a corner at one of the many bends of this crooked alley, curtains in the upstairs windows show that some lucky people live in this delightful piece of Bremen. One can go on to the Boetscherstrasse and the Paula Modersohn-Becker Museum (we could not, as it was too late, so consoled ourselves with shopping at the souvenir shop).

Of course, we walked around the outside and heard about the history of the castle.
It is a beautiful spot and while much in ruins has interesting parts still to see.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Heidelberg‚Äôs must see,"This is the must-see place in Heidelberg. Expect to spend around 1-2 hours at the castle.

I‚Äôd recommend paying for the Bergbahn to get from the street level to the castle. Your ticket for that includes your entrance fee to the schloss. If you don‚Äôt want to pay to go into the schloss, you can wander the gardens and get some excellent views of the city below.

I‚Äôd also recommend purchasing an audio guide for a slight additional fee. Greatly enhances the visit and gives insight into construction, history, and art surrounding the castle.","Written November 10, 2021"

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Interesting castle with beautiful and varied view,"Nice walk upwards, the castle was built over a 200 year period, was destroyed and re-constructed in several spots, and is surrounded by a large park with modern statues. Because of covid 19, the guided tour of the interiors could not take place as usual, but the guide took us to exterior terraces, the main hall and chapel that are not normally accessible.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Varied visit,"Schloss Heidelberg is located on a hill, overlooking the river and part of the town. We drove up by car and parked near by. From the parking lot takes about 10/15 minutes. You'll pass through lovely gardens and are rewarded with gorgeous views. There is also a cable car, of which the fee is included in the castle entry ticket. Personally I don't know where the start and exit are located.

Entry tickets are 8 euros for adults and 4 for kids. When we were there, we were a bit confused though, because there were also signs saying that you could visit parts for free. Not sure about that... We just bought a ticket anyway.

The visit is varied. You'll be able to visit the courtyard, the big wine barrel, the apothecary museum, and two large balconies/gardens looking out over the town and river. I especially liked the museum, it was very informative and there were a lot of objects. There was loads to see. I especially liked the set ups of life-like apothecary shops.

We spend around 1,5 hours at seeing the things mentioned above. If you wish, you can also go on a tour of the inside of the castle. For this, you have to purchase an extra ticket. Part of the castle is in ruins, but the main body is still in use.

If you're in the area, it is definitely worth a visit, mostly because of the museum. Strictly looking at the architecture (on the outside), I didn't think it was the most beautiful castle that south-Germany has to offer though. So it really depends on what you're looking for!","Written August 18, 2020"

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Amazing,The castle and surrounding grounds were amazing. Parts of the castle were closed due to COVID but well worth the visit. The town is so nice and inviting as well. Highly recommend it.,
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Certainly the highlight of Heidelberg and the dominant building of the old town,"Heidelberg Castle, even if partially a ruin, is the symbol of the city of Heidelberg. It stands imposingly slightly elevated and also offers a great view from the ""Old Bridge"" or the ""Philosopher's Walk"".
Heidelberg's trademark, the red sandstone - for sure, nice to look at!
Historically and visually interesting, even if today's view has nothing in common with the castle, which has been mentioned since the 12th century.

The castle can be reached either on foot, although the 80 meters in altitude from Necker / Altstadt become a bit tiring over time. Alternatively, you can take the historic cable car up from the Kornmarkt, or take the bus (line 20 / M5).

The castle from the outside with its gardens, the thick tower, or the Friedrichsbau is a worthwhile sight. Plus a good view of the old town.
It is worthwhile both during the day and in the evening when the spotlights hit the building.
You can take a tour of the castle, you don't have to. The ""big barrel"" is definitely a nice sight and a great photo opportunity. In return, I was disappointed with the pharmacy museum.

My conclusion: the castle is a must! Very nice during the day and in the evening / at night - also look at it from afar. The tour can be taken if there is enough time, it does not necessarily have to be.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Enjoy the view...,"Schloss Heidelberg is the main attraction of the city,and very well known,at least in Europe.It's very nice to look at it from Alte Br√ºcke,but it's worth visiting.We took the funicular 'cause entrance is close to the Marktplatz and easy to find and it was too hot to climb up.Castle is old,huge and impressive.It's ruined pretty much,but there are interesting things to see,including the biggest wine barrel in the world.Of course,the best of all is the view from the castle.I really enjoyed it.You can see old town and old bridge on the beautiful Neckar river.If I was a poet and if my English was better,I would describe it to you,but it's not the case.So,you have to believe me that the view is awsome,or even better,go and see for yourself.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Schloss at the Top,"One of the easiest and comfortable DIY Tours in Europe that we experienced was the tour of the Schloss Castle in Heidelberg. The self tour started at the square or the Altstadt then we took a short walk to the Funicular Station or the Lift Heidelberg Castle where we took a ride up to the Schloss Castle. It was fun for the family touring around a centuries old medieval structure. And yes, there is food and that was a big plus to kids.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Lots of tips and a warning,"First tip, park at Parkhaus Kornmarkt/Schloss. This garage is near to everything. From this parking garage you have a choice to go West into town, or walk up ""Kurzer Buckel,"" this is a paved pathway with lots of stairs straight up to Schloss/Heidelberg Castle. Be in shape, or take your time! There is a ""Mountain Cable Car Lift"" to the top, we didn't take that, but I'd highly recommend this for people who are out of shape. I bought the tour guide and entrance into the castle, it was pricey. Close to 80 ‚Ç¨ for nine of us. Just get the audio guide. I am not at all exaggerating when I tell you our guide ruined the castle for us. He was sarcastic, caustic and made fun of us tourists to pay to see a castle ruin that had nothing at all left worth seeing. Heidelberg, in general, is a lot like Kaiserslautern. I did not expect to see the flood of tourists overrunning these smaller towns. You will hear English being spoken everywhere.",

I definitely recommend purchasing the guided tour. We took an English tour and our guide was very knowledgable and provided great insights into the history of the castle. It was a small tour and we were able to ask questions easily. Many of the interior rooms have been completely restored and provide a beautiful glimpse into times gone by.

After the tour we checked out the permanent exhibition of pharmacy on site and the famous giant wine barrel. The views of Heidelberg from the gardens were gorgeous. I also liked that the plaques were not only in German but also English so it was very easy as a tourist to gather information. We could have got the return train down but happily walked 10 mins.

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Great view,"Schloss Heidelberg (Heidelberg Castle) is for such reason a more busy place than even the notorious Neuschwanstein Castle. A very large red sandstone building complex, the castle sits nicely overlooking the Neckar river, thus providing a spectacular view of the old town, the river and the plains.

You can easily access the castle via a historical Zahnradbahn (cog railway) running in a tunnel system. Must sees are the Big Barrel which is as big as a small house, a great piece of craftsmanship. Also free with the combined access and cog railway ticket is the pharmacy museum which is actually much more interesting than it would seem at first site: It is a testimony to the very recent ultra-fast development of the pharmaceutical industry.

In order to access the inside of the castle you have to join a group and make sure you order a ticket before you enter the castle grounds proper. But be sure to mind the stairs, there are a lot.

Altogether a nice experience despite the more than usual huge crowd.

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Interesting castle with great views,"I found the castle interesting from a historical perspective with the links to the British Royal Family. We had an excellent guide who certainly knew the history. The castle itself is largely ruins and the only part we could go inside was a vault containing the world‚Äôs largest wine barrel.

We went up to the castle by coach, the road is very twisty and parking is a bit of a nightmare. I think there is a funicular or I suppose you could walk but that road is very steep.

It does get very crowded with lots of tour groups at the same time. The vault in particular gets crowded.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Castle Highlights & Ticket Tips,"We had a fabulous day trip to Heidelberg and the castle was definitely the ‚Äòdon‚Äôt miss‚Äô part of the trip.

CASTLE HIGHLIGHTS:
i) Getting off the funicular, the first part you see is the most ruined part. Head through the romantic gateway, ‚ÄòElisabethentor‚Äô. Freidrich V had it built as a birthday surprise for his wife, Elizabeth Stuart (daughter of James 1, king of England & Scotland). The biggest surprise is that he had it built in just one night.
ii) Look out for the tall round tower on your right. The toilet is built off to the side and opened onto the ground below (see photo). Apparently this was absolutely acceptable in those days and the ‚Äòcontents‚Äô fell down as fertiliser on the gardens underneath. It has to be said that the lawn below is very green.
iii) The path leads you around to Dicker Turm (the fat tower). Views from here are absolutely stunning. We stood here for ages just looking out across the town and river.
iv) The next section is through the courtyard and drawbridge (keep your ticket handy as you have to show it again here). Pass through the portcullis and under some pretty fearsome spikes. The courtyard area is much more intact and the huge pink stone walls of the 17th century residential palace are impressive.
v) Look out for a rare example of a vertical sun dial, with Roman numerals for the hours and astrological signs to show the time of year. It‚Äôs easily overlooked because it is high up on one of the walls.
vi) The Tun (world‚Äôs biggest wine keg) is down the ramp on your left. Entry is free with your castle ticket. It‚Äôs a bit of fun and a novelty to climb the stairs on to the top of it.
vii) Don't miss the Apothecary Museum. It might not sound like the most interesting museum in the world but it was fascinating & beautiful. I‚Äôm so pleased we didn't overlook it. It‚Äôs only small so a visit can be quite quick.
viii) There are more marvellous views again if you walk out past the museum. If you want to walk back down to town, the exit is here too or you can continue onto the castle‚Äôs terraced gardens. We skipped the gardens but only because we wanted to have time for the Philosopher‚Äôs Walk. We also decided to walk back down from this point, rather than wait for the funicular again. It was a quick and easy walk downhill.

TICKETS:
The castle, the barrel, the museum and the funicular are all included in your castle ticket (‚Ç¨8). You can be asked to show the ticket a number of times so its good to keep it handy. We didn't hire the audio guide. Information throughout the castle is good and signs are in English and German. Guided tours are extra but they can take you inside the castle. We didn't do the tour because the English tours are not that frequent. We found that there was plenty to see without doing the tour.

GETTING THERE:
The funicular is the quickest and easiest way up, especially as it‚Äôs included in your ticket. If the line is very long, you can walk. It‚Äôs a short walk (about 15 min) but very steep. You‚Äôll find the funicular and the ticket office behind Kornmarkt square. Look for the big pinkish coloured building with the sign ‚ÄòBergbahnen Heidelberg‚Äô. Enter through the doors under the sign ‚ÄòStation Kornmarkt‚Äô. We got there around midday and at that time we waited for about 30-40 minutes. A couple of hours later the line was much longer and was out the door and around the corner so I‚Äôd definitely recommend going earlier in the day if possible.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,The Schloss is well worth a visit-lovely.,"This is a beautiful, majestic castle, overlooking the city of Heidelberg. It is especially beautiful in the winter when it is snow covered. The old pharmacy of the castle is still there as a museum and is also worth a visit.","Written November 6, 2019"
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Romantic and Beautiful,I was stationed nearby some 25 or more years ago and the place really hasn't changed. Our children are now grown and my wife with her first time in Germany thoroughly enjoyed this scenic place. It inspires you to hold hands and take in all of the views. When you walk around the grounds and in and amongst the ruins you feel as though you were living in the 15th century. We would recommend spending several days here and in the city of Heidelberg.,
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Click worthy,"Saw this palace from our cruise on the Rhein river. It‚Äôs at a height above a cliff and quite spread across, although seemed very old and unpreserved.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,"Beautiful castle, but only outside","Poor tourist trap! The castle itself is beautiful, worth the visit and the walk around it, but not in the inside. Do not buy entrance!!
It takes not long to go up by feet. It's a little challenging if you are not fit but you can make several breaks (and trust me, rather this than standing hours in queue for the train, and paying..).

We were extremely disappointed paying 8 Euro each and then literally was nothing inside. Not even a nicer photo spot or historical exhibition. You can see no interiors, just a big barrel, an Apotheke museum (if you are interested, it's nice I guess) and the main point: restaurant and bar. Where tourists can pay more money.

So basically you pay an entrance fee for the opportunity to lay out additional money for expensive drinking and eating!

That's just a shame. You can just learn some history if you pay extra for a guided tour, which ofc is not mentioned at the ticket office (honestly I wouldn't even bother with this bc I'm pissed).

They should go to the Netherlands and learn how they manage the castles there!

And be prepared for the crowd of tourists!","Written November 3, 2019"
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,"Great Views, lots of people and mind the stairs","Schloss Heidelberg (Heidelberg Castle) is for such reason a more busy place than even the notorious Neuschwanstein Castle. A very large red sandstone building complex, the castle sits nicely overlooking the Neckar river, thus providing a spectacular view of the old town, the river and the plains.

You can easily access the castle via a historical Zahnradbahn (cog railway) running in a tunnel system. Must sees are the Big Barrel which is as big as a small house, a great piece of craftsmanship. Also free with the combined access and cog railway ticket is the pharmacy museum which is actually much more interesting than it would seem at first site: It is a testimony to the very recent ultra-fast development of the pharmaceutical industry.

In order to access the inside of the castle you have to join a group and make sure you order a ticket before you enter the castle grounds proper. But be sure to mind the stairs, there are a lot.

Altogether a nice experience despite the more than usual huge crowd.

Enjoy","Written November 1, 2019"

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Really fun to see,"We were on our way to France and made a very last-minute decision (as in, nearly missed the exit) to stop in Heidelberg and see the castle. It was quite a bit out of our way, but we didn't regret it the least!

The view from the castle are absolutely beautiful, and the castle itself is outrageously interesting to look at. I wouldn't say it's a destination trip, but we stayed for about 1 or 1.5 hours and really enjoyed it.

WARNING: figuring out where to turn for castle parking on the steep, windy roads with poor visibility around corners and no clear signage was a horrible nightmare. There was even some road construction happening up there, which did not help. Please be prepared for how stressful that is.","Written October 28, 2019"

The Schloss is in a challenging location, as regards narrow winding uphill roads. I marveled at the skills of the bus drivers as we ascended the hillside.

Overlooking the town and river, this magnificent place is carved with amazing sculpture. Loved it from the time we entered the gates to the castle.

The best to do is buy the ticket that includes the entry to castle and also train ticket and the ticket to visit the top of the mountain to see the view of the city. This is going to be hassle free. The castle do have different sections which enlighten people on different generations of Pharmacy/medicinal research Germany has done right from Asprin to other innovations.

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Renaissance marvel atop the hill,"Heidelberg Castle, without a doubt, is the most famous landmark of the city. It represents one of the most important Renaissance structures north of the Alps.
It is located on the Schlossberg (Castle Hill), just above the Old Town and dates back to early XIII century.
First mention of the single castle on the hill was in 1214 and after 1294, when was the last time that the single castle was mentioned, there were two castles, lower and upper, which can be proofed by the document from 1303 in which is stated that there were lower castle, the site of today's Schloss Heidelberg on Jettenb√ºhl or Schlossberg and upper castle on Kleiner Gaisberg Mountain, near today's Hotel Molkenkur.
After 1294, there were two castles, lower - at the place of today‚Äôs site of Schloss Heidelberg at Schlossberg (Jettenb√ºhl) and upper - on Kleiner Gaisberg Mountain, near today‚Äôs hotel Hotel Molkenkur.
The first documented mention of this claim was in 1303.
The present structure had been expended by 1650, before the damage by later wars and fires. Maybe, the worst destruction of the castle was in 1689, when the French troops invaded Heidelberg and after a defeat and withdrawal from the city, they set a massive fire and blew up the front off the Fat Tower.
The castle was residence of many aristocrats from royal family and truly represents historical treasure, not only in Heidelberg itself, but in whole Germany.
Around the castle, there is beautiful garden and in front of the garden, there is Visitor Centre, which was made by famous Swiss architect Max Dudler.
In the castle itself, you can find a museum, German Pharmacy Museum and the most famous beer barrel Gro√ües Fass (Heidelberg Tun) with its magnificent 219.000 litres.
Today, the castle area is flocked by the tourists from many countries around the globe and estimated number of tourists per year is about three million of which the highest number comes from the USA and Japan.
If you are in a good shape, take a walk to the castle, which will take some twenty minutes or 1 steep km.
For the others, there is the famous steep railway, Bergbahn.
Absolutely must see and feel a brief history lesson of the city.",

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,"For the trip up take the stairs and down the tram , the views are stunning and the castle bautiful","We visited in peak season , lots of tourist , but the grounds and large and easy to get around. There is a tram going up and down , but it is worth the punishment to take the 300+ stairs going up and the tram down. The gardens and buildings taking the stairs are worth the effort. Get there early as the tours into the castle closes at 16h00 and you can still walk around the castle grounds and enter the big wine barrel , you cannot enter the castle. It really is beautiful with stunning views from the top",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,"Lovely grounds, interesting castle","We should have given ourselves more time. I've heard the gardens are fabulous, but we weren't able to go see them. The world's largest wine cask is worth a photo op, and it's great that they offer tours of the castle in English. There is a fascinating exhibit of the history of German apothecaries. The tram ride up to the castle is included in the price of admission. We didn't know that, so we climbed the equivalent of 17 flights of stairs. Good workout.

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,"Beautiful view, interesting ruin",The castle was destroyed by a fire and never rebuilt. What you see are the ruins. It also offers a beautiful view of the city.,
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Wow!,"This is a huge castle on top of the mountain and it overlooks beautiful Heidelberg, consequently, you can see the castle from many places in the town. It is beautiful to look at fromt he town and equally as beautiful to see the town from the castle grounds.

You can walk up (& down) or take a cable car. We took the cable car up, but walked down and it is a quiet little walk back to the town.

The castle is on beautiful grounds and there is a lot to see. Don't forget to check out the winery and the 2 large wine vats. The first one you see is huge, but wait... you see one even bigger with a dance floor on top. You can walk up there and dance too. It's not a big dance floor, but still impressive.

One of the cook things (we thought) was the sundial type clock on the side of the building (I will add a photo). It was not expensive and it was well worth seeing. You can do the simple tour or go more in depth and see more.

WHen you get done, go to the old bridge and look back up at the castle. Enjoy. It is must when in Heidelberg",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Beautiful palace & grounds,"Unfortunately we only had limited time to explore the palace and its grounds, because of the structure of a tour.

As I was hungry and tired I said what they had given me was fine - and indeed it was very nice. But then when the bill came, the meal I recieved was more expensive than what I ordered - again the restaurant asked me what were we going to do about it, putting the onus on me !! Come on guys, it was your mistake so just cover the extra 4 euros !! As it was, I was on a short break and didn't want to start having an argument over 4 euros so paid the difference.

The history behind the castle is every bit as interesting as the castle structure itself. Just please note a couple of things. First, this is actually a castle ruin, so other than the wine cellar, all toured areas of the castle are exterior areas. Second, the crowds can be very overwhelming and uncomfortable, so try and visit during off peak times if at all possible.","Written July 1, 2019"
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Don‚Äôt miss the castle!!,"This was our first time visiting Heidelberg Castle. We primarily did it as we had family visiting from the states. The first big challenge: finding parking! Most of the nearby parking garages were already full by noon, so recommend you go early. We ended up having to drive all the way up above the castle on a VERY tight road. But, once we found a spot, we really enjoyed this historic castle. Our daughter and her friends took the English speaking guided tour and the rest of us took a self guided tour. Clearly, as is always the case, the rest of us should have taken the guided tour. The girls said their guide (Mr. Cooper?) did an outstanding job giving them the history of the castle and surrounding area. Both the inside and outside of the castle are really unique, with some spectacular views.

The structure itself gives a look into life as it once was. Still in pretty good condition. You can take a funicular (train) to the entrance, or take a pretty strenuous walk. The line for the train was long, so we elected to walk. It was warm, but the pathway is fairly shaded, so it wasn't bad, but we did take the train down.","Written June 27, 2019"

For those with pram, do note that for some strange reasons, you would have to carry the pram and walk up the stairs. However for those on wheelchair, there is a short lift to move you from the ground floor to the platform for you to take the furnicular.

Overall the castle (aka Schloss) was enjoyable and we had bright sunny weather when we visited in mid June. Do check out the (free!) pharmacy museum too beside the castle compound.","Written June 26, 2019"
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Heidelberg Castle,The guided tour of the castle done by a local guide was excellent. She was very knowledgeable about the castle history and about the city of Heidelberg.

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Don't miss this Heidelberg gem!,"Don't miss this if your in Heidelberg! I was actually surprised at the ornate detail on the castle facade and the grounds were beautiful to walk around. It's the same price whether you walk up or get the funicular (It's included in the entry price anyway). If its a clear day, its also worth paying for the second cable car to Konigstuhl, the view is great.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Visited the castle on a river cruise excursion,"On our excursion with Scenic river cruises, our bus drove to the new visitor's center on the castle grounds. After a WC (free) break, our guide escorted us to the ornate red clay arch that Fredrick V had built in 1615 for his new wife to impress her with the sight of her new palace. This archway framed the English wing he had built just for her - just ruins now. We also got a closeup view of the towers that the French had exploded in 1689. The next stop was at the Bridge Keeper's House where our guide showed us the ring handle with the ""witches bite"", the drawbridge, and the two types of doors used at this gate in the medieval ages.

After walking through the two gates - Bridge gate and the Clock Tower - we saw the inner courtyard next. This area had about 9 palaces in ruins. Each had been built in a different era and in a style of that era. All builders had belonged to the ruling Wittelsbach family. For example, on the left of the entry gate was the oldest building in the courtyard - Rupertsbau, a ruin that was built in the early 1400s. At the end of the courtyard were the 2 major attractions - the Renaissance buildings of Ottheinrichsbau (an open ruin), built by Elector Otto Heinrich in 1556 and Friedrichsbau (has the twin gables) built by Friedrich IV in early 1600s. The ruin in between these two buildings had Renaissance arches and was once a banqueting hall (1549) during Elector Friedrich II's reign. Because of its glass mirrors it was known as the Hall of Mirrors - Glaserner Saalbau.

The Friedrichsbau was the most interesting to look at. On its 3 storey facade were statues of the Wittelsbach rulers from the 1600s going back as far as Charlemagne. His statue was on the top row, the first one. The last ruler who lived in that palace was Fredrick IV, the builder of the palace and his statue was on the bottom row at the corner. This building has had the least damage from war and fires so its owners have tried to preserve it.

At regular intervals, on the 3 storey facade of the Ottheinrichsbau, statues of Greek gods can be seen. Jupiter is on the roof. Around the ornate entrance door are statues of Moses, David, Joshua, and Hercules. They are symbols for strength. This building has a long staircase leading to the entrance door.

The Great Terrace, located at the back of the Friedrichsbau, was our next stop for terrific views of the old town of Heidelberg, the Alte Brucke, and the Neckar River.

Close to the Great Terrace in the cellar of a tower, our guide showed us the much talked about 8 meter wide wine barrel. It was was a fantastic sight. Imagine the gallons of wine that the Elector's tenants contributed as a form of tax payment. Stairs led to the top of the barrel. In the same cellar room, a cafe offered refreshments like soup 4E, sausages in a bun 4E, applestrudel 4.50E. That was the end of our escorted tour.

In our limited amount of free time, we chose to visit the Pharmacy Museum. Entrance to the German Pharmacy Museum is in the basement of the Ottheinrichsbau, below that exterior ornate door. This museum should not be missed! Its entrance is included in the castle admission ticket. Allow about 30 minutes for a visit as there are a lot of information boards to read. These provide many facts about the use of herbs to cure medieval illnesses. There are at least 3 different rooms set up as pharmacies; each displayed many cabinets and shelves of jars labelled for herbs from A-Z. Samples of these herbs, tools for their preparation, and storage were on display, too. A guided tour is not needed here.

The garden is free with or without a ticket to the inner courtyard. The garden has paths through an English landscape type of garden with mature oaks, cedars, and ginko trees. The fountain is the focal point right at the castle wall. A guided tour is not needed here.

Visitors can purchase an additional ticket for en employee guide tour of the interior of the palaces (5E). For tour times in German and English, visit the Schloss's website. which also gives various admission prices including a senior's discount.

I enjoyed visiting the castle on an escorted tour from our cruise ship. Our guide pointed out details, gave us background information, and told stories about the various things we were seeing. With guided tours of this nature, I find there usually is insufficient time for looking at other things not on the tour. Our excursion allowed just over 1 hour for this visit. I would have been happier with another 30 minutes of free time.","Written June 23, 2019"
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,"Schloss Heidelberg is large, full of history and an outstanding location","We were on a Viking Rhine River Cruise and Heidelberg was one of our guided tours.The castle sits 330 feet above the Neckar River. It was built before 1214, deserted by the French in the 17th century and destroyed by fire as they retreated. Our guide was excellent and knowledgeable about the history of the castle which interesting. I recommend having a guide for the tour.The setting was truly worth the visit. The buildings are majestic and constructed from the rich red sandstone. In the cellar is the largest wine cask in the world and it is the third one to be there. There are cobble stoned walkways so pay attention. I recommend the trip to the castle.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Castle ruins of red Neckar sandstone,"Located 300 ft. up the K√∂nigstuhl hillside, overlooking the old town of Heidelberg and the Neckar River, Heidelberg Castle was a memorable visit.
Two castles were first mentioned in 1303 and over the centuries the structures were destroyed by natural disasters and invading armies and then restored to varying degrees. In 1810 Charles de Graimberg dedicated himself to the preservation of the Castle ruins.
Some of the wonderful architectural elements remaining:
Main gate built in 1528.
Friedrichsbau built 1607, restored in the 19th century, featuring statuary of rulers on its Baroque facade
Otttheinrichsbau, a landmark of German Rennaissance, built in 1559
The Elisabethentor triumphal arch from 1615
Not of architectural significance, but one of the most popular destinations is the Fassbau with a wine barrel able to hold 221,726 litres.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Get there Early!,"The view from Schloss Heidelberg is breathtaking and the visuals of the structures themselves are worth the trip up the hill. The castle is very affordable to see, with a paid tour a must to get a better insight into the building. The pharmacy museum is also certainly worth visiting as is taking the extra ride to the very top of the hill. You need to get up there early but will still have to put up with large tour groups and the inevitable selfies. As they channel all passengers, up and down, through the same line at the castle funicular station when leaving it can be a bit congested. Like many attractions it is spoilt to some degree by commercialisation.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,"Great visit, but take the guided tour","Very interesting place, but the highlight was the guide (Pieter) who brought the history and Castle alive with his stories.

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Outstanding Renaissance Castle,"In my opinion this castle originally built in 1214 is a must see when in Heidelberg. You can access the red sandstone Renaissance style castle by car (limited parking space), walk (260 feet above the town and a steep climb), bike (I hope you are in great shape) or funicular which I recommend, For 8 euros (adult ticket) you get to ride the funicular, walk the grounds, admission to the self-guided Apothecary Museum, see the worlds largest wine barrel (the tun) and enjoy amazing panoramic views of the city. If you are interested in more detail buy the 5 Euro audio-guide. Also, for an additional 5 Euros you can take the guided tour which gives you entrance to some of the interior chambers. Tours are on the hour usually from 11 am-4 pm. They have tours in English and German.

Since 1214 the castle has been damaged by wars (Thirty Years War), two lighting strikes in 1754 and weathering over 800 years. Only the Friedrich's building has been restored. The figures on the the outside are reproductions but the originals can be seen if you take the guided tour. The Apothecary Museum has 20,000 objects covering 2,000 years of western pharmacy history.. The Tun housed in the barrel building 1591 is the world's largest wine barrel measuring 23' high X 27' wide. It was built in 1725 and holds 58,000 gallons. The Great Terrace has spectacular views of the city of Heidelberg and the Neckar Valley and River. The Hortus Palatinus (palace gardens) were created in the 17th century. The Elizabeth Gate built by Friedrich V for his wife Elizabeth Stuart is another highlight.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,"A hike to get to, but well worth it","This palace is near the top of a hill, as you would expect, but is very worth the effort to get to.
First off, you will get to see the oldest Renaissance building in Germany. Secondly, you will be able to see a single wine cask capable of holding 58,000 gallons of wine. Lastly, you'll be able to see some if the destruction inflicted upon some of its features hundreds of years ago.",

If you feel like the exercise you can walk up the several hundred steps to get to the top, but be warned it‚Äôs an epic.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,You Will Want to Visit,"Perched on the hillside overlooking town, you are almost compelled to visit.

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,A must in Heidelberg,"Once in Heidelberg you can't escape the old palace/castle - a must visit and quite interesting. Unfortunately often a bit overrun with tourists. great views and many things to explore in the castle. Ticket is only 8 euro and includes the pharmacy museum and I think also the funicular up the mountain. Otherwise, prepare to walk",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Amazing Structure - Must see!,Perched on a picturesque hillside these ruins are magnificent! A mix between Renaissance and Roman it‚Äôs hard to beat! Take your time strolling the grounds and definitely get the headset and map. It‚Äôs packed with info on each part of the Palace. Great stories too. Go down and see the worlds largest wine vat.. imagine tapping that beast in the day! The whole country side could party. Make sure you listen the story about the ‚Äúfootprint‚Äù on the back terrace... great story!! I think at one time this place was one of the most notable collection of buildings in the entire Roman Empire. Gotta see it if you are in the neighborhood,
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Amazing views,"Overlooking the town and the river below, the castle is very impressive looking. It costs 8 ‚Ç¨ to take the funicular up to the castle grounds and walk around. Paying 8 ‚Ç¨ seemed a bit expensive me at first but it includes use of the Funicular Railway, the Great Tun and the German Apothecary Museum in addition entering the courtyard. I think paying a couple Euro for each of those activities is reasonable. The pharmacy museum is very interesting to look through and will take you about 20 to 30 minutes. A visit of the castle grounds itself is about 30 minutes plus some time to walk the garden. If you want to see inside the castle you will need to pay an extra 5‚Ç¨ for the tour which is offered in German and English.

On a spring morning, walking up the hill to visit the palace was a good workout. The views of the river, fields and houses were worth the trip for me. There are fantastic city views from the top. The castle itself was nothing special. But I must admit that I did not hire a guide or go inside the paid areas.

The gardens were lovely pretty despite the gray drab weather we were having that day. Definitely worth the hike up just for the view alone which is free depending on how you walk up. The way we walked up we had no choice but to pay when we got to the top.","Written May 23, 2019"
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,What a treasure,"We visited the castle yesterday. Our funicular ticket also covered castle admission, and we booked an English tour which was superb.

He couldn‚Äôt possibly been any more WRONG! The castle ground are gorgeous and so well kept. The views from the castles overlooking Heidelberg are breathtaking. I recommend to go as we did, with the Bergbahn all the way to the top and work your way down leaving the castle for last. Skip any sightseeing tour guides, they are expensive and extremely unnecessary (there are guided tours available at the castle).",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Very cool castle,"I have been to larger castles, older castles, more historic castles and more splendid and elegant castles...but this one will be one of my favorites. A vanacular or short walk gets you to the main grounds, from where you can wander around the grounds, some of the castle and the main garden, before wandering into the main castle courtyard. Look over the sides to get a true appreciation for how high this castle rises, and to spend a little time really looking into the structure and construction is worth the effort. The big wine barrel is gimicky, and worth about 30 seconds of your time to gawk at, but take the 30 seconds. Truly gorgeous views of the river valley. Hope to come back in the future...sometime.","Written April 26, 2019"

If you can spare the extra 5 Euro for the guided tour, I would do it so you get to see the inside of the castle but honestly the outside of the castle would really suffice just fine to get your castle fix. Absolutely go to the wine cellar which you don't need the guided tour ticket to see the MASSIVE wine barrel. It was incredible and a wino's dream! You can climb up to the top of the 26 ft high barrel. The gardens were even pretty despite the gray drab weather we were having that day.

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Beautiful castle,"This a beautiful castle that allows you to enjoy the beauty of Heidelberg from high up too.

The castle itself is partially in ruins. Somehow this makes it all the more beautiful to walk around and take in. From all angles the castle is a stunner.

The grounds were being maintained by some elderly gentlemen who looked like they volunteered to do it, took great pride in what they were doing, and they were doing an immaculate job.

The only downside was the somewhat large group of Chinese tourists who ran around screaming and being disrespectful to everyone else there. It was a shame they were behaving they way they were. It didn't detract from the castle just the atmosphere that I figure would normally be extremely serene.","Written March 8, 2019"

The railway to the top of the castle was out of service so we took a free bus to the top. Also, from Heidelberg main station to the castle is about a 40 minute walk (through the old town which is lovely) or you can take a local bus for ‚Ç¨1.40. The tour lasted about an hour and was full of great information. After, we were able to walk the complex and visit the *free* medicine museum which was also 5 stars. The grounds have a few restaurants/cafes and places to sit if you would like to bring your own lunch. We spent about 3 hours there including the tour, museum and lunch! Highly recommended!",

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,BvB - Union Berlin match,"As a 40th birthday trip for my brother, 3 of us made a pilgrimage from Aberdeen to Dortmund for the weekend.

I cannot recommend a trip to the football in Dortmund enough, facilities are amazing, fans are second to none and we had an amazing time. Transport from the city centre to the stadium was quick and clean. Food and beer outside the stadium is varied, plentiful, delicious and cheap. The crowd control and security was professional, efficient and friendly, particularly to three half-cut British idiots. The match was amazing and we partied into the night with local fans in the various venues around the stadium.

If you want a fun weekend at one of the greatest sporting venues on the planet, Dortmund should be well up on your list.",
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Fantastic atmosphere,Visited with my husband to see a football game as we had heard that it was one of the best teams to see for a fantastic atmosphere.

Was initially put off as it‚Äôs standing only but only added to the atmosphere and made for great viewing. Highly recommended!,
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Awful Experience,"We booked the 4pm ENGLISH Tour, we were given headphones by our tour guide and we were made to listen to a pre recorded tour-guide while the person showing us around spoke only German (although his English was perfect) and went into a lot more detail which left us stood around listening to nothing.

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,A great football stadium,"Signal Iduna Park is one of the most beautiful stadium of the world. During stadium tour you go through players' changing rooms, tunnel, dugout, Yellow Wall Stand... Worth of visit!",
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Slightly Let Down...But Still Great,"I recently decided to go on a 3 country tour of some of the world's top ""football"" stadiums and was absolutely ecstatic when I saw BVB had a home game while I was on my trip. The atmosphere was excellent, though I was more impressed by the away Cologne fans. Despite being down the entire game, the Cologne were incredible. Maybe because it was a Friday night game against Cologne it didn't have the normal energy, but it was still the 2nd best stadium atmosphere of those I visited (Valencia was #1) . Why only 4 stars when everyone else has 5 stars?

The reason for my ""only"" 4-star review, is due to the fact that they still allow smoking in the stadium, and breathing in smoke for over 2 hours straight isn't something you have to do in most public places anymore thankfully. Of all the games I have gone to in other countries, they have stopped this, but here at BVB you can easily be surrounded by chain-smoking fans for a few hours which sucks for us non-smokers. I was also shocked by how often people were getting in and out of their seats.
Seriously, a half is 45 minutes people! On a positive note though, the fans were super friendly and made you feel as you were one of them. There was definitely a family type atmosphere here which isn't common elsewhere.

All of those negatives out of the way, it is still an experience that any sports fan needs to do if in the area and was a great time. Tickets were sold out when I checked a week in advance both on the empty seats and secondary market that are sold at list price by other BVB ticket holders on the BVB website. I kept checking every few hours and finally, there were some seats on the BVB secondary market website available and I picked one up for a very fair price. I was thrilled to not have to buy one on the stubhub/viagogos of the world and risk being scammed. I was not able to print the ticket at home, but I was able to pick it up at the stadium on the day of the game or right before the game which was fine. You can pick up the tickets at the fan shop which is right out in front of the stadium, you cannot miss it.

The parking shuttle from the University was really well done. The lot is, called the ""Parkplatz TU Dortmund Campus Nord"" so search for that on Google and it will take you right there. There were busses there constantly taking people to and from the game, and at only 2 Euros was a great deal. The bus takes you back a little further up the road from where you get dropped off, but was still great and getting out from the parking lot at the University which was so easy compared to navigating the lots around the stadium would have been.","Written January 28, 2020"
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Best live sporting event I‚Äôve ever experienced,This was the highlight of our two week trip to Germany.

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,What a Stadium!,"I have travelled across Europe watching football and Borussia Dortmund has been on my radar for some time due to its legendary atmosphere. At last I made it with my son and a mate and it really is worth the visit.
The Stadium itself is awesome to look at and to watch from and the supporters do not let up with a constant noise throughout the game, continually getting behind their side, even when they were not playing brilliantly.

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Big Yellow Wall,"Very big football stadium; impressive in size and scale. The terrace areas show just what's missing in English football grounds today.
The first construction was c1974 but has been added to over the years yet the stadium still looks very modern. The tour itself details the history of the stadium, BVB and some of the famous games that have been played there.We saw the home and away dressing rooms, the media zones (as seen on TV) but missed the museum which is having a refurb at the moment. We walked through the players tunnel, sat in the executive seats and also stood on the yellow wall and shouted to hear the echo.

Overall it was a brilliant experience and in terms of atmosphere it is one of the best stadiums I've been to.

I bought the tickets on Viagogo so had to pay more than the face value of the tickets but it was still worth it.",
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,"Great stadium, great fans, great prices","Saw the SuperCup between BVB and Bayern Munich.
Still one of the greatest stadia in the world and got to be on the bucket list of any football fan.
Key takeaways were standing, drinking beer in the stands, smoking in the stands and rival fans mixed in together without a hint of trouble.
Not allowed in with small backpack so had to check it in at a small shack. Just 50cents!
Main way of buying food and beer inside stadium was using a yellow prepaid card so have to seek out cash bars or find a way to get the prepaid cards (we didn‚Äôt figure it out)

 ",
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,World class football experience,"I admit being a Dortmund BvB üñ§üíõ fan. But I do think any football loving soul would appreciate visiting this stadium, refered to as the Temple.

Clearly the best way to visit is the see a home match however tickets are hard to come by as the 81.365 people stadium often is sold out (!!!).

You can also buy a stadium tour online, which is about 15euro for 60min express tour. You will get behind the scene and visit mixed zone, the locker room, sit in the dog-out and come close to the amazing south stand (Gelbe Wand) which is the home of appr 25k hardcore BvB fans on match days.

Next door to the stadium you will find an amazing BvB fan shop (Fan Welt) which is a great way to sense the magnitude of the club.",
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Unforgettable experience,"One of the must-do football experiences in Europe - the 'Yellow Wall' needs to be seen to be believed. We were there for the 2-0 win over Wolfsburg, and although most of the game was poor, we'll never forget the display that the home end of the stadium put on before the match. To be fair, it's not the most impressive stadium we've visited - some of the concourse areas are particularly grotty and ugly - but it's definitely worth a visit.

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Generally fun Atmosphere but a miserable place to watch a match,"Did not live up to the hype....Having been to multiple sporting events in the US and UK (we love Premier League football)....as my husband said, we are glad we went to Signal Iduna Park, it was an experience, but we will not go back. We are a family of 4, love sporting events and tailored our spring break so that we ended up at the BVB vs Stuttgart match - our two teenage daughters (15 and 18) love Christian Pulisic.

The things we liked.....the stadium is pretty and the fans are fun to watch. Atmosphere inside and out is interesting and festive. Although we are not huge beer drinkers, the beer was really good - and you can buy as much beer as you can carry, drink it in the stadium and carry it outside the stadium with you. They even provide carriers for up to 6 beers.

The things we did not like...PURCHASING TICKETS (tried for weeks before the game) - We have discovered that UK and European clubs want try to keep scalpers at bay by controlling who has the privilege of buying tickets. This is bad for someone wanting to attend one random match - we found that none of the resellers (including web providers like viagogo) will tell you exactly what seats you are purchasing so you only get a general idea of the section. We ended up calling the concierge at our hotel and used a ticket broker because we were worried about the legitimacy of the web sites - even he would not tell us the exact seats and we ended up on the very top row of the entire stadium - would not have bought them had we known and we of course paid a fortune. ENTERING THE STADIUM (1.25 hours before start time) massive crowds pushing, chaos, no order whatsoever, we were almost separated from our daughters several times. Took us almost an hour to get in. SEATING - All sections are blocked and fenced so that you cannot go through other sections. Our seats were 6-9 and we had to walk through 20+ people to get to them - there was one way in and out. So basically our row was about 50-60 seats across with an entry on each side and a bar in the middle to keep you from exiting the other side. PURCHASING FOOD/DRINKS - My husband stood in a long line to purchase food, only to discover that they do not take credit cards or cash. You must stand in another long line to purchase a prepaid stadium card that you use to purchase food and beverages. Since we had to try to guess how much we might spend, we were stingy about what we bought so we didn't have to stand in line for another card. We would have bought more if we could use cash or credit card directly at the vendor. SMOKING - Hey...""environmentally conscious Germans"".....FYI - smoking pollutes the air and causes cancer. Solar panels on every roof are not offsetting how your cigarette smoke is ruining the environment! As soon as one stopped, another would light up. The air in the stadium is thick and difficult to breathe. We could not get out of the stadium fast enough to fresh air. We all had headaches for hours afterwards.

Glad we went once - Life is about experiences, but we will not go here again. The good news is we got to see Christian play for 12 minutes and he had an assist and a goal. He's moving to Chelsea and we will be thrilled to go there next year - glad we have no reason to go back to Signal Iduna Park!",
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Beautiful stadium,"The real gallery of fans for sure you will find here.
Amazing athmospfere!

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Tremendous stadium,"Here for a Champions League tie, my first visit to this awesome stadium was very positive. Situated in the large Westfalen Park, it's only a four stop, 5 minute U-bahn ride from the centre of town. No problems with the Dortmund fans who were friendly throughout. An awesome atmosphere was generated though the Spurs fans certainly also played their part. I had no problem taking a bag for life in once it had been searched though there is also a 'left luggage' type facility opposite the away turnstiles. Excellent two-level club shop with caf√© is also recommended.

No delays on getting out afterwards meant we were soon back on the nearby coaches. Get there early if you can as it can be a bit difficult to find your way round until you get used to it. They could also do with banning smoking, at least in the stands. Still, a great venue and a great trip.","Written March 10, 2019"
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,SECOND VISIT AND STILL A GREAT STADIUM,This is a fantastic stadium inside and outside and may only gripe about it would be the time it takes to get 3600 away fans through half a dozen turnstiles. The stadium facia is wonderful on all sides and the transport links by S-Bahn and U-Bahn are just a few minutes walk. Inside the view is wonderful even though you're in one corner of the ground...unlike at PSV for instance which is awful. The atmosphere generated by the home fans is great and it's even better when matched by the away support as it was by Spurs fans.

I drove there from London, aiming to get there so early that I could fully enjoy my first visit.
Parked right next to the stadium. Food and drink was fantastic. The club shop couldn't be better. The actual stadium itself was amazing. They have bar football and many games for young people / children to play with. The ground has a no cash policy so just put everything onto your bank card. The view from my far away seat was still good. The atmosphere generated by the home supporters was incredible, I even shed a tear as they 'belted out' You'll Never Walk Alone before kick off. If you've ever heard the Liverpool support sing this then Dortmund KNOCK THE SOCKS OFF them!
After the match, my son and I sat in the supporter bar and watched the highlights of other matches from around Europe.

On Friday evening we had an invite to meet a legend, the invite included beer and bratwurst, only down side the talk is in German but that has to be expected!
Also available is a stadium tour. Small fee of ‚Ç¨5 but it takes you pitchside, the tunnel, dugouts and to experience the Fan Wall, standing area behind the goal.
The final gift in the box is entry to the museum. This includes the history and trophy room.
For a great football experience this is a must.
What‚Äôs not included is transport getting there. Dortmund has a small airport, served from the UK by easyJet from Luton and Ryanair from Stansted.

Firstly I have to say what a pleasure it was to be one of the away supporters, and how friendly the Stadium staff were to us. From looking in the club shop, to the respect shown when being searched prior to entering the stadium with the German stewards being friendly towards us. I have to say prior to entering the food on sale was reasonably priced and of good quality and with the stadium having a no bag policy there was a place for away supporters to leave there bags (a yellow building opposite the away entrance) The stadium is big and the Atmosphere was amazing. Tottenham won 1-0 to progress to the quarter finals a fantastic result. On the final whistle the away and home fans left at the same time with no issues. A great experience and would recommend a visit to this wonderful stadium",

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,English speaking stadium tour well worth the money & and a recommended visit,"Having travelled to Dortmund for a day visit we decided we'd like to go and see the Borussia Dortmund Westfalenstadion just to say we'd been, and I must say it was worth it.

Roughly a 15 minute train ride from Dortmund Central Station then a 5 minute walk from the Westfalenhallen Station.

At the stadium there is a large club shop and cafe which is open to the public. Inside the shop is also a counter selling tickets for both the Stadium tour and Borussia Dortmund Club Museum.

We hadn't been planning on doing the Stadium Tour but we were lucky enough to visit shortly before an English speaking tour was due to take place (1.00PM on a Saturday) and with a price of 12 Euros for an hours guided tour then free access to the Club Museum we quickly snapped some tickets up and weren't disappointed.

Our tour guide had a very good knowledge of her subject matter, and the tour included the Players entrance, reception/media interview area, Changing rooms, Stands, Pitch side Home & Away Dugouts and even the Police Custody area to name just some components.

We got the chance to take loads of great photos, but you mustn't go on to the pitch (quite rightly).

Afterwards we spent a good half hour or so looking round the massive club shop (situated on two floors), then went to the Club Museum.

The Museum is also good, but just about all the displays are currently only in German. This said, having spoken to the staff just before we left (Doh!) to enquire if there are future plans for other languages to be included on the display information, we were told there is an audio guide available, so for all non German speakers ask about the audio guide on your arrival.

Outside of the Stadium was a food truck doing a roaring trade (not least I suspect due to it's very reasonable prices), and adjacent to the current Stadium is Borussia Dortmund's original stadium that looks like it's probably utilised as a training venue these days.

We spent nearly 3 hours at the Stadium (would have been longer if I'd have known about the Museum audio guide) and all three of us who went would throughly recommend a visit and feel that the guided tour was worth the money.",

Once inside the atmosphere was superb as was the spectacle of the fans for both sides. Watching 20000 plus people all jumping at once in unison was superb.

But the Frankfurt fans were also great with hundreds of flags along with the flares. I have to say the fans were far more entertaining than the game.

We receive a 30 second sound clip and then sit waiting for 5 mins while Germans get an in depth description. Out of all the stadiums I‚Äôve visited this has to be the most frustrating.

We were not in the Gelbe Wand itself but the side next to it. At first it was like ""i want to be in the GW"" but afterwards I found my place ideal because you could see the GW: jumping altogther, singing altogther, so It was perfect.

The fanshop was really croweded before the game. You also have to get a Dortmund Card where you can upload money (easy to do in the stadium itself).",

Outside of the stadium , you can get food and drink and just sit around soaking up the atmosphere. We walked to the stadium from the main square in Dortmund, if you don‚Äôt stop it about a 40 minute walk, we stopped on route for a few beers",
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Great day out!,"We travelled over from Cologne on the train to Dortmund but had to collect tickets from the University as we‚Äôd prebooked ‚Äòyellow wall‚Äô standing.
From the University we walked3km to the stadium which was quite nice in the sun but we could have got a lot closer via the local tram service from the main train station.
The fanzone was great fun with beer, sausages, pretzels and singing.
We had decent banter with the rest of the Dortmund fans too.
Getting into the ground took a good twenty mins so give yourselves plenty of time if you are on the yellow wall!
There‚Äôs a safe standing area in the top section but the middle and bottom sections are ‚Äònormal standing‚Äô with the bottom section reserved for the Ultras only...so stay out of there!
Stewarding was pretty good on the kop and you didn‚Äôt feel too tightly packed in.
It was pretty old school though with beer everywhere and plenty of smoking around us (not just tobacco either!!)
Dortmund lost but the atmosphere was still really good.
Tram back to Dortmund HBF was pretty efficient but make sure that you get your directions right!
Expensive to get tickets on yellow wall but worth it for a one off experience!",
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Worth a visit but beware,"Watching a Dortmund home game is one of the ‚Äúmust dos‚Äù for a football fan and the atmosphere here is fantastic as you‚Äôd expect, with pretty much every game an 80,000 plus sellout.

Just be aware that with the steep terraces the view from many of the seats isn‚Äôt that great (see picture) and also amazingly smoking is allowed everywhere, which many people take advantage of. Both of these factors negatively impacted our visit.",
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Enjoying,"Nice stadium. Not too croudy. 81000+ spectators and still leaving stadium (by walking) is easy. Maybe a few more toilets would be nice, but what can you expect when 81600+ people are trying to go toilet in 15 minutes. Not too long waiting time for beer and bratwurst. Why I took stars away?

Once inside the stadium we were seated to the right of the main stand ( the wall to our left and Freiburg supporters to our right ) which provided great views and an atmosphere to savour.

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,What a stadium!,"I did the English speaking tour of the stadium with a German friend who is also a supporter of Borussia Dortmund. I am a Liverpool supporter who had heard a lot about this stadium from friends who were there at the 2001 Uefa Cup Final between Liverpool and Alaves. They all said it was an amazing place and they weren't wrong! The tour lasted around 90 minutes and was very thorough and informative. Our guide was a delightful young lady who was clearly passionate about her football team. We got to see the dressing rooms, the TV interview area, sat in the most expensive seats in the stadium, walked down the players tunnel to and sat in the dugout seats. Dortmund's former manager/coach (Jurgen Klopp) is now the manager/coach at Liverpool FC so it was a huge privilege for me to be able to sit in what was his seat in the dugout area, although the guide told me that he rarely sat down as he was usually so animated! We stood on the famous South Stand terrace known as the Yellow Wall. It was immense and I would love to attend a Dortmund game one day and be in amongst the fans on that terrace. If you are a fan of football and find yourself in Dortmund then you really must do this stadium tour. You should do it even if you're not a fan of football! It is truly one of the great stadiums in the world and I cannot recommend this tour highly enough.

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Brilliant tour,"I visited the stadium with my 9 year old son. We had a fab time. 20‚Ç¨ entrance fee for the two of us. You can choose either a tour in English or German; check the times on line before you go. We had difficulty finding the entrance, it‚Äôs to the left of the stadium, to the right of the pub
The tour took us in the changing rooms, into the press area, in the teams seating areas and the fan areas. The tour was very informative and the guide spoke very good English. We were within 5m of the pitch, but your not allowed on it or to touch it

I‚Äôve done other football stadium tours, this was on par with them for a fraction of the cost
Tour is approximately 90 mins

It s a huge stadium and the bit youre really looking to see is the Wall which is the biggest standing stand of at stadium in the world. We got tickets for match and sat opposite the Wall so my other half was psyched.

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Excellent tour,"My husband and I did this tour simply because we'd never been inside a football/soccer stadium before and were curious. We aren't fans of Dortmund in particular, but even without knowing much about the club, we were both really entertained and interested during the tour. You get to see everything from the VIP seats to the media tunnel to the locker room to right next to the field (don't touch the grass - they cautioned us repeatedly about that). The tour guide spoke excellent English and told us lots of amusing anecdotes about the stadium and a few players. The part at the end where you stand in the Yellow Wall and cheer was a bit hokey, but would probably be much more enthralling for fans of the club who either do it all the time during games or who have always wanted to.

There were quite a few tours running around the same time as ours and there were lots of people on all of them, so I would definitely recommend booking earlier rather than later as the tours seem to sell out a few days in advance.","Written September 27, 2017"

The tickets... I was unsure where to get tickets and google searches took me Viagogo. Very over priced but appeared to be a 'legalised touting company'. Quite stressful waiting for the tickets... that never arrived... contacted them via twitter and they replied ... a lot of hassle, a lot of messing about but eventually was sent to an address where there were numerous fans picking up envelopes / tickets.

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Great tour sad museum,"First of all lets get this straight, I'am not a Dortmund fan, i just love soccer and i visit popular soccer stadiums so this is a totally unbiassed review. Lets start on the tour. I don't speak German so i have to go to the english speaking tour which sadly only occurs on a few days of September 2017. Ive been to quite a few stadiums and i have to say this is one of the best because of the amount of freedom they give you. The tour exclusively brings you around the entire stadium including the vip seats, changing rooms, player benches on the pitch etc etc. The tour guide is friendly, very informative and entertaining. Each tour group is around not too big so don't worry about not getting enough attention. Now on to the museum. It is located on the second floor and sadly was quite a disappointment. Despite the clubs rich history, it was pretty small which wasn't the main problem. The MAIN problem was that 80% of the exhibits were in German so whoever was visiting and not German speaking would sadly have to stare at the pictures. The trophy room was pretty cool though. The staff there was friendly and answered all the questions that i asked e.g wheres the toilet or if the team is having a public training any time soon. The est time of the museum is 1/2-1 hour for Non- German speaking people.","Written September 7, 2017"

If you are coming from a non smoking country however be warned Germany is still liberal on this front and smoking is allowed in stadium and if your in seats at the top of stands then smoke will rise and becomes a problem

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,GREAT Stadium Tour!!,"This has been my son's (age 20) favorite soccer/futbol team for years. It has always been his dream to visit the stadium. I bought tickets for the english tour a few weeks before our visit. I'm so thankful that I did as it was sold out and they were turning people away since they only take a maximum of 40 people. Our tour guide was EXCELLENT. I worried that we would have trouble hearing with 40 people but his voice carried so well that there was never a problem. We saw the VIP and news journalist areas, the locker rooms, and walked through the tunnel to music and sat on the player's bench. We ended the tour with all of us standing right in the middle of the famous yellow wall. Our tour guide led us in a cheer and we could hear how well we echoed with just 40 of us only to imagine what 25,000, just in that section alone, at a game must sound like.

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Great atmosphere for any sports fan!,"Even if you're not a huge football fan, this is a wonderful atmosphere for sports lovers! The home crowd is loud, knowledgeable and friendly. 80,000+ singing their hearts out to ""You'll never walk alone"". It's obvious the Dortmund players love playing for this crowd! Recommend getting there early (at least 2 hours before kickoff) to allow for parking if you're driving, walking to the stadium, finding your seats, getting food & drink card, etc. Plus, the game day atmosphere is very festive and with food stands lining the streets of the neighborhood, serving traditional German fare brats, beer, etc -- get there early & soak it up! A word of caution, even though all bags are searched upon entering the stadium, only small handbags/purses are allowed inside the gate. Mine was too big! Luckily, the guard realized I was American and not aware of the strict size limitations, so he checked it thoroughly, tagged it and let me in. Another word of caution: if sitting next to visitor fan section, you might get beer thrown on you when the visiting team scores. This was not an issue for us as we were casually dressed, it was a warm spring day, and we were just henjoying a really intense game in the Bundesliga. An older couple in our section however did not see the fun in getting drenched in beer and angrily left halfway through the match. All in all, I loved seeing European football amidst this most electric of fan bases in a beautiful setting!

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Dortmund`s amazing Yellow wall,"Visited the Signal Iduna to watch Dortmund play Hamburg on a Tuesday night, we bought tickets through Viagogo so paid a lot more than the basic price! What an unbelievable experience! We arrived at the ground around 2 hours before kick off and after getting through the outer turnstiles had a walk around the inside of the ground! The security staff were excellent allowing us to take photos from the different stands. If you want to buy any food or drink you have to purchase a card from one of the very helpful staff located all around the ground, advise them how many Euros you want and they will validate the card ready for use.
We were located in the famous yellow wall S√ºdtrib√ºne (South Bank) Europe's largest terrace! The view was excellent and the atmosphere was sensational, the fans sang for 90 minutes and it really was an experience we will never forget! If you really want to be in the noisy part of the wall then sections 12,13 and 82 are for you! We were in section 84 which was not as noisy buy still very vocal, one thing I would suggest is if you buy tickets for the yellow wall arrive early as it gets packed long befire kick off! Also you can still drink alcohol and smoke whilst watching football in Germany! At the end of every home game the team comes down to the yellow wall to thank the amazing support which was great to see! In all this is a must for any football fan looking to visit one of the world's best football atmospheres! The fans were extremely friendly and made us feel very welcome! A fantastic venue highly recommended! The transport links are excellent only a few minutes walk away! If you already have your ticket for the game you can travel free from Dortmund Hauptbahnhof main train station which is around 7 minutes away!",

Chris had a few stories about each section without droning on too long. the group of us (45 people) did a few BVB chants while in the Sudtribune (yellow wall) which was to get the noise effect, good fun. A worthwhile visit for any football fan if you are in Dortmund.",

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Unbelievable Atmosphere,"I travelled here in February with a group of mates to watch Borussia Dortmund v RB Leipzig.

The Stadium is easy reaching distance from the centre of Dortmund.
We used the Metro direct route from the main station.
This is free if you have a match ticket.

A bit of confusion on where exactly to enter the ground for our area and we queued up for 15 minutes in the wrong place and had to start again.so just beware but it was no issue.

There where small pop up Lager only Bars as soon as we got into the ground and then ample main Bars.
They all supplied the three pint carrier which I would recommend if you intend to have a few pints as coming out during the match is a tad difficult and pretty pointless.
""yes they don't treat you like children you can have a pint"" :-)

We where in the standing enclosure opposite ""The Wall"" and although I will probably visit that end of the stadium at some time I can definitely recommend looking toward it as it is an amazing spectacle ( 37,000 all standing ).
The atmosphere in the stadium when the Chanting and singing starts and especially when ""The Wall' comes alive is second to none even for Neutral supporters like myself.
As a person who appreciates Football not just my own beloved team I can recommend this as a fantastic day and in my experience friendly day out.

We got a flight from Birmingham to D√ºsseldorf and then the train to Dortmund.
We stayed at a hotel in Dortmund and walked to the ground which took around 30 minutes.
We were told that in order to get a good place arrive early (2 Hours before kickoff!) which we did.Entering the ground was very simple and the stand holding 25000 was already 2/3 full!
An amazing atmosphere and Dortmund won 6-2.
Dortmund is a very friendly ground and drinking watching the game was novel given it's not allowed in the U.K.
My advice is for all football fans you need to experience just how good this is.","Written March 9, 2017"
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Guided tour around the stadium!,"Great guide, not to large groups, a reasonable price and a world-class experience! By watching a BvB match in Singal Iduna Park a day in advance, you really get to experience the true soul of german Bundesliga and the exitement and passion for the club. Top notch!","Written March 6, 2017"
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,A must!!,"My boyfriend is a fan of Dortmund and bought some tickets for us to go see Dortmund play at home. Although I don't follow up with German fu√üball, it was an amazing experience! I loved the atmosphere and the people!","Written March 5, 2017"
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,A Historic moment.....,We was visiting from Norway and looking forward to see the match between Dortmund and Wolfsburg. But the wall was closed ;-( Hope this will be the last time with the wall closed and missing 25 000 supportes.,
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Must Do!,I travelled here in 2014 with my best man as a wedding present from my wife. We were in the yellow wall to watch Dortmund vs Mainz and it was a great game. The fans were very friendly and the atmosphere in the stadium is great. Lots to do after the game with stands and a gig on. Will definitely be back one day!,"Written February 24, 2017"
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Westfalen Stadium Wonderful!!,Even with the Yellow Wall not in action the atmosphere in this ground is amazing!! Excellent view and great food/beer!!,
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,A Football Fan Must,"In February 2017 I was part of a group of guys (7 of us) who went to Germany so see a friend and his brother who had moved back out there. We were fortunate enough to get hold of Borussia Dortmund tickets, playing at home to RB Leipzig. Now German football is well renowned for very reasonable ticket pricing and if you can get them their side, you will pay a decent admission. However due to time constraints and most of us really wanting to experience what is regarded as one of the best atmospheres in football we bought them in a slight hurry from an English ticket agency and did pay extra for these. They worked out about ¬£70, which was double their true worth but we agreed actually it was still worth it to get in. These were not the best tickets in the house by any stretch (this was a sell-out) and we were behind the goal (opposite the Yellow Wall) and in the top tier. So although we weren‚Äôt in touching distance of the players the benefits from that high up meant we had a good view of the whole game and there were no view distortions from being at a too low angle. It also gave us a great view of the famous Yellow Wall and their very energetic fans!
The ground was easy to find, we were fortunate enough to be driven there through our friends, following a Sat Nav and parking was ample. However the place was packed. We wanted to catch some lunch before the game (it was moved to a 18:30 KO for TV, usually they are 14:30) and were there 4 or 5 hours before. It seemed something else was going on but a number of very big car parks were exceptionally full looking even that early. I don‚Äôt know if that is the norm but something to think about if driving. We ended up in a multi storey car park just 1.6km down the road, which also led us passed places to eat and drink. Also very handily when we walked out of the stadium and back to the cars there was no traffic at all from where we parked but I imagine the closer ones would have taken some time to get out of. There was an underground station very close to the stadium I noticed.
At the stadium there are plenty of stalls selling official merchandise, food and drink or the main club shop itself, which was busy and a small queue to get into. Otherwise the gates are clearly marked and we found our section very easily. Once inside there are more food & drink stalls, again it was very easy to navigate up to our gate, row and seat. As a side note these stalls do not accept cash. Instead you have to buy a card and put money on it in increments of 5 Euros. Basically it is a little cheeky and means you will have money left over from your round, probably to use again next time for regular going fans.
Once inside the stadium you could immediately see what all the fuss is about. It holds around 80,000 and really is an impressive ground, splashed with yellow giving it a very authentic Dortmund feel. I have been lucky enough to see both Real Madrid and Barcelona play at their respective homes and the stars they have on offer but they aren‚Äôt particularly big singers ‚Äì more there to be entertained (which they can do in abundance). Our own football is well known for the atmosphere and chants / singing (albeit some of that is being lost with high ticket prices and corporate goers). However this was on a whole other level to anything I have seen or witnessed. Right from the off the guy on the tannoy geed up the crowd and was part of a very crowd inclusive team sheet naming. Then came the ‚ÄòNever Walk Alone‚Äô and another song leading right up to kick off, by which time the home crowd (and I mean all areas of the ground) were in full voice or shouting. Let us also give credit to the away fans, of which there were quite a few and made good noise themselves, really adding to the whole event. This was practically the theme from start to finish, just a wave of noise, chants and songs with loud tannoy announcements and drum beats to boot. When they say the atmosphere at Dortmund is one of the best and worth going for, they really didn‚Äôt lie.
Of course the foundation of all of this is the 25,000 strong Yellow Wall behind one of the goals. It was a remarkable experience to watch. The middle section of this just continuously jumped up and down all game but when the whole stand joined in, you couldn‚Äôt help but want to be in it too, taking part in it. It looked terrific and must be great fun to be there. The noise that stand generated alone was great and the rapport with the players was all too obvious to see, especially at the end of the game. After 90 minutes of full backing, the players went over and applauded back but then sat down for a minute or so, before getting back and a cross of dancing and pushing each other (in a friendly manner), while the Yellow Wall erupted again. It was quite a sight, this was only a league game after all and again was a brilliant live experience / atmosphere to be part of and something I have never seen before.
Somewhere in all of this was actually a game of football, which was not the best but entertaining enough in its own way ‚Äì Dortmund have some good and young & exciting players. For the superstars and goals, then Madrid and Barcelona are hard to beat but for pure, adrenaline, atmosphere and the whole package I cannot think I will go anywhere better than this. If you are a football fan, this is an absolute must.","Written February 16, 2017"
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Unbelievable atmosphere,"Arrived about 4.30pm for kick-off at 6.30 and the beer / food tents were already buzzing. Once inside, the atmosphere was unbelievable and continued throughout the match and beyond! An experience that I will never forget.
Easy to get to and from the ground. We went on the U-Bahn number 45 from the main rail station and there was one every minute or two. Same for leaving the ground; U-Bahns lined up as far as the eye could see and each one filled up, left, and was immediately followed by the next!","Written February 15, 2017"
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Amazing footballing experience,I have been to a lot of football games in Germany and this stadium and the city of Dortmund itself certainly has a special atmosphere on match day. The stadium is huge and you really do feel like you are visiting a huge football club when you visit. The atmosphere created by the ultras in the yellow wall is brilliant but in the other surrounding stands it does feel very touristy. I visited for the DFB Pokal game against Hertha Berlin on a Wednesday night and it was absolutely freezing so I would recommend for people to visit when the temperature isn't as low as I couldn't truly enjoy the experience that much due to the cold weather. As a lifelong Liverpool fan the version of You'll Never Walk Alone sang by the Dortmund fans was well worth the visit alone. The beer inside and outside the stadium is fairly priced and the underground takes you straight to the stadium and back. I would also recommend for people to stay in the surrounding city's of Bochum or Essen on a match day as your match ticket gives you free transport to as far away as Dusseldorf and the hotels in Dortmund are extremely expensive when Dortmund are at home. The hotels in the other city's are much cheaper and only 20 minutes away on the train.,"Written February 13, 2017"
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,What a football experience !,"A friend of mine has been nagging me to visit this stadium for some time and this week I finally got to go and it was amazing ! The yellow wall is everything it is described to be....,an awe inspiring sight when in full voice. The stadium itself is extremely impressive and has to be visited for any football fan particularly dedicated ground hoppers. German football has a wonderful spirit to it with great atmospheres which are far superior to the relatively sterile environments in England where professional football is often endured. This was fabulous !",
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Great stadium and fans,"I enjoyed my visit to see Dortmund play RB Leipzig. The surrounding areas to the ground are filled with official merchandise outlets and fairly priced beer, food and drink.
The club superstore is very smart and well stocked but like the stalls outside the prices are high.
Inside the ground the stadium is cashless and you need to get a pre paid card which is difficult to charge without needing a refund at the end of the game. Getting that refund is a hassle but possible. I don't like this system and ever will its a chance to fleece fans who do not have the time or patience to queue for a refund. The pricing structure ensures you will always need one too.
The food and drink is predictably more expensive inside and choices are limited.
The atmosphere and views and comfort in the ground are all excellent and a treat for any fan. I sat in the North Stand opposite the Yellow Wall which is a great place to take in the sights and sounds of the South Stand.
Overall and excellent ground to visit with friendly fans and a terrible stadium 'no cash' policy.","Written February 8, 2017"
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome.....","Went to BVB09 v RB Leipzig and got tickets on the yellow wall. Couldn't believe our luck.

This was a football experience like no other. Absolutely sensational. We were advised by the hotel to get there early as security can take some time but it was relatively quick and painless.

Those in the 25,000 yellow wall get there early as places are unallocated, except in blocks. We had Block 80 - 2/3rds up to the left of the goal - awesome views and noise.

Plenty of beer and food concessions around to bide your time if you do get there early - so no worries.

Watching the stadium fill up was a real treat and the atmosphere and noise was incredible.

The only downside is that smoking is allowed in the stadium - which meant everything we were wearing stinks of cigarettes - not like watching in the UK.

Overall I doubt that this football experience could be bettered - and even better, Dortmund won.....

A must do for the bucket list of any football fan.",
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Very impressive,A wonderful way to spend time. We were in a Saturday and we had a guided tour at 13.40 hours in english. The guide was a BVB fan si she did the tour with passion. She was very well prepared. We arrived earlier so we walk arround the fan shop and the sport center near the stadium. The tour has every important locations like the changing lockers and Die Gelbe Wand. The structure is very interesting and it's a must do if in Dortmund. The price is good for the excellent presentation (12‚Ç¨/pers). The Borrusseum is included in price.,
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Electrifying atmosphere,"Watched Dortmund play KOLN in the bundes liga game.

Goose bumps as the fans sing "" you never walk alone"". The continous chanting and the synchronised jumping was mesmerising, truly one of the best fans.

The stadium is cashless, you need to buy a card for food and drinks.

Do not wear any other competitive football club jersey.","Written January 31, 2017"
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Amazing atmosphere at Westfalenstadion!,"Anybody who wants to visit Germany and watch football must visit this stadium, whether you support Borussia Dortmund or not (probably best not to shout that out though). This place is magical, intimidating, and awesome!

I came here to watch a match and take the stadium tour. Tours occur everyday except match day. There is at least one tour in English and a long tour, which includes exploring the Sud, that is conducted in German. You get to visit most of the facilities inside the stadium and be ""butt buddies"" with your favorite players (you'll know when you get there). The tour guides are very friendly; mine was Alex and he was cracking jokes in English and German during the entire tour with the diverse guests including some Championship League followers. The stadium also houses a museum dedicated to Dortmund and its history starting from humble beginnings to international success.

Onto match day! The stadium is conveniently located next to a train station. If you are coming from the Hauptbahnhof, you can take the trains located on platforms 1 and 2 to get here. Be sure to get here early; there's a reason why the atmosphere is intense, and it's because there are so many people. If you want to avoid the crowd, get here early, enjoy a bite at Strobels, then head inside.

Some tips:
- Sit somewhere near the Sud! The people in the Sudtribune are loud, passionate, and very fun! There will be a lot of chanting, singing, and jumping and it will all be very infectious.
- Don't bring a big bag; the checkers will turn away people who carrying too much stuff
- Be polite and friendly! Everyone is here to enjoy the game!
- Don't be afraid to get emotional! If you love the sport, of course you're going to be emotional when something magical occurs! :) It's okay to look foolish while celebrating; everyone else around you probably looks foolish too.
- Arrive early
- Don't expect to leave ""on time."" There's a lot of people in the stadium who want to either go home or party after the game. If you take the train, don't expect to arrive at your destination on time. It's going to be crowded and it's better to just chill in the stadium and leave once the crowd dies down or to take a taxi.","Written January 18, 2017"
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Football Frenzy!!,"We attended Borussia Dortmund vs Augsburg in December. What an amazing experience. Probably without a doubt, one of the best Football experiences I've had. Stadium has so much character, fans make it awesome....
Only problem we had was leaving the stadium and trying to get public transport with 80 000 other people it seemed, became a little bit daunting for our 2 children. We did the Stadium Tour as well which I would highly recommend.","Written January 17, 2017"
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,"Stadium tour, in german","I've been to many top stadiums in Europe, camp nou, Allianz, bernabeau, san siro etc and done their tours, never have I had a problem completing these in English. Unfortunately the Dortmund tour was only available in German apart from weekends, I was in the area for 4 days, none of which were the weekend so since I'd come from D√ºsseldorf for the tour we completed it in German. Now this was ok, we got to see the stadium, changing rooms, press areas etc as I expected but obviously due to a complete lack of the German language understood pretty much nothing the guide was saying, he seemed very knowledgeable, talked a lot and others engaged him frequently so if I had understood I'm sure it was all good stuff.

Tour also gave you access to the Dortmund museum which again unlike many other top clubs had little to none English translations of what you were looking at, be it an old shirt, stadium plans etc. There did seem to be some of the newer exhibits translated but they accounted for maybe 10-15% of the total museum.",
Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Signal Iduna,"Magnificent stadium with easy reaching transportation. The tour guides spoke excellent English and gave detailed explanation of the history of clubs, former players and information about the current team.

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Fu√üball Temple,"I was lucky enough to visit the Westfalenstadion for the cup game against Union and can honestly say that it met all of the expectations I had built up. Easy enough to get to from the Central Station and the walk down Strobelallee to the stadium really gives one goosebumps when walking past the hordes of fans and the truck shops. For the really big and crazy BVB fans among you, the club shop sell toasters which imprint the club logo onto the bread so something to look out for.

We've all marvelled at the size of the ground which truly does take your breath away once you get inside. It was a pleasure seeing the Yellow Wall fill up way before the game began to start the terrific atmosphere and the rendition of YNWA was spectacular (I would have enjoyed it more but unfortunately I associate the song with Liverpool so I have to keep calm when hearing that tune). Terrific atmosphere, throughout, from the home and away fans. Hopefully, I'll get to return one day for a league game but if you have a chance to watch a game here, please take it.",

Parking is going to be a big problem.
It's either you head there 3 hours before if not just follow the general public and park along roads or nearby private properties.
It was so bad that most people started parking on grass patches as near to the stadium as possible.

Germany,Signal Iduna Park,Fantastic. DO NOT USE VIAGOGO,"We bought tickets for Dortmund v Werder Bremen for my husband and 2 of my boys for their christmas. We bought expensive tickets through VIAGOGO. Without going into great detail Viagogo took our money but we never got the tickets. They promised the tickets right up to the day of the match saying they would get them to the hotel. They then stopped answering our emails and we could not get in touch with them - we tried for days. We got our money back only because paypal took up the case on our behalf. After much running around and huge stress on my husband we bought tickets from a tout, not something we would recommend or usually do but we had a 4 day break based around this match.
Once in the ground it was amazing. They said it was the best football they have ever been to. The atmosphere both inside and outside the ground is fantastic.
The tour, taken on a different day was super. It was informative and well worth the money.

I came here in 30 Apr 2016 to watch the game Dortmund vs Wolfsburg. The capacity of this stadium is more than 80,000, and it's capacity audience in many of games . There there is always great atmosphere. Of course, it was capacity audience then. I'm surprised at the point that many children and women came in. In Japan, many children and many women come to football stadium, but there weren't children. I was surprised that. I think that is Europe's fact. That's why Bundesliga is great!!
And Dortmund won against the enemy and Shinji Kagawa, my favorite player got the goal. I was satisfied all things. This is the unforgettable thing for me. I hope to come there again.",

Germany,Herrenh√§user G√§rten,Worth the visit if you have some time in Hannover,"The Herrenhaeuser Garten is one of the nicest palace gardens I have ever visited. The grandeur and power of the time can be seen at this little (not so little) baroque jewel.

You can easily invest two hours at the place, although a quick one hour stroll can also end up working.

The fountains are nice, in particular the cascade at the entrance, right from the 17th century, as well as the monumental fountain at the heart of the gardens.

I visited the place in early spring and it was nice. I can only imagine how the gardens con look in August at the middle of the Summer.

Take a few minutes to relax, enjoy, and Loose yourself in the palace gardens, botanical gardens (less impactful) and the little museum that showcases a glimpse of the ‚Äúroyal‚Äù life in that part of the world, heavily influenced by other European countries, being France the main model followed.",

The palace itself was also closed. Ok, the ticket price was cheaper due to all of this and although much of it was closed it was still very impressive.

The interior seems to be still a work in progress as only the cafe and museum seem to be functional at the moment (July 17).

The central grand fountain was on and it looked so different from each different angle. The area looked equally beautiful even when the fountain stopped. The entire garden is well thought out in its symmetrical design. There are many garden ""rooms"" enclosed by hedges, each with a different design. I could spend a whole day here...",
Germany,Herrenh√§user G√§rten,Check when the fountains are on before you go,"These beautiful, formal gardens are at their best when the series of fountains are flowing, which is only for certain hours of each day. Then you are in for a treat, strolling around from one planned vista to another.
The formal gardens are not themselves a botanical wonder, but the Botanical Gardens across the street are (and entrance is included in some ticket packages). Here you will find lush flowers, greenhouses, mostly labelled, and beautifully tended.
Be sure you note that you once you enter the formal gardens and then exit for the Botanical gardens, you will not be able to enter the formal gardens again without permission from the ticket takers (who were easy about allowing us to come back so we could see the fountains in play).","Written June 13, 2017"

I can still feel that same warm sun on my face, the sound of a honeybee happily buzzing by, and the scent of flowers and green things. These gardens brought me such joy, I highly reccomend them.",

I can really reccomend the ""kleines fest im gro√üen garten"" which is a kind of variat√©/ comedy/ cabaret festival. What I dont like so much, is that you have to buy a ticket for the museum and the great garden in combination, even when you only want to see the garden - so only 4 out of 5 points for that reason.

The Schloss Herrenhausen Gardens can be easily reached by tram from Central Hannover. Do not hesitate to visit them any day. Our visit was out of blooming season and we still enjoyed them immensely.

You can go up to the TV tower to see the city and go to a cafe. The main thing is that the weather is good, in the fall when it drizzles and fogs, the views are not particularly impressive. I think you will find a TV tower without any problems. The entrance is not free, the upgrade on the Express Elevator.",
Germany,Rheinturm,"Entry could have been better, but overall a good trip","We booked in advance for a fixed time, two adults, two children, we arrived and were met by a queue, it was raining! We were lucky that we could stand within the doorway, but many others were not. Many people/decided to leave rather than stand in the rain. No explanation, no instructions, printed or otherwise, you simply stand in front of a barrier at the inner door.

At the time alloted, a man appeared with his mask under his nose and moved the barrier and let just one family group in, this meant the rest of us who had booked were left waiting.

A full twenty minutes after our alloted time and after the first group had entered, he returned and allowed the rest of us plebs to enter, however insisted that we all huddle together whilst he went outside for a breath of fresh air for five minutes. Eventually we were allowed to scan the barcodes (for tickets we had actually paid money for) and approach the lifts.

The first thing I noticed was the vast number of large benches where we could have all sat socially distanced with our masks on. Outside of the rain. Unfortunately whomever owns this place decided that time means nothing and proles standing in the rain isn't their concern.

Eventually we were greeted by a cheerful and friendly man who kindly escorted us and others all in the same lift up. I should say he spoke German only, but that is not a problem for us (as I work here and am fluent) nor will it be problem for you because he will still take you upstairs and is excellent as motioning to you when it is time.

Once we arrived we enjoyed the visit, we gazed upon the Alstadt, the Airport, the Cathedral, the boats as they navigated their way along the Rhine, the words someone had etched into the sand across the riverbank. The staff at the observation deck were very friendly and provided a good experience serving drinks and Nachos. The views are fantastic, especially as it hit sunset and a rainbow just managed to break it's way through the clouds.

I accept that this review may sound somewhat passive aggressive, I can only explain by asking, given they limit the number of visitors per hour, why is it not possible to simply allow us to scan our QR codes and enter the premises? We know the rules to sit apart from other groups not within our households, let us sit inside and wait instead of leaving us getting further frustrated outside in the rain? If it was summer time I would be delighted to join the back of the queue and bask in sunshine. It is, however, autumn and the preference is to stay under cover of rain.

I hope the management will read this, realise and change their policies, on the whole this is a great place to visit in Dusseldorf and we will be back again.",
Germany,Rheinturm,Easy access and great views,"Ascending this telecoms tower was a straightforward matter, even in the pandemic period with restricted numbers. Not expensive either.

Germany,Rheinturm,Ran around the Rheinturm,I took a run around the bridges and Altstadt and decided to run around the Rheinturm too. It is an imposing presence on the City and a nice experience to see it up close.,
Germany,Rheinturm,Nice view,"The view is very nice at night, it is very colourful because of the city lights. But except this everythung else should be improved. At the cafeteria are needed more employees to speed up the process. Can be open a small souvenir shop upstairs. And the souvenir window from downstairs needs to be moved at the exit not at the entrance because nobody will pay attention at it but will want to look at it before exit. Also need to be improved, too little souvenirs for a place like this!",
Germany,Rheinturm,"Great views, but the bar is eye watering","We decided to go up the tower as the sun set (highly recommend this). It was so peaceful looking down at the city watching it start to light up on one side as the sun set on the other.

There is a small lift from the ticket desk (just pay here - no need to book in advance). There are some facts on the ground floor as you await the lift. You are then whisked up to either the restaurant or viewpoint floors. We didnt go for dinner.

The viewpoint is great. All Window (floor to ceiling) panels explain what you can see from them including cities further on the horizon. A very relaxed atmosphere and it was not overly busy. There is no rush to get you down and out again and we spent almost an hour soaking in the view.

Unfortunately, the tower is a honey trap for tourists.... The price for two beers and nachos (a small bowl of cheese crisps with a salsa dip)!? Was extremely overpriced. It didnt ruin our trip though and the ticket price for this attraction is reasonable.

Definitely a must :)",
Germany,Rheinturm,You must go there if you are in D√ºsseldorf,"The price to go to the top is 9 euros, a bit overpriced. The prices on the bar on the top are a bit above average, but still much less than I expected. I just went there and bought the ticket in the ticket booth and then I was on the top of the tower in a few minutes.
Now the most important part: the view is amazing!!! I was particularly impressed by the Rhine and its wides curves, which are not noticeable from the ground. I was there in the afternoon of a nice day, I guess that at dusk and during the evening the view would be somewhat difference.

Germany,Rheinturm,Iconic tower in Dusseldorf with an observation deck and restaurant,"This is the highest tower in Dusseldorf. The Rheinturm, Rhine Tower, is almost 800 feet tall. There is an observation deck which you pay for separately because it is a long elevator ride. It also has a restaurant on the top. I would encourage you to make a reservation at the restaurant. If you do, your elevator ride is free to the restaurant. It‚Äôs just not free to the observation deck.
The Rhine Tower started construction in 1979 and was completed in 1982. The views from the tower are splendid. I would suggest you pick a clear day to maximize your photo opportunities. The restaurant is above the observation deck and it rotates completely around every 72 minutes.","Written February 21, 2020"

There's a bar/caf√© on the observation deck, which is neither good or affordable. So skip it and just enjoy the views.

Top floor houses a sushi restaurant, ""Qomo"". Quite peculiar to choose a distinctive food style for a top view establishment. For those who don't fancy sushi/asian food, there will be no ""eating with a view"".

The great architecture of the Medienhafen comes next to your attention and draws a clear picture of the architectonial ambitions.
Since the cities boundaries are not so vast one receives a very good overview and have amazing views on the Altstadt, K√∂nigsallee and alikes.
For those who want to indulge more there is fine dining upstairs from the crowd in the revolwing restaurant.

Not much people here in the afternoon which is gut so you can take pictures without them crowding. There is a cafe here with lots of spacious square tables and square stools. The tower closes at 12am so its exciting to go at night but I went there in the afternoon because there was bit of a drizzle in the morning. Also probably crowded at night during the prime summer months.

Any ways good visit and price is decent for all day. Before you get on, there is this guy in charge of the elevators will tell you to wait because it goes up 166,00m without any stops (takes 5-10 mins inbetween to rest) and it'll make your ears pop at 100m in the elevator.

It is the best meal I have had since I was in Hawaii 9 years ago.
The service was attentive but not overpowering.
We couldn't make a decision on the main course so the waitress let us order that afterwards. We really could find absolutley nothing to be negative over.
Yes the meal was not cheap but we have eaten in other towers ( CN Tower and Seattle) and this whole experience surpassed them both, so was worth every euro spent.

The top level of the tower is 546 feet (168 meters) above ground level and commands a BREATHTAKING VIEW of the entire city and the Rhein River. The restaurant and bar at the top goes all away around so walk around the top a couple times before sitting down to have a cool one. Take plenty of photos, too. No selfies, please !!

This is definitely a ""Must Do"" if visiting Dusseldorf. A once in a life time opportunity for most visitors. You will always remember.

Germany,Rheinturm,LOVELY HUGE TOWER,"This is a huge tower set on the river bank rising high into the sky and gets you some fantastic photos from below and from a distance. The bulb at the top lights up in blue at night and is worth seeing. However, I did not pay the asking price of 9 euros just to go up it and see views of Dusseldorf that can be seen for free elsewhere.","Written March 19, 2019"
Germany,Rheinturm,Perfect option,"Hi, All!
Well, when you are in town, such an experience could be nice, anytime.
You will arrive at 168 m high altitude and all the city will be at your feet.",
Germany,Rheinturm,Great city views,I went in late afternoon so that I could get some day and night photos. Can see over the city and old town but I think that the modern buildings near the waterfront are more impressive (worth walking to as nearby and get good views back towards the tower). A bit pricey for the coffee and cake but muck as you would expect given the location.,"Written March 5, 2019"
Germany,Rheinturm,Enjoyable,"Elevator ride was amazing. 4 meters a second.
It wasn‚Äôt real clear but nice to check out the promenade & parliament & buildings around it.",
Germany,Rheinturm,Another great tower!,"Definitely go at dusk, for sunset! You will get spectacular view over D√ºsseldorf! Entrance fee is 9 EUR / adult. There‚Äôs also a bar & restaurant at the top should you desire to linger a bit longer.",
Germany,Rheinturm,Lovely activity,"Visiting Cologne and stopped off in Dusseldorf for a day trip. Entry is reasonably priced and they have discount for students. They have a good bar / cafe at the top with cake, donuts, nibbles and nice drinks etc. The view is really great. Worth a visit if you can spare an hour give or take.","Written February 18, 2019"
Germany,Rheinturm,Awesome view,Absolutely stunning views of the city even though the weather wasn't great. It costs ‚Ç¨9 for an adult but you can stay for as long as you want. There is a nice bar/cafe and we stayed for a couple of hours had a beer and admired the view. It's a lovely relaxing way to see the city even if like me you are not good with heights!,"Written February 6, 2019"
Germany,Rheinturm,"Even in winter, it's worth a visit","We took a walk down to the Reinturm and even though the weather was poor, the views from tower are outstanding. Buy a beer or a coffee and watch the boats glide by on the river below you. A relaxing and peaceful way to see a D√ºsseldorf and the hinterland at your pace. Highly recommended.","Written January 28, 2019"

Germany,Rheinturm,View,The view from the top is awesome. It‚Äôs not super expensive so definitely go there. You could even see Cologne in a good weather.,"Written January 4, 2019"
Germany,Rheinturm,Go before 11am,"Must do in D√ºsseldorf take a stroll down the Rhine to end up here. The views are wonderful and if you can get a seat it‚Äôs a really nice way to while away an hour or two with a drink. Didn‚Äôt take long at all to get up, however the line to get down was quite long. Try and get a table near the exit lift so you can jump in the queue when you notice the line has dropped, plus your right next to a bar there too!",
Germany,Rheinturm,A must do location,Don't miss out on the aerial view of the city with the twists and turns of the Rhine. Magic. only 9 euros for an adult with concessions for minors and over 65's. Good bar facilities at the top with restaurant.,"Written January 4, 2019"
Germany,Rheinturm,Pleasantly surprised,"Wandered in off the street when in Mediahafen to find no queues and a ‚Ç¨9 entry for an eye-popping view of the city and the Rhine. I've been to many viewpoints in many cities and for sheer ease, pleasant environment and value this ranks very highly (though perhaps doesn't quite beat Stockholm's Kaknastormet). Decent bar upstairs with just-about-OK priced fare; just beware they want a minimum spend of ‚Ç¨10 on card which isn't displayed anywhere! Main source of pleasure here though is that it doesn't get overcrowded, so you can sit at the ample tables, grab a coffee and enjoy the view for as long as you like!","Written January 3, 2019"
Germany,Rheinturm,Great view,"It's a great view on a sunny day. The views of the Rhein and all the twists and turns amaze me. It's 9 euro to go up but 5 before 11am or after 10 pm and 7 for under 17 and students/seniors. We went during the christmas holiday and it wasn't too bad. The only negative is that upstairs they have a cafe and there are tables in front of all the windows, so it's a bit awkward when it's crowded. It would be nice if they some free windows. You can get a special for cake and coffee with admission, but we didn't do that. Also, apparently you can book online and skip all the lines.","Written January 1, 2019"
Germany,Rheinturm,Great views but overpriced,"Definitely worth doing but at 9 euros a head it was expensive - shame they don't offer a family discount. The views are incredible with landmarks written on the glass so you know what you are looking at. We visited at night and would go again in the day on our next trip to Dussledorf but I would imagine it's at it's best on a clear day. Drinks from the bar, although nice, were very expensive; 2 cocktails, a beer and a hot chocolate 37 euros!","Written December 31, 2018"
Germany,Rheinturm,"Brilliant, A Must For D√ºsseldorf","The admission price was not about at all for the experience. We each paid ‚Ç¨7 because we got student discount but as adults it‚Äôs only ‚Ç¨9 and to go all the way to the top of Rhein Tower and see the views you wouldn‚Äôt get anywhere else was phenomenal. It was definitely value for money. You had no cap on how long you could be there for and we were there for a few hours just admiring the views and relaxing. The drinks were lovely and not bad prices considering where you were, around ‚Ç¨4.50 for a homemade lemonade which was lovely. Whilst we didn‚Äôt have food those who I saw around us seemed to love it. It is definitely a must do attraction if you are in D√ºsseldorf. Finally I would like to say the staff were phenomenal and really friendly and even able to speak English to us which was a huge bonus.","Written December 20, 2018"

Germany,Rheinturm,Its very high and so is the price for the what you get,"I like views, especially from a vantage point high up. This is good for getting views around the city and area. However, for what you get, which is basically an enclosed platform at 168 metres in the air with bar and bar snacks extra, I think the price is a little high.

Germany,Rheinturm,Great view but dirty environment with unfriendly staff,"We decided to go up the tower to see the views whilst enjoying a drink. The man in the kiosk was unsmiling as he took our money, when we wanted to pay by card this was met with a sigh and a grunt. There was a man to take you up in the lift, who was similarly charmless and couldn't manage a friendly greeting, merely telling us we needed to wait on the seats. On arrival at the viewing platform it was busy but not packed, however in the empty tables went uncleared for sometime and even when they were they were not wiped so were left grubby and sticky. The bartender had clearly been to the same school of customer service as his two other colleagues, no smile and only talking to say that cards can only be used to pay for amounts over 10 Euro.

All in all the view in great but the environment itself not particularly nice.","Written December 5, 2018"

Germany,Rheinturm,"Stunning views, but go early","TV towers like this exist all over Germany and are always fun to visit. Views are stunning and the cafe at the top isn't unduly expensive. It's a good idea to visit before 11.00 - you save a lot on the admission price and might miss the coach parties too, giving yourself more time and space to enjoy the amazing views. I'm guessing only the restaurant revolves as the cafe and viewing area at the top don't seem to. Restaurant looked a little pricey but I'm sure it would be a great place for a romantic meal or a special treat.","Written December 1, 2018"

The adult admission fee is most reasonable (certainly when compared to some other similar attractions around the world).

There are also static binoculars which you can use to look alot further into the distance. (For example on a perfectly clear and cloudless day you can see Koln which is almost 30 miles away!) Also on this floor there is a bar were you can get a drink and something light to eat. If you're looking for more of a sit down meal then if you go upstairs there is a restaurant which will be open in September 2018.

We had cheesecake which is ""normal"" flavour (???) and when asked if the Cherry tarte had any dairy the waitress had no idea and was willing to not give any cake even though I'd paid for the ""coffee and cake combo"". Poor service.

Entrance is pricey, but if you buy the ""coffee and cake"" offer it's almost worth it (12.5E each) If you're going for this offer, try not to go late in the afternoon because there is limited cake available and it isn't what's advertised on their offer menu.
We had cheesecake which is ""normal"" flavour (???) and when asked if the Cherry tarte had any dairy the waitress had no idea and was willing to not give any cake even though I'd paid for the ""coffee and cake combo"". Poor service.

There's only one elevator, so you spend a lot of time waiting to go up or down. Although it looks big, you can walk around and see the whole panorama in less than a minute. There are tables all around the views so you'll often have people standing next to you taking photos whilst your eating.",

Germany,Rheinturm,Lovely View over the Rhine,"The lovely feature of this observation tower is that is right next to the Rhine, affording a lovely view not just over the city, but also on the bending river. Of course, the view is not particularly scenic (hence not 5 stars), as Dusseldorf does not offer specially aesthetically pleasing sights and the whole landscape around is completely flat. The view is, therefore, more about the Rhine and how it bends around some industrial complexes in the distance. There is a cafe on top, which is decently priced and with comfortable chairs dotted all around the panorama platform, allowing viewers to sit and watch in the direction they prefer. If you happen to be in Dusseldorf, this one seems the most appealing attraction (the other one being the Heinrich Heine Museum, which we did not visit though).",
Germany,Rheinturm,Impressive in a dirty vicinity area,"I would like to rate it with 5 stars due to its impressive height and excellent top view during a sky clear day, which is like a flying at 168m (550ft) altitude ground level. However entrance ticket is expensive 9‚Ç¨ adults and 7‚Ç¨ children (6-17 years old) except for special offers at groups or disabled or young kids. It is not a museum with exhibitions, just an offering view. In addition the adjacent ground area just outside in the tower base was dirty with a lot of cigarette butts and we also saw some dog poos in the grass and pavement. That's why my total rating is 3 stars.",

No space to take your time and take a glimpse of the view. The whole viewing point has tabels and chairs next to the windows so if there are people how sit there you are in bad luck. I visited multiple high viewing points all over the world ( the one tower in NYC, Petronas In Kuala Lumpur to give you an impression) and I am really disappointed in how the rheinturn divided the space. Never have I seen this and I don't like it at all. The purpose of the tower is to watch the city, not to hang over tables of other people to get a glimpse of the city.

Plus the restaurant has a rotating floor so you don‚Äôt miss out on great pictures,
Germany,Rheinturm,Very good view of the city,"Took the lift to 168m and arrived in a circular overview of the city with a very good coffee shop to stay and enjoy the view. You can see also the nearby MedienHafen, with it's interesting architecture.
There is also a restaurant at the upper floor of the coffee shop, but we didn't go as the cafe was enough for the visit.",

Germany,Rheinturm,Beautiful View of Dusseldorf and the Rhine,"The Rhine Tower offers a bar, restaurant and view of the entire Dusseldorf area and the Rhine.

Germany,Rheinturm,Best at night,"Worth while seeing at night, the tower closes at 1am, there are less people (avoid the crowds), bar is still open and the city (including the Rhine) is lit up, definitely worth while and even worth taking a nice stroll along the Rhine (city is considerably safe)","Written October 17, 2017"
Germany,Rheinturm,Good View at Night,"We came to visit Frank Gehry's work and happened to pass by the Rhine Tower at night. It lights up at night. Good view from afar at the promenade or close by at the foot of it.

If you are interested in architecture, especially Frank Gehry's work, it is worth it to make a trip over and come close to the tower. Otherwise, the view of it from promenade is good enough (in my opinion).

There is a bus that takes one directly from old town to Frank Gehry's site. Bus fare is 2.70 euros or free with D√ºsseldorf pass.","Written October 12, 2017"

Germany,Rheinturm,Dusseldorf's must-visit attraction,"The lift brings you up 168 meters or even more if you want to go to the restaurant (we skipped on it). The views are amazing, although it is almost impossible to take pictures at night time as windows reflect the bar's lights. You can see the whole city of Dusseldorf, including the airport and we watched several plains land there. Very good experience!","Written October 2, 2017"

A pint of lager is around 5 euros at least","Written October 2, 2017"
Germany,Rheinturm,Definitely worth the visit,"The entrance cost can sound a bit dear (10 EUR for the elevator fee), but it is definitely worth it. Upon arrival at the top of the tower (168m above ground), one has a 360¬∞ view of D√ºsseldorf city and surroundings. K√∂ln and other cities can be seen. There is a caf√© on top of the tower too, but I found the options a bit overpriced. Worth the visit for the view, though.","Written September 27, 2017"

Fabulous views from the top & interesting to see a 360 degree view of D√ºsseldorf from the heights!

I didn't try the restaurant or bar so can't comment on that.

Germany,Rheinturm,Not much to do but good views of the city.,Great 360 degree views of the city. A small cafe and restaurant up top so you can grab a coffee and check out the different views. I liked that there are little pointers around the tower that show you what is in a given direction. Not much to do other than that so it will probably be a quick trip.,"Written September 17, 2017"
Germany,Rheinturm,Must see in D√ºsseldorf,"Since this city is small is suggested this visit. We had the luck to be there before 11 so the price for the elevator was 5 instead of 9‚Ç¨.
The elevator is very fast and they took us to the 168 floor to the bar in which we had a cappuccino(a bad one and very short) of course pricey (3,50). U have to know that you are not pushed to pay u can just go do some photos and go. At the 180 is the restaurant but we did not go because we read the reviews and they were so so.",

Germany,Rheinturm,Amazing view and brilliant cocktails,"Looking out onto the city and night while drinking botanical gin cocktails is something that you won't forget for a while, such an amazing view! The cocktails are pretty expensive but as you'd expect for nearly 200m from the ground.",
Germany,Rheinturm,A bird's eye view of D√ºsseldorf,"Visitors to D√ºsseldorf should consider going up to the Rheinturm, especially on a clear and sunny day. You would be able to see as far as the towers in Cologne! There is a bar and lounge on the viewing deck at 168 meters.

Entrance is rather pricey (9 Euro for adults, kids 6-17 pay half price, kids below 6 free) but diners who spend > 30 Euro per person receive a 50% refund of their entrance fare.

Germany,Rheinturm,"Nice view, but bring cash!","It's 2017 however they only accept cash here (with no ATM around as it seems), please keep this in mind! Once inside, it's like a trip back to the 80's. The view is nice and you don't feel rushed to enjoy the view and get back down, as there are seats everywhere and you can get a drink (or even eat in the restaurant one level higher, which we didn't).","Written August 27, 2017"
Germany,Rheinturm,Not worth it on a cloudy day,"I have the D√ºsseldorf Card, you get a 2 ‚Ç¨ discount. Since it wasn't a really good day, I decided that paying 7 ‚Ç¨ wasn't worth it.
At this point, not sure if the Card was a good idea either.",

Germany,Rheinturm,Expensive ride up,"They had no student discount, yet with my love for beautiful, far reaching, sights, this was absolutely worth the price. The ride up was accompanied by a lift-operator who had the key, so only he could operate the elevator up to the 168 meter panorama which was truely amazing.

Menu is not big but everyone can find something. Tasty, but not wow - obviously this restaurant makes a focus on the view - not the food.
Service is average - attentive in the beginning and they slowly forget about you in the beginning of the main course. Restaurant is popular but far to be full.

Pricing is not cheap but expected - no complains, you pay for a location. One thing: in the entrance you should pay 9 euro to get up. In the end of the meal you receive a discount of 4.5 euros. The waiters cannot explain why.","Written July 31, 2017"

There are tables situated around the windows however you can sit at them without having to buy drinks from the bar and enjoy the views.

Germany,Aachen Cathedral,Must visit in Aachen,A magnificent ancient cathedral. The highlight of the Aachen city for sure. You must go inside to understand the magnitude of this creation.,
Germany,Aachen Cathedral,An absolutely stunning Cathedral inside and out.,"The cathedral in Aachen in stunning inside and out. It's appearance has evolved constantly over the past 1200 years and was modified a little during WW2 by the Royal Air Force. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site (from 1978) and it really is a place to visit and remember. There is no fee to enter, just a ‚Ç¨1 charge for photography. Mondays it is open 10am to 1pm and the rest of the week from 10am to 5pm (6pm April to December). There is a treasury shop for gifts and books. The decoration inside is beautiful, especially the stunning ceiling of the Octagon. Not much more to say (look at my photos) other than go and visit this splendid 1200 year old building, it is a work of art.",

Germany,Aachen Cathedral,"Beautiful, Historic, and in Fun Area to Explore","The Emperor Charlemagne died in 814 and is buried here. The fact that we can visit his tomb 1200 years later brought us to Aachen and we weren‚Äôt disappointed.

The Cathedral itself is highly worthwhile. The main part is an octagonal room with a gilt ceiling, which is very striking. Charlemagne‚Äôs tomb, in gold, is in an adjacent room with limited access, but is easily viewable from the public areas. The limitation may have been temporary, due to COVID or perhaps a service, but it did not affect our enjoyment of the visit as it was easily seen from where we were standing.

In the past they banned photography, but now you can take pictures for something like 1 Euro. Spend it. It is worth it.

There are many fine decorative elements around the interior and exterior of the Cathedral. They are worth taking a few minutes to look around.

This isn‚Äôt a large attraction as compared to, say, many other European Cathedrals, but the architecture is unique and attractive. The beauty and historical connections are well worth a visit.

Note: The area around the Cathedral is fun. Look especially for all of the creative fountains nearby. About 100 feet away, for example, is the puppet fountain, which is a lot of fun. You‚Äôll know it from the name when you see it. There are many others scattered around the old part of town.","Written August 25, 2021"

It has also a very special history which makes this visit even more worthy. Inside it like magic, you may expect a dark and huge space but it is so much the opposite. It is cosy and bright, full of colours due to the mosaics and windows. The church wasn't like that always, it got its mosaics after the war, when the church was partially destroyed. During the reconstruction of the interior people picked up elements from other famous cathedrals and integrated there.

I am not a church tourism, most of the places where I visit I do not enter the churchs but this one is something special also for people like me. This is not about religion anymore but architecture, history and art.

Germany,Aachen Cathedral,one amazing place,"It took us way longer to get here from Aachen Station than we expected, and the route was certainly not as straght as implied by the map just outside the station. As a result, we did not see as much of the cathedral as we wanted, but it was certainly worth the effort.

The doors were actually closing when we got there. A mass was about to start. Only worshippers allowed in. We decided we were worshippers, and were allowed into what felt at first like a small ante-chapel. Prayer books in hand, seated in the chairs provided, we looked around as we waited for the mass to start.

Dark and quiet, unlike the bigger, showier Cologne Cathedral we had visited the day before, this cathedral felt more intimate, more spiritual, older. Our eyes soon accustomed themselves to the gloom, allowing us to marvel at architectural details, scary statues, ancient pillars. This was a new way to visit churches for us, seated in one place, just looking around, we lapped it all up.

The mass started. We were only just able to keep up with the German. A few locals. A few travelers ike ourselves. Holiness and reverance, the gloom was doing its job. Our eyes continued to wander over pillars, vaults and statuary.

Unfortunately, we could not stay after the mass to explore. we had a train to catch. We used what time we had to check out the exterior, which seemed equally intricate, equally old. It was crammed in, though, between other, more modern buildings, and try as we may we could not get a clear view of the whole. The details, though, were just fine.","Written December 15, 2019"

And that Charles the Great is buried here, in his ""own"" cathedral.
Style and shape, the superb mosaic, the gold and the ornaments reminds of Byzans and San Marco in Venice springs to mind. The spectacular central octagon nave is adorned by a golden dome.

Splendor and grandeur!

Start with the excellent city museum (Centre Charlemagne) prior to visiting the cathedral - gives you a perfect historic and cultural background.

Germany,Aachen Cathedral,An imposing Cathedral,The Cathedral is a place you must definitely visit when in Aachen.

Germany,Aachen Cathedral,Impressive!,"I admit that I was a bit disappointed when I had the first glimpse of the cathedral from the outside. Without having any prior information about it, I just expected it to be huge. The front yard is also small. But It all changed after I carefully check on the architecture and its details. The interior of the cathedral is also very impressive and the rich history behind it just made it more interesting to me!

It is worth a visit and if you have the chance to have a guided tour, do it. Or simply take time to see the details of the church and enjoy the visit. It is anyway one of the UNESCO world heritage sites.

There is a lot of history and royalty in this place! The central part, Palatine chapel, is where German kings and queens were crowned. It is also Charlemagne's final resting place. The cathedral is composed of chapels and part of the Palace of Aachen.

The interior of the cathedral is so impressive wherever you look. You'll see the beautiful mosaic on floors, walls and ceiling, geometric designs, the vaults, the colorful ceilings and paintings plus the lovely stained-glass windows. Some artifacts are also on display.

Please note that you need to pay EUR 1 if you will take pictures! Why not?","Written November 6, 2019"

The building is impressive and over the years it was extended, refurbished , partially rebuilt as the ages and the wars passed over Europe - nonetheless it is just spectacular and definitely a must see.
For those into architecture for sure it will be a very interesting visit - for those into history likewise - my recommendation is to go on a guided tour so you get the most informations upon your visit.
Inside you pay 1 euro for taking pictures. Visiting otherwise is free - like everywhere donations are welcome.
Please mind your clothing, in the end it is place of worship - regardless if you are religious or not pay attention to this detail and show respect when visiting this place.

Germany,Aachen Cathedral,Eye-opening,"The great cultural centre of the empire of Charles the Great - Charlemagne - has an abiding presence in this wonder of a cathedral: modern interpretations of the artwork of Charles‚Äô court (and later) are sensitively in place to allow modern Church services their place: this is no museum, but a building for a Christian community.
At the same time, looking at the chandelier donated by Friedrich Barbarossa or peering up to see the Carolingian imperial throne on its upper storey give a sense of the roots of much of the idea of European identity, and a feeling of how subtly ideas change: lots to ponder.
The Cathedral is not large, but is colourful with the different marble facings and the later mosaics and stained glass, architecturally fascinating and beautiful.
But do book ahead if you want to join the tours that take you to less accessible areas, and try to make time for the treasury, afterwards, with its stunning medieval art connected with the Cathedral.",

Germany,Aachen Cathedral,Centre of an Empire,"If you're anywhere near Aachen then you must do this. Read first about Charlemagne so you understand how important this town was to Europe. From the palace attached to this church Charlemagne formed the first united Europe and that was in about 700. He was an amazing ruler, introducing education and artists to his palace and encouraging all sorts of reforms which we take for granted today but in his time must have seemed very radical. The church is stunning but the most interesting things are upstairs and to see them you must do the guided tour. The tickets can be bought at the treasury which is across the road from the front door of the Cathedral. You need to get in early because they were sold out when we tried to buy them but due to some good luck we were able to join the tour. It was well worth paying for the tour.","Written July 25, 2019"

You have to take a guided tour to be able to see the choir with the shrines and the throne. When you are on the tour you are also allowed to take photos. I took the guided tour For both these reasons. I was a bit disappointed in the tour itself. The other members of the group asked some questions that the guide could not answer. The tour also focuses on the shrines and throne but not on all the other beautiful aspects like the windows and statues

Germany,Aachen Cathedral,Amazing and beautiful,"Although the cathedral's exterior is not so beautiful, the interior is amazing. The ceilings and much of the interior walls are all mosaic. Must have been 1000s and 1000s of man-hours to complete the pictures. Also, this cathedral houses the remains of Charlemange, who united much of central and western Europe during the middle ages. His remains are held in a gilded coffin which sits behind the main alter. The only negative thing I can say is that if you visit during the time when the Christmas market is running, it can be very crowded.","Written January 6, 2019"

Germany,Aachen Cathedral,Once the biggest dome North of the Alps,"Aachen Cathedral was erected on the orders of Charlemagne in AD 796 and was, on completion, in 798, the largest cathedral north of the Alps. It was modelled after the Basilica of San Vitale, in Ravenna, Italy, and was built by Odo of Metz. Charlemagne also desired for the chapel to compete with the Lateran Palace, both in quality and authority. It was originally built in the Carolingian style, including marble covered walls, and mosaic inlay on the dome. On his death, Charlemagne's remains were interred in the cathedral and can be seen there to this day. The cathedral was extended several times in later ages, turning it into a curious and unique mixture of building styles. It is a beautiful building and has a number of treasures to see inside. Allow ~1 1/2 hrs for visit.",

Germany,Aachen Cathedral,A little gem with an amazing history,"This gem of a cathedral is not to be missed! The cathedral is beautiful and its history is amazing. I‚Äôm still getting my head around the fact that Charlemagne commissioned the building of the cathedral and that it was used for the crowning of German kings for almost 600 years, let alone that Charlemagne‚Äôs remains are kept here.

It may not be amongst the largest of cathedrals in Germany, but it is nonetheless impressive. Its history alone would make it so, but its interior is also exquisite. It‚Äôs hardly surprising that it was the first German building to achieve World Heritage Listing.

We were fortunate to have visited Aachen during a week of celebrations to mark 40 years of this listing. This allowed us to view Charlemagne‚Äôs throne (on the first floor) without prior notice, which is apparently required at other times.

During this week, there were also concerts (predominantly choral) held in the cathedral in the evening. These were unfortunately sold out. I don‚Äôt know if they take place at other times of the year. It would be worth investigating, though. I recall seeing choir risers placed around the first floor, so I can imagine the sound floating over the audience below would be quite a beautiful experience.

Visitors to the cathedral are permitted from 11am, after a service at 10.30am, if memory serves me correctly. We weren‚Äôt aware of this, but cathedral staff were very friendly and polite when pointing it out.

I would have liked to have done a guided tour, but circumstance (a 5-year old child) did not permit. There are brochures available for 1 Euro at the entrance that provide information about cathedral highlights, though, which was very useful for providing a brief insight to the historical significance of items.",

Germany,Aachen Cathedral,Where unified Europe began ...,"In this age of Brexit, it is worth remembering that the first unification of Europe began here about 1200 years ago. For this reason, my wife who is an armchair historian wanted to see Charlemagne‚Äôs throne. Also here are Charlemagne‚Äôs remains in a gold casket. To see this, we registered for the guided tour in English, which is conducted daily at 2pm. The guide was very knowledgeable and helpful with questions. A memorable visit. Of particular significance to me was that the guide told us that although Charlemagne was illiterate, he wanted schools in his churches to educate the lay children. Is it this that led to the universities of Europe that made it the most powerful geoentity of all time, a legacy that crossed the Atlantic to make USA the inheritor of this tradition? As an amateur historian myself of education and higher education it is worth recording that even before Charlemagne‚Äôs educational revolution, the Buddhist tradition in India had schools (hence pallikudams) attached to each Buddhist place of worship (the pallis). Sadly, this was driven out of the Indian subcontinent almost exactly at the same time as Charlemagne must have introduced it into the fledgling Europe of his day.","Written October 5, 2018"

Germany,Aachen Cathedral,The Aachen Dom,"Visited Aachen recently on a coach tour. We had about 4 hours to take in the sights and return to the coach. We headed towards the main square where the magnificent town hall stood. Decorated with figurines on the walls. To see inside was about ‚Ç¨6. There was a lovely fountain in front of the hall. Shops and cafes surrounded the square. We left the square to see what other wonders we could find in our short time. Exhibits and market stalls where scattered around the surrounding streets. We stopped for some food and to by fancy gifts. Has we were sitting I looked up and saw tower with what appeared to be housing pigeons or doves, this place was large.
After eating we followed this alley into a courtyard of some description and the entrance to a church, a big church. We walked to the end of the courtyard to see better it was a cathedral, it was the Aachen Dom. In the courtyard there was a few rooms, shops and a toilet area. To use the toilets it was ‚Ç¨0.50 each., in the gents novel goal posts sat in the urinals. There was a gift shop in the corner of the courtyard with souvenirs for the Dom selling all sorts of items. Just outside the the courtyard was a building also assigned to the Dom where you could pay for guided tours around some of the secluded areas of the Dom prices around ‚Ç¨12. On the side was a room showing a film about the Dom. Entry to the Dom was free however a fee of ‚Ç¨1 was paid to an attendant in the Dom for taking photos. There was a chapel to the left of the entrance for peace and pray. There was also a wedding which was lovely to see. Certainly a good place to visit.","Written July 20, 2018"

Germany,Aachen Cathedral,"Spectacular Chapel - If Possible, Take the Tour","The minute I entered the cathedral I gasped. A rounded nave, brilliantly and minutely decorated, with pillars leading to a beautiful dome, and beyond that, in the area around the altar more of the decor along with deep red stained-glass windows, and golden treasures that dazzle. I won't say I've never seen anything like it, as I've been to Ravenna, but in my estimation the Aachen chapel is closer to the Alhambra, obviously excepting the differences prescribed by religion - no human figures in the Alhambra palaces - but in both a richness and detail almost everywhere one looks.

If you get a chance, take the tour. There is only one English language tour a day (forgetting right now if it is 2 pm or 3 pm), but that wasn't convenient for me, so I joined a German-language tour - these leave at least hourly, if I remember correctly. While I understood very few of the guide's words, the tour took me upstairs, which is not available to visitors who have not joined a tour.

What is there? More beauty, and a much better look at the dome, as well as the plainest sight in the whole chapel, Charlemagne's throne. for me it was more than worth the little money I paid. Tour or not, this is a stunner. It was a dreary, rainy day on my visit, so I saw little of the old town, but this sight is worth the trip in itself.",

Germany,Aachen Cathedral,Marvellous.,"The Aachen Cathedral (Aachener Dom) is the episcopal church of Aachen and dates back to the Charlemagne era, in which it was part of the original Aachen royal palace.
The central octagonal part, which now functions as the nave of the church, was built at the end of the 8th century in Byzantine style.
Charlemagne was buried here in 814.
The original church was enlarged with a gothic choir hall and a two-piece Capella vitrea (glass chapel) in the 14th century. During the following centuries, the dome, a number of chapels and the tower were added to the structure.
If you are in Aachen, the cathedral is definitely a must see.

Scribbles on the marble pieces of the Charlemagne throne say something about the origin of the piece. Something you can't gather on your own or even the internet. They'll also tell you that most of the finishing you see now is modern rather than medieval. I saw certain similarities between the marble claddings and the ceiling mosaics here with Hagia Sophia but unfortunately was disappointed to know they were installed in the 1800s or early 1900s by craftsmen who went to the east to learn the arts.

Germany,Zugspitze,Tips for getting there from Garmisch.,"A cool experience and one of the highlights of a trip to Garmisch. ‚Ç¨61 per person for the train trip from GaPa is of course expensive - a possibility to save is to drive to Eibsee and buy tickets up from there.

I found the English instructions and map on the flyer a bit unclear, so here's the way to do it: Take the train from GaPa all the way up to the Gletscher (glacier) plateau, do not get off at Eibsee where many do. (Exception: If you don't like tunnels). From the glacier (which has some sights / often better visibility than the very top) take the cable car up to the summit. For the way down, take the other way: Cable car down to Eibsee and from there the train back to GaPa.

Of you found my review helpful I would appreciate your vote","Written September 20, 2021"
Germany,Zugspitze,"A great experience, if not the cheapest. If you have car, try Eibsee. Dog friendly.","If you get a decent day this is a great experience; the cable car ride is breathtaking with the world‚Äôs biggest cable span between towers, and there‚Äôs plenty to do at the summit including walking the glacier. And some reasonable food options (the one down at the glacier station was a lot less crowded).

Having read the reviews about the queues in Garmisch and then the lengthy train ride, I took the car up to Eibsee and parked there. Electronic signposts as you leave Garmisch tell you whether there are free spaces at Eibsee, helping to avoid a wasted trip, but the catch is that the parking there adds another ‚Ç¨18 to the cost. A mile or so back down the road there‚Äôs a small free car park, if you arrive early enough to get a space and are prepared to slog up the last mile, and for the exceptionally early or very lucky there‚Äôs free parking in a small lay-by within half a mile.

I took the cable car from Eibsee both ways - there were no queues at all (total ticket numbers are currently covid restricted and most people start from Garmisch) and we were up on the mountaintop within fifteen minutes of parking. I saw the cog railway come into Eibsee when we were leaving; it‚Äôs an attractive little train and a marvel of engineering, but the ride up the mountain is basically half an hour in a tunnel - how interesting can that be?

The cable car ride is such an experience that I was happy to ride it both up and down. Plenty of people took their dogs up, and mine had a great time running about in the snow. The were a couple of areas off limits to dogs, and we couldn‚Äôt do the toboggan rides (nor the rope climb to the actual summit, which wouldn‚Äôt have been safe with a leashed dog - it looked a scrum to get there and back in any event) but overall I‚Äôd rate it a good dog friendly experience.

Germany,Zugspitze,Think twice before visiting from Munich!,"You‚Äôll spend about 8-10 hours traveling or standing in line for about 2 hours worth of experience. It is incredible at the top and, at times, worth the travel - but, it was a very, very long day. Also, way too many people for what capacity the transportation allowed!

To get an idea‚Ä¶ the train from Munich to GaPa is about 2 hours, then the line to turn your zugspitze reservation into a ticket is about 1.5 hours, then the wait for the cogwheel train was about 1.5 hours. That was all to get to Lake Ebisbee when you then take the gondola up to zugspitze. To get down on the gondola we waited about 1.5 hours, then another hour wait to get back into the cogwheel train, then the 2 hour train ride back to Munich. Long day of travel for beautiful views!!!","Written August 26, 2021"
Germany,Zugspitze,Must visit the Top of Germany - Breathtaking views,An amazing experience going up the top of Germany - Zugspitze. We took the cable car round way i.e. going up and down. You can also take the cog wheel train while coming down. They are both great experiences and the place offers breathtaking views. Recommended time is 2 hours. Always visit on the clear day so that you can have a look at 4 countries from the top. Also do not forget to explore Lake Ebsee when coming down. You can book the cable car even 2-3 days advance.,"Written August 15, 2021"

Germany,Zugspitze,Fun day with kids.,"Visited with our two young boys in July 2019 and highly recommend. We caught the first cable car of the morning (only 2 other passengers) and had the run of the mountain for at least two hours before more visitors started to arrive.

We packed breakfast which was fortuitous as the restaurants were not open when we first arrived.

The ride up was beautiful (and a tiny bit stressful watching a 7 year old stand on the floor window of the cable car :-).

The engineering is nothing short of fascinating.

Once at the top we explored the connecting tunnel to Austria - a fun history lesson, and the little museum.

After wandering at the top a bit we took the small gondola down into the bowl and the boys took to the sledding area. Free sleds for use on a reasonable sized hill. They also enjoyed exploring the rocky area around the chapel.

We considered a short hike but decided against due to our boys ages, the terrain and not having our typical hiking gear. Later that morning an experienced hiker fell and died. All to say - it‚Äôs a mountain with rough terrain - come prepared if you plan to wander.

Also, wear layers - as with most mountain forays, we were in coats and pants to start and shorts and tees by the afternoon.

I recommend and would do it again if in the area.",

Germany,Zugspitze,Hotspot in Germany,"The highest point (2962 meter) and for sure under the top 10 in Germany.
For a family a bit too expensive. For 2 adults and 2 kids you must pay around 170 USD. For this you can go up and down one time. You can take any kind of transport like the new cable car (2017) or the train. Beware it can be cold in summer (5 degrees). So bring a warm jacket. And book in advance because many tourists want to go up. It‚Äôs definitely a must to visit.","Written July 9, 2020"
Germany,Zugspitze,"On the top of Germany - expensive, many tourists - but still worth it!","Of course, such an attraction is an attraction for tourists from all over the world, and 48 euros for the cable car ride is a lot. Regardless, it's worth it.

The view from Germany's highest mountain (2,962 m / 9,718 ft above sea level; and the highest peak of the Wetterstein Mountains) is impressive. The rough and barren rocky landscape with a view as far as the eye can see - the crystal clear shimmering Eibsee is clearly visible at the foot of the mountain.
However, one should pay attention to the weather forecast and better with a clear view of the mountain without clouds. Unfortunately, the weather forecast is not always 100% correct. That's just the way it is. But also in the clouds - in between - a great experience.
The top station is futuristic and fascinating, almost gives the impression of being somewhere in space.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Beautiful,The place is worth to visit fir both sightseeing and skiing. You can reach the place either by cog-wheel train - directly to the skiing area or the train and then cable car - to the sightseeing area. Both provide comfortable journey. But views via the cable car are much better.,
Germany,Zugspitze,Beautiful,"Highest point in Germany and so worth going up there even if you are not skiing. We went up there in bad weather but it was still an incredible experience, just the ride up the mountain in the gondola is a great experience. You have a small store and a restaurant at the top to warm up in. Views in good condition are magnificent.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Go Skiing- They Charge the same,This is the highest point in Germany. I went up with a family that was skiing. I do not ski. I was charged roughly the same amount just to ride up (48 Euros) which was a bummer. However the scenery was fantastic!! The little lodge/bar up top had a great view and nice beers.,
Germany,Zugspitze,Great skiing!,"We had a great time skiing on the glacier. The snow was fresh and not a lot of people were on the mountain. The ride up is not for the faint hearted since at the end you're riding the enclosed gondola straight up the side of the mountain. The restaurant in the ski area is cafeteria style, so this worked well for our family. The apple strudel was delicious and overall, the price is very affordable so if you're thinking of going to Garmisch, try skiing on the Zugsptize!","Written February 23, 2020"

Had breakfast at the restaurant of top of Germany. Got great photos. Was very windy on the observatory deck. Dress accordingly.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Nice ski area but really poor ski lift system.,"The best parts about this ski area are the large amount of free ride areas, nice view, and ok restaurants but the negative parts are the poor dated ski lifts, the service staff attitude, and the really slow train transport up onto the mountain.",
Germany,Zugspitze,"Snow had fallen, snow in snow, snow on snow...","My son and I were visiting my sister and family at Erlangen. We planned a day-trip to Zugspitze. So, it was my sister, brother-in-law, niece,nephew, my son and me. We were joined by my sister‚Äôs friend, her husband and daughter...
We took the train from Erlangen to N√ºrnberg as early as 7am. We then took the train from N√ºrnberg to M√ºnchen and changed to another train from M√ºnchen to Garmisch-Partenkirchen. After that, we took the cogwheel train from Zugspitzbahnhof to Gletscherbahnhof located at the height of 2,588 metres above sea level.
We walked to the south part of the mountain which is the Zugsitzplatt, a high ‚Äòkarst‚Äô (formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone) plateau with many caves.
Three glaciers, the two largest in Germany namely, Northern Schneeferner and H√∂llentalferner and the third namely, Southern Schneeferner lie on the flanks of Zugspitze.
The highest mountain in Germany, Zugspitze was named after the ‚ÄúZugbahnen‚Äù or avalanche paths down the mountain‚Äôs notoriously steep north face and summit.

Less than two weeks prior to this trip to Zugspitze in the German Alps, my husband, my son and I, had been to two more glaciers, Mt. Titlis and Glacier 3000 in the Swiss Alps. On both occasions, we had met bright, sunny weather.
However, at Zugspitze, there was not the faintest sign of the sun. It felt very different and was indeed a welcome change to have good snowfall instead. It felt more like a Winter Wonderland than any other snow clad peak I have visited and I felt very close to Nature.
We climbed as high up as the Church Maria Heimsuchung, which stands at the height of almost 3000 metres above sea level, defying sun, storm, wind and snow. I felt that this house of God, standing in solitude, like a sentinel in the vast expanse of snow, provides peace and protection to the skiers and winter sports enthusiasts during their visits to the glacier. On enquiring, I learnt that Catholic and Protestant Mass are celebrated on a regular basis depending on weather conditions. I felt deep reverence, not only for the Creator but also for this tiny little place of prayer as I stood high up in the snow clad mighty mountain with snow flakes falling all over us.
The children had put in their snow suits and they paid no heed to the constant drizzle of snowflakes. They were busy swooping down on slides and toboggans; climbing up and sliding down again.
We were constantly alert about making it back in time for the train, but we did not want to miss out on going to the Zugspitze summit.
So, we made a dash for the Gletscherbahn cable car station from where cable cars runs every 10 minutes between the Zugspitz glacier and the summit.
We barely had about 20 minutes to spend at the summit in order to be able to catch the last cable car down. So we rushed out being careful to remain on the German side
It is said that on a clear day, four countries : Germany, Austria, Italy and Switzerland can be seen from the Zugspitze.
However, standing in the Zugspitze platform that offered a 360 degrees view, we looked north, south, east and west; but it was too foggy and musty and there coupled with snowfall, the view was totally obscured and we could see nothing beyond a couple of metres. The only regret I felt was that we could not spot the famous golden summit cross. Given a chance, I would have loved taking a picture standing by its side.
For our return, we took the aerial tram right upto Garmisch-Partenkirchen and trains to M√ºnchen, N√ºrnberg and Erlangen respectively.",

Germany,Zugspitze,Wonderful day,"We took the train from Munich and purchased tickets for the cable car/train up to the Zugspitze after we arrived. Our whole experience was excellent with the exception of the man selling tickets and the woman in the office. They were both very rude. She used profanity in describing how busy the restaurants would be since it was New Year‚Äôs Day and a ski jumping competition was taking place that day. It is unfortunate that those two unhappy employees are the face of the operation.

The cable car rides were very scenic. Try to go on a clear day. We were blessed with beautiful weather and lovely views. We did not purchase food at the top. Be sure to take the cable car down to the ski area.","Written January 14, 2020"
Germany,Zugspitze,"Great Skiing, worth a visit","We had an exceptionally good day on our visit, to the top of Germany. However we went by train, and this journey takes 90 minutes.

The runs are quite short, but the weather and snow conditions were perfect.

Germany,Zugspitze,A must go on a sunny day,"With the new cable car the trip is below 20 minutes to the top (unless there are queues). There is an observation deck and a chance to walk over to the Austrian side. Views from up there are unbeatable. In Winter the skiing is also very decent for a day and in autumn e enjoyed some sledging, when snow is not seen elsewhere.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Top of Germany,"We visited Zugspitze on Christmas Eve and it was snowing while we were there.

Germany,Zugspitze,Breathtaking,"Wow, what an amazing place. You start by riding a cable car that takes you to the top of the mountain. Yes tickets are a bit expensive (40 Euros) but it is worth the money. The view from the top is stunning. It is a bit windy and can be cold during the winter times but you can easily warm up inside the restaurant. While at the top you will see people skiing and snowboarding. The recreational area is massive, I've never seen anything like it. If you are into skiing or snowboarding I would recommend to visit this place and have the time of your life. If you have a fear of heights, you may have some issues during the cable car ride.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Amazing place,One of the must seen places in germany. My advice is to go early around 8 am to enjoy the day at the top. Go directly to the top of zugspitze using the cable car for ascending. At the top you enjoy the view and have some photos. One hour is enough for the top. Then use the short cable car to descend to the flat part ( glatcher) where you can spend the whole day in skiing or enjoying playing with snowboard. Restaurants and rent of skiing materials are both available. You may use the train at the end of the day to go back to to trainstation or parking. Cable car after sunset is non valuable is its totally dark you cant see any thing.,"Written January 1, 2020"
Germany,Zugspitze,Could Not Believe It,"The mountain itself is stunning. The day was windy, a bit uncomfortable in that way. Otherwise a beautiful day. The unbelievable part was the amount of people using the mountain for recreation. It was my third time to visit. First time was 1975, there weren't half-dozen people skiing. The second time was 2009--small resturant, a few skiiers--mostly site seers. By December 2019--couldn't believe my eyes. Skiiers abound, nice size resturant plus a bar added to the grounds, sleigh riding, and the lovely ski chalets at the base of the mountain.

Germany,Zugspitze,My teenager even said ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù,"We took a day trip to Zugspitze... through Germany side, even though we were staying in Austria. We wore snow boots, snow jackets, snow gloves & layered clothing. It was very cold, but since we read about it ahead of time, we were dressed perfectly.

For our family of 4, it cost 129 Euro for ascent & descent. We took the cable car on the way up. There are about 50 people standing up for the ride. We were close to the side, so we had clear view out the glass side. It wasn‚Äôt very shaky, except when you got through this one power pole (I don‚Äôt know what it was), it sways a bit. Every single person went ‚ÄúWhoa...‚Äù and then we all chuckled.

We went outside to the ‚Äúpatio‚Äù area and the views seriously take your breath away!!! Luckily we had a clear day that we could see out & sure enough, we saw clouds below the mountain tops. We went through all the areas and lookout points. Make sure to wear warm clothing because it was -10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees F for us Americans!).

***Since we went through the Germany side, the cable car to the glacier was included in the price.***

We did not think our skiing skills were good enough to ski here, even though we have skied 3 days in Austria. Once we were here, we saw that it would of been ok for my teenager & husband... I‚Äôm still too much of a chicken. LOL

We did not eat anything here even though the food looked good.

Well thought out, fantastic cable car - one from Germany has I believe the longest free standing portion of a cable car in the world) and one from Austria. At the top, you can spend hours, you can also, if you're nuts, scramble up to the summit, which has two flimsy ropes preventing you from sliding to your death....if you are into that stuff...but the platforms, history, pictures were awesome. We managed to time our visit to a day where it was crystal clear and man, what a sight. We took the railroad to the cog railroad to the ZugspitzBahn, and the entire experience was sensational. Just so you know, if you take Geman rail to Garmisch Partenkirchen, as you leave the train, within the station, you'll see signs for the Seilbahn Zugspitze; just follow them. The Zugspitze railway is literally right next door to the Garmisch Partenkirchen railroad station, buy your tickets, the train leaves every 30 min. It only goes in one direction. There are then two stops...one in Grainau, I believe, where you switch to the cog railway (which is no great shakes; just a unique experience but still pretty level ground) and then it takes you to the Cable Car station - Seilbahn Zubspitze - and that alone is a fantastic experience. it's very new, very safe, very well run. The cable car gondola actually has a small glass window...in the floor! I'd have to double check, but I think the whole thing is more than 6000 feet. -- here's a quote from the website - "" ently holds the world record for the longest freespan in a cable car at 3,213 metres (10,541 ft). Construction of the system began in 2015 and it opened on 22 December 2017."" All very well coordinated, and a wonderful way to spend most of a day. One of the highlights of our trip.",
Germany,Zugspitze,"Great view, but super crowded in summer","My husband had been here many years ago and thought it might be interesting to go back. Granted we went in August, which meant it was super crowded - in the trains on the way from Garmisch, on the cable cars up and down, and especially at the buildings where food and beer are served. It was so packed, we could hardly walk around on the deck to enjoy the views. It was also quite expensive for what it was. The views are great and we can say we've done it, but we have no interest in going back. If you've never been to the top of a mountain range it might be worth the money and crowds, but otherwise I'd skip it.","Written October 25, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,"Highest in Germany, awesome cogwheel train ride","We parked our car at the Eibsee station, we'r supposed to take the cable car up but it's under maintenance so we just ride a 40min cogwheel train up to glacier park for eur56/pax RT, explored snowy park, it's church, experienced snow sled, snow walking, had lunch at Gletscherrestaurant Sonnalpin, reasonable price, drink beer, tasty curry sausages but awful breaded chicken, eaten half the not so good blueberry cake, we seated outside were lots of birds waiting to steal our food. I fed them the awful breaded chicken. You wont be allowed to seat on the outside bar sitting of Zugspitzeplat the waiter would call u out unless you order beer from them. Super cold when the wind blows. We didnt go up to the summit though as its always covered in thick clouds. I highly recommend you visiting this place.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Always a wonder!,"This time it was snowing heavily at the top, which gave a different, beautiful perspective of this wonderous site. Whether there are clear views or clouds, you will take away the beauty of, not only the summit, but the train/cable car trip to the top and back down. The views are phenomenal from bottom to top.","Written October 20, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,Fun!,"This is a must-see and not difficult to find from Munich. Ride the cable car up and down, the cog railroad does not afford any views! At the top we found a cold snow-covered platform! I could certainly return to the Zugspitze but be advised it is rather costly at 58 euros per person, but worth it!",
Germany,Zugspitze,On the top of Germany,"The hightest mountain in Germany is just on the Austrian border. From both countries there is an easy access with cable cars and the top is devided between the two countries. The new German cable car is the longest and highest in Europe.

Restaurant in the German side is more modern but both are good.

On a beautiful weather the views are stunning and you can also visit the deminising glacier for a brisk walk.","Written October 16, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,"Go, even if the day isn't crystal clear","My fiancee and I went here because we couldn't pass up going to the tallest mountain in Germany while we were in Munich. $69 per person buys a combination ticket for a roundtrip on the DB (mainline) train from Munich to Garmisch, the cog railway to just below the peak, and the cable car to the peak. All without any climbing, unless you want to.

While the weather wasn't clear on the day we went, we still had impressive views from the peak and on the rides to and from the peak. It was fun to see so much snow on an otherwise 50-degree (F) day. It was also fun to eat lunch seated comfortably at table while looking through windows at the mountain panorama around us. If you change between the cable car and cog railway at Eibsee, take the opportunity for a short walk to the lake.","Written October 15, 2019"

Germany,Zugspitze,A Must See!!!,I had little expectations on what to expect here but ended up being an absolute highlight. We were fortunate to have a clear day so when up the top we had amazing views. Everything from the train ride through the hills & seeing the local homes with their flower box balconies to the impressive cable car experience. Allow a good 5 hours to fully experience Zugspitze. We loved every minute ... if you leave at the end of the day be prepared to line up for the train.,
Germany,Zugspitze,"Expensive, but worth it.","60 Euro for a roundtrip ticket on the cable car and/or cog train to the summit of the Zugspitze. Worth the view. Dress warmly as it is windy up there. Ticket price does not include a separate cable car to the glacier, but you can purchase a combination ticket. The restaurants at the top offer a good selection and good views, but are pricey. Weekends and holidays see long lines to get up or down from the mountain at any time of year, so either go during the week, or plan to be there early in the morning.","Written October 11, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,Beautiful !!!,"This was my second trip to the Zugspitze and it turned out to be the perfect day for a visit. Clear blue skies made viewing all of the surrounding mountains spectacular.
We opted for the train and the cable car up and the faster cable car ride down to the Eibsee Lake and then train back to the station.
Views were just beautiful. The weather was perfect to sit and enjoy a pretzel & a beer at the restaurant.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Wowza!,"We lucked out on a beautiful, clear fall day to visit the top of the Zugspitze. The train from Garmisch and the cable car from the Elbsee were half the fun. The views from the top were, of course spectacular too! We were disappointed that the restaurant/bar was closed when we got there, but managed to survive without beer somehow. The cogwheel train down the mountain was also fascinating and we couldn't believe the angle at which it descended and the engineering that must have gone into it. If you have a bad back, I suggest fighting for a seat, as the long trip down the mountain trying to stand up straight for that long can be straining. Lots of fun all around!","Written October 9, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,Tallest Beer Garten,Tallest Beer Garten and great food! The views are amazing and we got to explore around the top! Best way to be in two countries at once between Germany and Austria!,
Germany,Zugspitze,Great adventure on top,"We visited Zugspitze with my family in ate May. The weather was fair, we had a few sunny hours. We took the first cogwheel train uphill, chilled out at the h√ºtte, then ascended to the top with the cabin lift. At the top we walked around, had some great food, and before the dark clouds covered the top we descended with the new cabin lift. For those afraid of heights this can sometimes be a challenge, but the overall experience was great.","Written October 6, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,The Top of Germany is a MUST-SEE--if the Weather is Clear,"We were daytrippers from Munich and arrived just about noon.
It's an easy walk from the DB rail station over to the Zugspitze station. The round trip is expensive (58 eur) but it‚Äôs worth it. You take the small train for a few stops, then transfer to the even smaller cog railway car. Up, Up. Up! you chug until you reach an alpine lake village. From here you can exit and take the shiny new gondola up the mountain and arrive in 10 minutes, or (as we did), stay on the cog railway to the base station. Beware.. the last half of the way up the mountain is underground. If you are claustrophobic, it might not be for you.
From the train station, you can explore the glacier, hike, take a little toboggan ride, or in season set off on your ski adventure. A short gondola ride whisks you to the top (all included in your ticket) Enjoy the summit. Visit Austria. Grab a bite to eat--check out the museum on the Austrian side. hike to the summit (if you dare).

I‚Äôd suggest returning to the lake town via the big gondola‚Äî squeeze to the front for an amazing view.

The Zugspitz is a great way to spend the day.","Written October 3, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,Amazing views,"Train ride to the top was crowded but the weather was perfect the day I was there so I guess many people had the same idea to go that day. Train ride took a couple of hours both ways and wasn‚Äôt much to see as most of your time is in a tunnel, but the ride is absolutely worth it. You will have to take a lift from the glacier to the summit as the train doesn‚Äôt go all the way to the peak. They have fantastic Bratwurst at the top also.",

Germany,Zugspitze,It‚Äôs All About The Weather,"We managed to go up on a day where we could see for miles and miles. It was definitely worth the money spent on the transportation up and back. But had we waited a day, we probably would have skipped because of the rain, haze, etc.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Stunning!,"We drove to the Gondola and took it up.
Fantastic and terrifying as there is only one tower. Arriving at the top there is still snow.
Great views in all directions. About 10 Celsius cooler. Had hot chocolate. There is a modern restaurant. We took a different gondola down to the ski resort/glacier. They had sleds that you could use on the snow for free. We then rode from there back to the Parking lot on the cogwheel train. It is a fairly large train. The first 50 percent plus is in a tunnel. Then through a beautiful alpine environment.
The ticket for all 3 was 54 euro. If no car you get on the train in Garmisch.
I would highly recommend visiting here on clear day.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Top of the World Feeling!,"We loved our visit here, and it truly capped off our visit to southern Germany. We purchased the 'Garmisch Summer Ticket' (avail thru Aug 14th) that included RT all day trains from Munich to Garmisch, cogwheel train to the 'Zugspitzeplatz', and cable car rides up/down (free with Garmisch Summer Ticket). Best Gondala ride we've ever been on, with amazing views of not only lake Elbsee but the steep cliff face of the spitze (there is even a clear glass portion of the floor too!). On top, the food in the restaurant is restaurant quality if not pricey but serves its purpose well. Your GST also enables unlimited free cable car rides via the 'Gletscherbahn' to an open area for walking around or relaxing in chairs while enjoying draft beers and coffee (life is good here!) and more spectacular views. Back at the Zugspitze, outdoor viewing areas abound, along with bratwurst and walkup coffee/beer stands. Take the walkway over to Austria (really!) for photo opportunities and more one of a kind views. Gets a little busy in the afternoons, but this place was definitely a 'bucket list' item for us and not to be missed!",
Germany,Zugspitze,It never ceases to amaze me.,"I've been visiting it every couple years for the last 62 years. I've watched the hotel and ski lodge develop over the years. Winter or summer, it is without a doubt one of the most beautiful sites in Europe.","Written September 23, 2019"

Well organized and staff friendly everywhere. Super Clean far better them on the shared mountaintop German side...

Cable Cars are frequent - If I remember correctly every 20min.

Good museums and technical details shown at top station and valley station.
All Free when you use the cable car.",

Germany,Zugspitze,An Awesome Alpine Adventure,"We attended with our six year old and the experience was great. Beautiful views, not too crowded (probably because of the weather forecast), great food and service and everything was clean. We chose to ride up with the cable car and then later take the train down to Grainau. Both trips were well worth it. The cafeteria-style restaurant close to the glacier is excellent with very reasonable prices, lots of room, excellent food and generous portions. The staff were also top notch. If you are in the area, you need to go here.

For some reason, tripadvisor thinks this is a shop...it is not. It is a tourist attraction.","Written September 10, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,OMG! An absolute must!!!,"To say this was a ""priceless adventure"" is a minor statement!!! I am a skier, and have skied both the Canadian and US Rockies. We made our summer venture up the Zugspitze via cog railway thru the mountains, then tram up. The views were spectacular!

Germany,Zugspitze,Top of Germany,We took the cable car to the top. A beautiful 360 degree views with snow capped mountains all around. It was a bit chilly as it was slightly overcast but still amazing to see.,
Germany,Zugspitze,Amazing views and must visit location,"If ones in the vicinity - South Germany, this is a must visit. Its not cheap but still not as expensive as the Swiss mountains. There is a train car which has rack and pinion tracks due to inclination which is a charm for all those who are interested in trains.

It can be done as a day trip, accessible from both German and Austrian sides but like I said the German side offers rack n' pinion train!

The views are stunning both on the way and from the top. One has to experience the winds to believe how strong they are.

There is demarcated border on the mountain top - so can can visit Austria while you are there :)",
Germany,Zugspitze,Europe trip,"I had to go for at least one day trip for Zugspitze, the top of Germany as I am a nature lover . When I experienced the place then I felt that my trip would be incomplete without seeing that spot . Words will be less to describe what I experienced .",

Germany,Zugspitze,unforgettable adventure,"You just have to be there. Great experiences, wonderful views and landscape. Kids can go sledding in the middle of summer. It is possible to enter just to reach the spire, but it requires some skill and courage - a lumbering person, not to tell the obese I advise against this stage of the trip. A bit dangerous, but without it it wouldn't be so exciting.",
Germany,Zugspitze,A trip to the top of Germany‚Äôs highest mountain,"We visited Zugspitze, Germany‚Äôs highest mountain at 2900 metres +. We used the cable car(58euros per adult) which was quick with beautiful views. You could also us the cog railway but I understand a large part of the journey is in a tunnel. Views from the top are spectacular. Part of the viewing platform is in Austria. If you wished, you could go down into Austria on a different cable car.",
Germany,Zugspitze,You just have to make this the reason for coming here,"Grey clouds in Garmisch-Partenkirchen did not mean that was as well. Bright sunshine and fantastic views when we arrived. Must be one of the most photograph places in Germany.
Restaurants and plenty of seating inside and out.

Germany,Zugspitze,At the top with amazing views,"A definite must see, despite the crowds. The views are amazing and the trip with the Zugspitz Seilbahn from Eibsee is a highlight especially when going with younger children. My older children want to come back and hike up up to the top the next time. In hindsight I would consider taking the cogwheel train to the Zugspitz Platt and then make the hike up to the summit taking the Eibsee cable car back down.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Breathtaking! A must see!,Well worth the trip. It was our first time in the Bavarian Alps and to see it from the top of the mountain was unbelievable. It is so hard to describe and is a must see in person. We took the cable car up to the top and stayed for about 3 hours. We had the best afternoon and to see the Alps from different angles was magnificent.,"Written August 22, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,Steepest Cable Car,"As we drove up to the location we looked up and noticed just how steep the cable car was. Wow! I would never have thought a cable car could achieve such a vertical incline, but it did - and with ease. The car fits 120 people and part of the floor is glass (not for the faint hearted). The ride up the mountain on cable car was smooth. The very top of the mountain was lovely but not a lot to do except for look out at the beautiful view. We then took the smaller cable car to the next mountain. I found this mountain more pleasurable as there was more to do. Kids could toboggan down part of the mountain and there were smaller walks around the mountain. We then took the cog wheel train back down the mountain and this was also a lovely ride with a view. If heights don‚Äôt bother you, this mountain is a great option on a good day.","Written August 20, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,Excellent mountain trip with good views,"We visited on a warm summer day that was sunny and clear. The experience might be very different if the weather wasn‚Äôt as good. We ascended using the rack railway to Zugspitzplatt, taking the first morning train, where we stopped for a look around the plateau/glacier area. The train was operated in two sections. The train from Garmisch-Partenkirchen terminated at Grainau, where the passengers transferred to another train for the steep rack railway up to the Zugspitzplatt. Even the early train was pretty busy.

The Zugspitzplatt area is worth visiting: there are cafes and a chapel, displays about the mountain and tobogganing on a small section of permanent snow (glacier). The views are very good.

We then took the glacier cable car to the summit. The structures on the summit have an observation deck that gives excellent views in all directions, including an aerial view of the Eibsee lake. The old M√ºnchner Haus, serving food, was very busy.

There are also buildings on the Austrian side of the summit. We crossed to take the views from the observation deck, and ate in the self-service restaurant on the Austrian side, which was considerably less busy than the various facilities on the German side. The food was standard mountain restaurant fare.

The actual summit of the mountain, marked by a cross, can only be accessed by a steep path, which we didn‚Äôt fancy.

We descended by the cable car to the Eibsee. This is operated using large cabin-type cable cars.

We chose to walk around the Eibsee, which is an easy walk of about two hours with good views. Then we took the train back to Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Again we had to change trains at Grainau.

This was an excellent trip, and well worth the EUR 58 per person for the round-trip tickets on the railway and cable cars. However, even though we took the early train, it was busy on a nice day.",
Germany,Zugspitze,On the top of Germany,"Amazing experience which, by mean of a special train, can lead you at the zugspitze ice fields.
Nice opportunity to walk in a lunar landscape with some snow where you can have a nice sliding session for free.
Another step of cableway and you can reach the peak of Zugspitze where you can admire a fantastic landscape in case of clean weather.
To do 100%!",
Germany,Zugspitze,Wonderful experience,"We travelled from Munich on the Garnish Summer ticket with zugspitz. The cost is ‚Ç¨69 which may sound a lot, but it is well worth it and far less than paying for each iindividual item separately. We left Munich on the 8.32 train, and it was an easy transfer at Garnish to the ,mountain railway. Half way up, we then transferred to the cog railway. This was an amazing achievement and also involved a quite long tunnel too. Then off at the glad air station and the cable car to the top. When we got there we could see nothing! Howevr, the cloud soon lifted, and the views wee staggering. We walked around a lot & then had a splendid lunch. For the return journey we took the cable car down to Ebsee and then the train again to Garnish and the 'proper train back to Muich. All for the price of the ticket.

The cable car which takes visitors to the top is the size of a small bus. The spans between cable towers is huge and the gondola travels through dizzying heights. One of the most elevated cable systems I ahve experienced. At the mountain top , there is lot of trekking activities but its quiet windy (when we visited) , in April 2018 when we went it was pretty quiet , there were zero line ups. Food facility at the location is minimal. We had to drive back to the nearby town , there is a Turkish Shawarma restaurant serving halal food and we enjoyed it.

Germany,Zugspitze,ZUGSPITZE Gatterl hiking,"We did the Gatterl hike in July. We started in Ehrwald at 8:00 a.m. taking the cable car Ehrwalder Almbahn. There is a big parking place (only daily parking 8:00-21:00, no camping, no campers allowed), from Ehrwalder Alm we hiked. The path was good, for us mid-demanding, nearly all the 11km going up (only 2 short descents); we had 2 short stops for refreshment and 1 longer stop with lunch in the Knorrh√ºtte. The whole walk took 5,5 hours to get to Zugspitzplatt, where we decided to take a cable car to the top instead of climbing. The sign showed that the last part of the trek takes 1,5 hours, but being already tired and seeing very steep climb ahead with many people there crawling on all fours, clouds with rain coming and a small altitude problem, we gave it up. We used Gletscherbahn instead. And we did well. Just 15 minutes after getting to the top, the rain came so we had only few moments to enjoy the beautiful views. There are some pubs on the top, we had a rest, visited museum and then took the cable car Zugspitzbahn down. The last cable car is scheduled for 4:40 p.m., and we took the one at 4:20p.m. If we had climbed we would have came wet to the top, hadn¬¥t chance to see anything and hardly took the last trip down to Ehrwald. Here we visited small museum. Last bus No. 3 from Talstation Tiroler Zugspitzbahn went at 5:05p.m. and transferred us to our starting point (Ehrwalder Alm parking place) in 15 minutes.
We really liked the trip, even we had to leave the last part for next time. The only disadvantage is the crowds of visitors on the top. Thanks to many cable cars going up, the peak is quite reachable place.
We bought so called Wander Ticket Gatterl - a package of 3 cable cars, 2 small museums and the bus from one cable car to the other. The price for the adult was 44,-Eur.","Written August 2, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,It is a must to visit Zugspitze if you are in Garmisch Partenkirchen,"To avoid crowds we took in the morning first ‚ÄûZugspitzbahn‚Äú to Zugspitz Platte and then the cable car to the top of Zugspitze.

Germany,Zugspitze,Fantastic cable car ride to the Top of Germany,The cable car ride to one of the highest peaks in Europe is spectacular. The view of the glaciers and lakes and Alpine slopes is fantastic. One can view areas in both Germany and Austria. This is an interesting excursion with the Bavarian Alps.,
Germany,Zugspitze,Wow! Spectacular Views!!,"If you are in the area, do not miss out on the opportunity to see the views from the highest point in Germany. We were able to buy our tickets at the hotel we stayed at, which kept us from having to wait in line at the train station (something you may want to inquire about). We took the Cogtrain, and thought the views along the way were beautiful, until we reached the top. Once there, the views were beyond anything we had imagined! SPECTACULAR! We were lucky to be there on a beautiful, sunny day in summer, but we were all in awe of the scenery. We were in shorts, even with some snow still on the ground at the top, and were comfortable that day. But I'd definitely recommend looking at the weather, as we were traveling during a heat wave going through Europe, so no doubt a light jacket may be recommended most of the time. The are free toboggans the kids may use to ride while at the top. There is a place to have lunch during your time there. We spent about 2 hours up there exploring, and of course having fun with photography.",

Many way to get up but the best way is the cable car. It is fast and efficient. Many various places within this place to visit as well.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Take the hit on the price and do it!,"Expensive but so worth it! There are a couple of ways up Zugspitze but as were travelling by car we drove up to Lake Eibsee, parked and got the cog wheel train (one an hour I think) up part way then the glacier cable car to the very top then took the ‚Äòbig‚Äô cable car straight back from top back to Lake Eibsee (you can do train or cable car both ways of prefer). The cog wheel train took about 45 mins and passed through a long tunnel which became a bit boring, the glacier cable car took a couple of minutes and the ‚Äòbig‚Äô cable car about 10 mins...not for you if you are not keen on heights/cable cars! Great restaurant and drinks area with deck chairs and a free sledging area at midway point, more eateries at the very top.

Germany,Zugspitze,Nice view!,"The view from zugspitze was breathtaking! However, getting around the building at the top was confusing and we ended up going back and forth a lot. We took the cable car up and the cogwheel train down, both were interesting experiences but the price was a bit steep at around 60 euro per person. Taking the cogwheel train one way also allows for good photo options and a bit more space to walk around at zugspitplatt.","Written July 24, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,"Be Sure to Visit the ""Top of Germany""","There are two ways to reach the top of Zugspitze, but we were advised to take the cable car up on the Austrian side because the views are much better than if one takes the train(as that apparently goes through tunnels for much of the trip). We were also advised to skip this if the weather was cloudy, so we were lucky to visit on a clear day. Once you get to the top, you have the option of taking a shorter cable car ride to an area of glacier on the mountain which, of course, you should not miss! It was fun to walk across the snow banks on the 4th of July and they even had sledding available! There were lounge chairs to sit and take in the sun while admiring the snowy views. Back on the top, we stopped on the Austrian side and had bratwursts and beer, which seemed to be the more delicious we had anywhere on our trip!!","Written July 22, 2019"

Germany,Zugspitze,Amazing in summer,"Stunning views, and so fun to experience snow in July! Took the train from Garmisch, changed to the cog-wheel train for the ride up. Fun experience with great views going up the steep mountain. Our kids were a little freaked out that there is a bit with a very dark tunnel. In July there was snow at the top and you can borrow free sleds and take a ride in the snow. Ate lunch at the restaurant which was surprisingly good (filling souls, schnitzel, goulash). The next cable car up takes you to the peak. From there you can take the cable car all the way back to Eibsee, and the train back to Garmisch. The very peak is only accessible by climbers where several unskilled selfie-seeking youngsters were jostling for pictures at the narrow top of the rocks along with those who had climbed the mountain. Spent around 3-4 hours with kids aged 5‚Äì11.","Written July 19, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,Fantastic view ... highly recommended,"There are several ways to get to the top of Zugspitze. I can‚Äôt say that I have tried neither the Austrian approach or the train, but the cable car is fantastic and a must see if you are in the region. At the top, enjoy the view and then take the glacier cable car and enjoy the lower level and a walk. Choose a day with clear weather and do expect to wait in line (we waited 40 minutes at the valley). You can go to the top with a goal of hiking or just enjoy the view and scenery...",

Germany,Zugspitze,Stunning views on this unique trip,"We got a train from Garmisch Partenkirchen. Despite having bought tickets the day before and arriving early for the scheduled train, there were massive queues. We got our train 45 mins later than planned which was fine as we were having a lazy day, but bear this in mind.

The train takes you to Grainau where you must all change to the cogwheel train. You can either stay on this train (and switch to short cable car nearer the summit) or, as we did, change at Eibsee to get the cable car right to the top.

The cable car was absolutely jam packed and unfortunately I was stuck in middle unable to see much, being quite short. There is a small square window in the floor though!

At the top it feels a bit contrived, with platforms and railings everywhere, seating for restaurants etc. You don't set foot on the mountain. However, it is necessary due to the sheer amount of people!

Luckily I discovered you could actually climb up the final 20 (?) feet to the summit itself, if you were properly attired and OK to proceed at your own risk. Actually walking on the mountain itself made the trip worthwhile. *Note to Zugspitze staff - many of the pegs and cables to help guide visitors to the summit were loose, making the short climb up quite dangerous *

For lunch there are loads of options. I recommend the freshly made pizzas.

Coming back, we got the short cable car, had a look at the church and the views, and then got the cogwheel train back down. Much of the train ride was inside tunnels, which was very interesting.

It's quite pricey at ‚Ç¨58 each, but definitely worth doing once. Take a good camera with you!",
Germany,Zugspitze,Amazing views from Germany‚Äôs highest peak,"As previously recommended, we took the train up, switched to the cable car for the last section and then the cable car all the way down. Superb views of the Alps from the top. In June there was still a fair amount of snow around. At the bottom we had a pleasant walk around Eibsee lake and then took out a rowing boat. It‚Äôs really beautiful. A great day.","Written June 18, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,Fantastic experience and great staff,"Special thanks to the staff operating the seilbahn who spotted our frail family member, reserved, and guided him to a seat. Can't say how grateful we were. Went up on the train from Grainau, then the short lift, taking the long lift down.
Worth every euro. Great family trip.
Had been sceptical , preferring Alpspitz and cheaper peaks but the zugspitz was great.
Again the staff in our experience were a credit to the organization.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Granddaughter will never forget this!,"My granddaughter is 8 and had the ‚Äúbest day‚Äù at the Zugspitze. It was a sunny day and actually warmer than we expected. She was ecstatic at the snow! We stayed longer than we‚Äôd planned, to let her enjoy it. There are no words to describe the views.","Written June 12, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,What Views,The cogwheel train ride to the top of the zugspitze was pleasant with some fine views. The real treat is after you reach the top station and get to walk out on the glacier and see the wonderful Mountain views. It only gets better after you take the cable car to the near summit viewing platform. The views are spectacular. Great for photos and video. The services up there are also great with a couple of options for good food and drink. You have the option to return by a second cable car or by the train down the mountain. On the whole it was a great way to spend part of a fun day.,"Written June 11, 2019"

Germany,Zugspitze,Amazing Views of the Alps - Breathtaking,"After visiting Jungfrau and mount Titlis last year in Switzerland, our bar was raised high. We went to Zugspitze with these expectations and in all fairness, we weren‚Äôt disappointed.

After visiting here and other places within the Bavarian Valley, I honestly think that Germany is way underrated when compared with Switzerland.

The cable car that took us to the top of the summit offered beautiful views of the valley surrounded by the alps. We were fortunate to find clear skies and could see breathtaking views of Alps from all four countries.

You can descend from either the cog wheel train or the cable car... we took the cog wheel train, but if I was alone, I would have trekked down instead of taking either the train or the cable car.

We drove to Garmisch from F√ºssen traveling on the famous Romantic Road; then took a 15 min train ride to Eibsee where the cable car station is; the cable car runs every 10 min so even if you have to wait a bit - it‚Äôs doable. No need to make prior arrangements, you can but the ticket at the train station or from Garmisch.

On the top, suggest you spend sometime at the summit, you can walk around the Austrian side as well. Some people take the cable car down and spend some time in Austria.

There is also a nice restaurant on the top that was good. On the way down, you take a cable car down to the glacier, where you can do some activities before taking the train down.

All in all.. an amazing experience and a must do activity for anyone visiting the Bavarian Region.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Amazing experience,"We took the cable car up the mountain (worth the money in my opinion - roughly 60 euro I believe). The views at the top were spectacular. There is limited food and beer available at the top, but the food was very good. There were a few clouds on the day we went that weren't an issue, but I think on a cloudy day you could run into some potential issues at the top with not having a view.","Written June 9, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,Absolutely A-Must-Do & Comfortably Reached!,"Bought a Zugspitze Combi ticket at ¬£138 for 2 people @ d blue ticket office (opens at 08:15) in front of platform 30 at the Munich Hauptbahnhof. 2 tickets issued - 1 for Munich to Garmisch train fare, return & d 2nd ticket, d Zugspitze ascent/descent. Took d train to Garmisch on platform 27. At Garmisch, 2nd ticket got changed to a Zugspitze card. Hopped in to a bus for d cog wheel train station. Cog wheel passed through 2 tunnels. Got off the train. Explored the snowy areas for a few minutes. Then cable car to d summit. Breathtaking views on a sunny day! We just depended on the weather forecast & best decision not to buy b4 arrival Munich. Decision to go made on d day of d trip so made it to d Munich Hbf at 7:30. Descent was by a cable car down to Eibsee Lake. Explored it a bit with delish fruity yogurt by d lake (¬£1.15 only). At Eibsee is a bus for Garmisch but d Zugspitze card isnt valid for tht bus so we walked 100 meters towards d train station where we took d train for Garmisch. (Last train for Garmisch is at 17:15!) At Garmisch, took d regional train for Munich Hbf. (Last train for Munich Hbf is at 23:00 or check Deutschebahn website). Did this trip today. We r 1st timers in Germany. English is widely used here. Btw, at the summit, dont miss the pizza & pasta (¬£12each worth it tho for d taste & quality; d Italian pizza maker is very friendly & chatty too). Once-in-lifetime experience for us couple to dine at a summit with heavenly views! All ages r up there even dogs! Don't skip this trip when in Germany!",

Both experiences are very good . Also there are restaurants and souvenir shops there . Mainly there are 2 places... The summit and the glacier. I prefer the glacier because you get to experience snow all over and you also get to sleigh-ride in the snow for free!",

Germany,Zugspitze,Great view,"The ticket may seem pricey but it is absolutely worth it! I bought my ticket from the Zugspitze ticket booth just behind the Garmisch train station. The bus left much later than we were told when buying the tickets so we spent a lot of time waiting around. Once the bus finally left, we went to the cogwheel train. The cogwheel train took us up to Zugspitze where you needed to hop on a cable car to get to the actual peak. It was a sunny day so even though the temperature was below freezing at the top, it felt very pretty warm. There is a nice restaurant at the top where you can eat outside with a view. I recommend the hot chocolate it was delicious. There was a 360 degree view of the mountains and lake and towns. Definitely look on the Zugspitze website for information about visibility and weather on the mountain on the morning you plan to visit as if the weather is bad it is not worth the trip.

I also recommend taking the cable car down to Eibsee when you are done and walking around the lake. It is beautiful and you get a great view of the mountains from the path.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Great view and worth it in a beautiful day with clear skies,"Great view in a clear day. Come early to avoid traffic and park easily. Skiing is also great and in March the snow was better (due to hight) than in Garmisch. It takes about 15 min in the cable car. To enjoy the view, allow yourself at least 1 hour. We spend 5 hours with Ski and food.
They have lockers on the Ski point, but limited in number",
Germany,Zugspitze,Zugspitze,"We went to the top of Zugspitze on the cable car. The view was amazing and delightful. It was November and there wasn't enough snow for skiing, but sledging was great. We spent a lot of time enjoying sledge ride from the slopes. There is a big restaurant on the summit, which is called ""Panorama 2962"". There are tasty Bavarian sausages in this restaurant. Please be aware that the last cable car leaves at 16:00! Pay attention to this otherwise, you will stay on the top till morning.

Germany,Zugspitze,Stunning views awesome experience,We visited this place yesterday . We took the Eibsee cable car to go to this highest peak in Germany . The view at the top was simple breathtaking . There are couple of restaurants there with multiple options . The cable car ride was 5-7 min long . From there we went to the Glacier area through another cable car and finally took the cogwheel train back to Eibsee. Pls note that last train from glacier leaves at 4:30 pm and the last cable car at 4:40 pm . So you need to plan accordingly . But the overall experience was simply amazing !!!,
Germany,Zugspitze,Our zugspitze ride,"A friend and I, along with her daughter, son-n-law and 2 small children rode up to the top of the alps on the Zugspitze in April. It was amazing. The view is spectacular. If you have the chance to do it DO IT! It is almost 50 euros and worth it. If heights scare you, they do me too but the car is big and enclosed and the ride smooth. When you are up there you feel safe and the view is so breathtaking that you forget your fears.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Expensive but nice,"We went on a clear day early in April. There were only a few visitors on top of the Zugspitze so we have enjoyed great views in a fiers and cold wind at 0 degrees. In total we spent about 2,5 hours at the top. So yes, I can recommend to visit the Zugspitze but be aware the returntrip is 46,50 pp which is expensive.",

I can't explain the beauty in words. You have to experience them in person. The train ride, souvenir shop, cafeteria, cable car ride, the view, the wind and chill. Don't forget that while you are up there you can go to the Austria side so make sure you have your passport if you go down to Austria side, you definitely need your passport. It's more than worth experience.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Awesome,"The ride up there takes some time but so worth it! The view is amazing. Ski area is great, the skilifts are well-organised. Was a lot of fun skiing up there.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Amazing experience,"We have been on the peak after fighting ourselves through the H√∂llental via ferrata route. Our starting point was at Hammersbach, so the trip itself was around 13,5 kms with an ascent of 2200+ meters :D Still, it was an amazing and challenging experience for us.","Written March 17, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,Great view no matter what time of year,"We have been here many times, summer and winter. It is a great place to visit no matter what time of year. During the summer and spring you get a great view from the top. Bring a jacket even if it is warm below, it is cold at the top. The wind is very strong. If you are staying at Edelweiss, I suggest you take the train from the ski lodge. It takes you all the way to the top and is an very nice ride. Once on top you can hike, take the lift to the cross or have something to drink at the restaurant. If winter you can sled. It is so much fun. Again if you are staying at Edelweiss rent your sled before you go to the top. The sleds at Edelweiss are larger then the ones rented at the top of the hill. The small ones at the top of the hill are fun, but not as much fun. When you use the small ones snow is kicked up in your face hard. I highly recommend that you visit this site no mater what time of year you are in the area.","Written March 9, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,Will take your breath away,We decided to take the gondola to the top and so happy we did! The weather was perfect! Blue skies...snow and views forever!! The wind whipped the snow and was cold but nothing bad. We did not eat at the restaurant but the views there were amazing!! Stop and take a selfie with the Zugspitze camera near the summit cross. Nice photos with it in the background.,"Written March 3, 2019"
Germany,Zugspitze,Summit via the Hollenthal Route to really appreciate the mountain!,"Its a beautiful and interesting climb of mixed terrain and spectacular views.
I suggest (if you are reasonably fit) to start from Hammersbach very early (I left at 03:30) and went up the narrow Hollenthal valley in which you follow the river, cross various foot bridges and go through tunnels carved into the very rock. By first light i had reached the HollenthalHutte (which has accomodation and restaurant) for those who wish to stop and perhaps for the less abled to turn around. Continuing up the peaceful and silent valley you hit a cliff wall with a steel wire for you to hook onto then you climb the brett and ascend/traverse a moderately taxing Via Ferrata route. Eventually the upper valley levels into scree with no vegetation growing until you hit the glacier which is best crossed with crampons. Climbing this you reach the real Zugspitze and ascend t the peak another few hours free climbing or following a well established via ferrata route.

I completed it solo in less than 9 hours with a 2200+ metre vertical gain over my 10km route from hammersbach to the summit. Its tiring, hard work, but God's was it worth it!

Wonderful views, sometimes the clouds were down and the weather got colder.
At the top several restaurants so had my gulasch soup looking down to the lakes and valley. From the top you can visit Austria! Just stairs or elevator. There is a small museum on Austrian side telling the history of Zugspitze and building all the facilities.
I loved the place! Took back another route, first with a small cable car and then with a mountain train through tunnels and woods. Pretty nice! In the valley the parking lot was packed so I was happy with my early start.","Written January 22, 2019"

Germany,Zugspitze,Holiday Ski Vacation,The entire area is so beautiful but the Zugspitz glacier is amazing! Skiing and snowboarding is way better up there than it is further down at Classico. Even for beginners and young children it is more fun and easier at Zugspitz. The eatery is much bigger but the Classico is tastier. Go up in the gondola and come down with the train or purchase the family ticket and visit Classico and Zugspitz as much as you want in 3 days!,
Germany,Zugspitze,Incredible view from Germany's highest peak,"I hiked up here as part of a large group. You can also simply take a train and then a cable car all the way to the top. The view at the top is amazing and well worth the trip to the top. It is quite a large area at the top and you can see different views from the different sides. There is also a very nice restaurant where we had lunch but was very busy. Some people also climbed to the actual highest point but it looked like you needed to have a bit of experience to make it that far, but you could see the peak just fine from the viewing area.","Written January 9, 2019"

Repeat in reverse for the return trip. more than half your day will be spent just traveling to and from the ski area.

Germany,Zugspitze,Best we did in Germany,"Took a family of 4 up here via the train. If you take the train, get on a couple stops early because the train fills up as it goes and by the time it picks up at the last stop before going up the mountain, it may be full. Also get the lift tickets to the very top when you get the train ticket. The train goes every hour in November 2018 and the lift to the top goes every 10 min. It's breathtaking and amazing. If you really want to risk your life, you can climb out off the tourist platform and make your way to the actual peak where the golden cross is...I didn't dare with my kids, but might have attempted it otherwise. It was a treat to hang out on the platform and watch the others attempt the final climb.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Breathtakingly Beautiful @ 2962m,"Set your GPS for Eibsee and begin your ascent to Zugspitze from here. When I went, only the cogwheel train was available (the cable car was out of commission) and it's only 1 stop to the peak (unlike boarding it from the other stations). Along the ride, you get a beautiful sneak peek at the stunning Eibsee Lake which you should visit thereafter. At the peak, change to the cable car which takes you to almost the very top. You'll need climbing equipment to get to the very top (and a hell of a lot of guts). The feeling of looking out to the horizon from every angle is simply indescribable. Honestly I could feel my heart swell to bursting. I wanted to weep from how beautiful it was. I feel thoroughly enriched from this experience!",

Germany,Zugspitze,A brilliant day out with superb weather,"To start this review I have to say that we had the best weather you can have on top of any mountain: it was sunny throughout! And that has influenced my ""5 stars"" a lot! Places like this rise and fall with the weather, so before you go up here, make sure that the weather forecast is favourable!
We went in June (sorry for late review) and the temperature was in the low single digits, so imagining being up here when it rains and is windy, and we wouldn't have liked it that much for sure!
We bought a two summits' pass for the Zugspitze and Garmisch Classic, if you have time for both then it's a lot cheaper that way.
Although we had a hire car, we took the Zugspitzbahn to the cable car, partially because the train stopped basically outside our hotel in Grainau Hammersbach. It's a nice ride in a lovely little train.
The ride up the mountain with the cable car is awesome. We had beautiful views! For US readers: a cable car for us is a ""car hanging from a rope"", not moving along a rail track. The Zugspitzbahn itself actually goes up the mountain as well and I think a lot of you would call that a ""cable car"" or ""cable railway"".
Our time on top of the mountain was also fab! We first spent some time in the restaurants' areas where you can walk from Germany into Austria :), how cool is that?
Beautiful views all around and for those wanting a bit of extra adventure, you could take the short hike up to the Summit of the Zugspitze but although short, it looks like you'd need good shoes to do this!
From the top there's then another cable car bringing you a little down to the ""Gletscher"" area, the area where there's ice and snow, even in the middle of June! We used sledges to go down a hill, it was a blast!
We also sat down facing the sun in the sun loungers in the restaurant on the Austrian side of the mountain top, drinking my favourite Austrian drink ""Almdudler"" :)
And we went downhill again with the cable car, again with breath-taking views!
This day out is a MUST for everybody in the area but as I said before, make sure the weather is dry as a minimum and preferably it should be sunny! Then I'm sure you'll love it up there, too!",
Germany,Zugspitze,Beautiful,"Although it was a cloudy, cold and windy day we thoroughly enjoyed visiting Zugspitze! We also enjoyed a nice lunch.

(Train to Garmisch using the Bayern ticket, change to train which takes you several miles to cogwheel train, which takes you to cable car, which takes you to stairs in building, which takes you to top!) The cogwheel train is mostly in a tunnel which cuts down on views but makes the cable car than much more dramatic! In all I went from green fields, to changing leaves on the trees to blowing snow. There's a nice cafeteria and restaurant at the top where you can enjoy the view from the floor to ceiling windows. I also walked across to the Austrian side of the viewing platform (no passport needed). It's important to pick a clear day; even though I had one, at times the blowing snow obscured the view. Apparently one can even walk to a nearby higher point using a ladder and steel steps but it was too cold and snowy (and scary!) for me. I repeated my trip in reverse and marveled at the difference between the sharp peaks and pancake flat topography near Munich.","Written November 2, 2018"

Germany,Zugspitze,Stunning: worth the ticket,"Arrived at the end of the cable car to the top of Zugspitze at 11 on a Monday in October and it was already busy. Plan ahead to get here early and think carefully about peak season.
We decided to take the Cable Car from Elbsee in Austria instead of the one from Germany and it was well worth it: it is quicker to get to the top (about 10 minutes) than from the German line.
The cable car sways a bit on the way up as it passes the stanchions, and it is spectacular because of the steep nature of the ascent. It passes over pines first then grey rock near the top.
We were lucky but had been looking at the weather for a week or so before we went and had a clear day. The views on all sides were breathtaking. Some areas (about midday) still had a little fog in the valleys which added to the beauty.
There is a good canteen restaurant at the top where three of us ate for ‚Ç¨43.
Spend time looking at the pictures. It is unmissable if you are in the area.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Worth the expense!,"If you‚Äôre in the area this is a must see. At 56‚Ç¨ a ticket it‚Äôs not cheap but we enjoyed every second of the ride there and back and spent quite a bit of time up the mountain. We caught the cog wheel train from Garmisch to the top of the mountain and it was definitely worth the time and expense for the views. We visited in October and were very lucky that the weather was beautiful and visibility was excellent (although coming from Scotland we‚Äôre fairly hardy and would have gone regardless).
The facilities at the top are fab and we enjoyed Currywurst und ein Helles in the restaurant - good value for money! There is plenty of room for you to eat a packed lunch too.
We explored both the German and Austrian sides, rode the Cable car to the summit and then stopped off at the Eibsee for a wander on our way back down.

Germany,Zugspitze,"Beautiful scenery, great cable care ride, Incredible construction and many amenities at the top","Zugspitze is a wonderful experience not only for the beautiful scenery but other features like the cable car ride, views and the other amenities found at the top. The scenery speaks for itself whereas the new cable car system is an engineering masterpiece. One can choose between the cog railroad and the cable car. We chose the cable car ride for both the assent and decent. The car holds about 50 people comfortably and takes only 10 minutes for the assent/ decent. Cog railroad consumes much more time. When you arrive at the top you will see an incredible infrastructure with all the modern conveniences and restaurants one can ask for. When you survey the scenery you will see just how much the folks use this mountain for hiking and other outdoor activities. We missed taking the cable car to a lower activity level and recommend that should you go, be aware that there is the optional cable car ride down to a lower level. No need to pack a lunch as the restaurants are excellent. Take a camera, binoculars and don't rush your visit. We spent 4 hours atop the mountain and didn't do all that we could have done. Lastly, check weather conditions before you go. We held out for a perfectly clear and sunny day (Sept 8) and that paid dividends as we never needed to wear coats or gloves. When in Bavaria consider visiting Zugspitze it is well worth the time, money and effort.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Walk from Germany to Austria,This excursion was one of my top highlights while touring Germany. Taking the cog train from Garmisch-Partenkirchen to the final stop where you will find spectacular mountain views with villages nestled down below. Then rid the gondola a short distance to the top where you can walk across a pathway to Austria. Enjoy a cold beer or a hot chocolate with optional rum.

Germany,Zugspitze,At the very top of Germany,"Zugspitze is Germany's highest point and is right on the border with Austria (in fact, once you're up there you can walk across in Austria and back again). As so many other reviewers have said, it is absolutely spectacular. We took the round trip upon from Garmisch-Partenkirchen, catching the cog train and gondolas. It was a dull, wet day when we set off but we only had limited time so we decided to go ahead anyway. We found the cog train to be very busy indeed, and the three of us couldn't sit together. But the views as you travel are beautiful, as you chug through picturesque little village and alpine meadows, with lovely views of the Eibsee lake. The railway drops you by the Zugspitze glacier, and this is where you realise you really should have packed some warm clothes. Luckily we had come prepared with puffer jackets but it was still pretty icy. When we were there, sleet was driving horizontally with a biting wind and although some people were braving the cold and playing on the ice, we opted to get the glacier lift up to the top.

At the top, the views were breathtaking. The clouds had cleared the top of the mountain and we could see for miles. It was still pretty cold but you really didn't notice because you could not take your eyes off the scenery. We also walked across into Austria and had coffee and cake in the cafe there, which was delicious. (And warm!). Finally we took the new gondola down to Eibsee, to link up with the cog railway again (though we decided to take a very rainy walk right round Lake Eibsee before carrying on down into the town). It was a longish day - we caught the 10am train up and the last train down so it was already evening by the time we got back. But views like that stay with you forever, and it was very memorable. We look at the photos now we're back home in Australia, and can't believe we were there!",
Germany,Zugspitze,A superb sight atop of the German and Austrian Alps,I took the train from Garmisch-Partenkirchen and had to transfer trains before reaching the plateau short of the summit.

Germany,Zugspitze,A stunning peak with incredible views and colors!,"Went for a day visit to Zugspitze in the Garmisch-Partenkirchen area of Bavaria, Germany.

A true WOW! I have been twice to the Swiss Alps, Zermatt area and I always thought this was the ultimate location for a mountain peak experience...

This visit to Zugspitze really changed my feelings. The peak is an absolute, unexplored stunner!! The experience starts from the lower level itself , with the amazing emerald green / turquoise blues of the lagoons / lakes below and the incredible green all around , until you reach the peak.

Once you reach the peak, it is just raw beauty - nature at its best! I also think that the weather played a key role. The day I went up, it was a clear day and it was truly a Heaven on Earth to see all the adjacent cliffs, the plains far away in the distance and the incredible emerald greens of the lakes below!! Wow!!

I truly believe The Swiss Alps and Zermatt are much more well marketed BUT a raw beauty and natural environment, Zugspitze peak is much more Beautiful and unexplored!!

An employee we asked only reiterated that it hadn‚Äôt been working but that we could take the cog train. While that is okay it isn‚Äôt what we wanted.
At the very least they should post a notice before you enter the parking lot because we still had to pay 4 euros for the 15 minutes we were there.

After an hour, clouds started clearing up and we experienced majestic views of German Alps. We also enjoyed the cable car on our way down and took the train from Eibsee to Garmisch-Partenkirchen. We also did ice sledding when sun was out and visibility improved which was a nice experience. It was a good day spent but please check weather forecast before you plan your visit as peaks like these can experience snow, rain, clouds very often which spoils the views.",
Germany,Zugspitze,On top of the world!!,I love mountains!!! This was the highlight of my trip. It's an incredible feeling to be so high up. Take the short ride to the glacier where you can walk around. We took the cable car from the Austrian side. Quicker than taking the train from the German side.,"Written September 18, 2018"
Germany,Zugspitze,Worth the Time and Cost,"We really enjoyed the visit. Parking was readily available and the cable car experience was very comfortable. Unlike other cable cars I have experienced this one runs very close to the mountain surface as you go up and down. No safety issues, but does make it exciting. Super views all around. Plenty to see at the top. There were several options for refreshments and even meals at the top. This was not an overly touristy spot and was mostly locals on our visit. It was fun to experience the clouds move in and envelope us as we departed. I would recommend planning 3-4 hours to take your time and enjoy it.","Written September 17, 2018"
Germany,Zugspitze,Breathtaking view,"This is a must in Bavaria. The Tram goes up the German or Austrian side. We could see all of the 400 mountain peaks and 4 countries clearly on this visit, 2018. The first time we went in 1988 it was snowing and we could not see anything when we got to the top of mountain. Watch the weather. We ate Weissewurst and drank Bavarian Beer at the top.","Written October 2, 2018"
Germany,Zugspitze,Disappointed after much build up,"Zugspitze was on our list from the beginning of places to see. When we arrived we were told that they were cutting off entrance to Zugspitze. We then bought tickets to Alpspitze, the second highest peak. While waiting for the train we watched them continuing to sell tickets to Zugspitze, so we just got back in line and bought the ticket to Zugspitze. It was very confusing and chaotic. We did get our money back for the Alpspitze ticket. The cable car was broken. We took a train up most of the way and then a short other cable car ride. The train ride up took approximately an hour and a half. When we arrived the view was beautiful, but only needed to be seen for approximately 30 minutes. After grabbing a quick bite to eat, we headed to the train to go back down. We waited for 40 minutes to get on the train. After we were on the train, it took 1.5 hours to get back down. Overall, we spent at least 6 hours there for about 30 minutes of seeing the top. Additionally, there is no labeling of what peak is what country which was slightly frustrating considering they advertise that the most.
Overall, if you‚Äôre coming here, make sure you leave Munich VERY VERY early to beat the traffic we got caught in both there and the way back. Also, maybe do not attempt to attend during Oktoberfest. We were guessing that might have highly increased the amount of visitors (and traffic). Last, make sure the cable car is working before attending. Otherwise the trip is long, miserable, and very overcrowded. The ticket was 60 euro so the price was not cheap for how poorly the place was organized.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Good experience,We took a cogwheel train up and cable car down. Weather was fantastic thus views from top and cable cars were breathtaking. Recomended,"Written September 17, 2018"
Germany,Zugspitze,Gorgeous Views,"I am not a fan of heights so it took a lot of persuasion to get me to the top of this mountain which is the highest point in Germany. You have two different options to get to the top. We went up on the high speed modern cable car and came down by cog railroad. The trip up was speedy (thankfully). The cable car took a little more than 10 minutes and basically goes straight up. The car had a small plastic window in the floor from which I stayed well away! At the top is a small restaurant, souvenir shop and viewing area. The 380 degree view was spectacular and I was glad I endured the trip up. The trip down was easier with a short conventional cable car ride to the glacier just below the peak. At the glacier you can catch the cog railway down. The railway was less eventful and less scary because about the first half of the trip is spent in a tunnel. The entire round trip cost about 50 euro per person. Go to the Zugspitze website first before going up to get an idea about visibility up top. We went first thing in the morning and the visibility was clear for miles and miles.","Written September 15, 2018"
Germany,Zugspitze,A musst visit,"When people decide to visit Bavaria, I firmly believe this is a must visit to everyone.

Must try.","Written September 14, 2018"
Germany,Zugspitze,Must see when visiting Munich,"On our visit the cable car was not in operation and it was cloudy. You can get almost to the top on the cogwheel railway, and at the end of the line is a restaurant, toilets and a small gift shop.
Much of the journey is through a tunnel, but there are some brilliant views before hand, especially of the lake.
We took a DB train to Garmisch and from the station the cog-wheel train is easy to find. It cost 65‚Ç¨ return for an adult.
We met a very nice German lady who said on public holidays up to 6,000 people visit the mountain, so probably best avoided then.
I saw a review which said people with heart problems should avoid the cable car. This might be true for asthmatics too. Both of us needed our inhalers at the top, even though it wasn't particularly cold.
I have no head for heights so was not disappointed about the cable car. If it matters to you best to check.before setting out.
It was 24¬∞ in Munich, but up the mountain we needed a fleece and a waterproof as it was quite a bit colder, and it rained.","Written September 13, 2018"
Germany,Zugspitze,One beautiful experience,"Zugspitze is the top of üá©üá™ Germany.
Easily accessible by train from Munich;around 1& a half hour away by train is a little town Garmisch. This little town is very interesting. From the main train station in Garmisch there is a separate platform which runs the train to and from Zugspitze. We got the tickets from there as there is a separate ticket office.
We took this train and got off at lake Eibsee. From here we took the very recently installed cable car. If we continued on the train then we could go all the way to the top by cogwheel train but that would take longer and it also crossed the tunnel so we preferred to go to the top by cable car as it took only 10 minutes.
The cable car was recently installed and was in emasculate condition. It was quite big and it is said that it can hold up to 120 people. .

There is a restaurant on the top where you can eat. Although we preferred to have lunch when we came down alongside Eibsee lake.
If you are in Munich then it is a must do.","Written September 13, 2018"
Germany,Zugspitze,Beautiful,"We bought return round trip tickets from Garmish. The train to Eibsee is worth it for seeing some scenery but cycling will also be fun. If you afraid of heights this may well not be worth the immense cost (56 euros per adult) so bare this in mind. Wear warm cloths with cool layers as the top can be cold. Take your own picnic, the restaurant is very pricy. The glacier at the top is not a glacier - more a large piece of frozen ice but nevertheless the views are spectacular. If you are fit, take the effort to plan some walks from there although climbing gear recommended. We took the cog wheel train down. It's okay but rather slow.","Written September 13, 2018"
Germany,Zugspitze,Beautiful!,"Really breathtaking scenery. We were there in May and it was lovely :) We took the earliest train and took the cable car to the peak. Spent the whole day there.

Germany,Zugspitze,"Trip to the Zugspitze ,Germany's highest peak","The 2,962-m-high Zugspitze is a mountain of superlatives.Germany's highest elevation, is host to three glaciers.
The cogwheel train takes 70 minutes from Zugspitze Railway Station in Garmisch-Partenkirchen via Grainau on the idyllic Eibsee lac and to the Zugspitze Tunnel, to the Zugspitzplatt.From there you can continue with the Gletscherbahn cable car which offers spectacular panoramic view of the lac Eibsee and the foothills of Alps.",
Germany,Zugspitze,An absolute must.,The view is breathtaking. Very interesting ride to the top. Restaurants and food very nice. Spend whole day there. Was awesome.,
Germany,Zugspitze,amazing (but very pricey),"We bought the combined round-trip ticket and took the cog train from Garmisch-Partenkirchen to Eibsee, then the new cable car (the Seilbahn Zugspitze) up to the peak of Zugspitze.

The queue for tickets at Garmisch station was very long, but at least a last came round giving out packets of Haribos to stop our kids' ears popping on the cable car!

Once at the top of the mountain we changed into warm clothes - despite being 30degC at Eibsee it was only about 10degC at the summit. Views were amazing. We took the short cable car 350m down to the glacier and the kids threw snowballs and went on the free-to-use toboggans to skid down the glacier. Fantastic to be able to do this in the height of summer.

My one main tip is not to do what we did and get the cable car back down, then change to the cog train at Eibsee. If you leave at or near the end of the day - I think the last cable car down is at 5.45pm - then the crowds waiting for the train at Eibsee will be huge. It's not as if you get a great view in the packed cable car on the way down. If I were to do it again I'd take the cog train from the summit all the way down to Eibsee and then stay on it to Garmisch-P. In theory it takes longer than using the cable car but you're far more likely to get a seat on the train and in any case you might not get on the first train from Eibsee if you came down on the last or before-last cable car.",
Germany,Zugspitze,Spectacular experience,"This was our second time to the Zugspitze, and was awesome. This time we traveled to the Austrian side (Tiroler Zugspitzbahn) which was exceptionally fast up the heights. It is a lot further than the German side in Garmisch Parkenkichen, if your traveling from Germany. At the summit the resturant is pricey but very good......try the soups...excellent!",
Germany,Zugspitze,Fun,"Even in summer the peak must be done. The trip up f4om Garmisch was beautiful on the train and then the cable car. Once you reach the top grab a sausage and take in the view. There is a permanent snow field that you can sled on at no charge, and some crazy hikes (not for beginners).","Written September 6, 2018"
Germany,Zugspitze,Eurotrip 2018,"This is great place to visit. Good for the family, take a cog wheel train than a lift to the summit.

There are few places to grab a bite to eat or drink and gift shops.

Very cool! Open at Christmas but there's nothing special going on. We wanted a white Christmas and boy did we get it!

I wouldn't recommend the cog wheel train as it's much slower and not as good a view, but it's more comfortable as they pack the new cable car to bursting.","Written August 28, 2018"
Germany,Zugspitze,"A great, if expensive trip","We done the round trip from Garmisch - taking the train up to the Glacier level (note you have to change trains at Elbsee), then the short cable car to the summit and then the longer cable car back down to Elbsee. If I'd realised I could have reduced the cost of the trip by parking at Elbsee and doing the round trip from there. However, the trip is very worthwhile doing but obviously only on a clear day. The views are great and the overall experience of getting up and down using the train and cable cars is good. A great day trip.",

I didn't hear what they were talking about. The next part of the exhibit was up a ramp. The attendant at the top told me that two bags are not allowed. I told her the man at the front didn't say anything and let me come it. She said it was written somewhere. Great. The attendant I just talked to said it was fine and I can continue on. The one above kept staring at me. So I put my camera bag inside my backpack, while the attendant above watched. After the process, I was compliant with one back, worn in front. But she kept watching me. If she was trying to make me uncomfortable, she succeeded.

There is no cost of admission. Masks were required.","Written June 11, 2020"
Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,Outstanding information and displays - fascinating look into modern German history,"We visited Bonn, in part, to get a feel for modern German history and targeted this museum as a place to visit. We were certainly not disappointed! There is such a wealth of historical information, but all so highly relevant and expertly curated. I spent hours in just the first room (covering the immediate post-war period up to Cold war) before dashing through some of the next ones. It is well worth a visit even if you only have half an hour, but you could spend a few days here too. Much recommended, and I only hope I can visit again soon.","Written March 13, 2020"

Entrance is free and there are lockers and a staffed cloakroom to leave backpacks and coats.

Get the audio guide, particularly if you don't read German - it's free but you need to leave a driving licence, ID or passport as a deposit.

The audio guide is fairly easy to follow, although I occasionally struggled for a few minutes to find the next station. There are optional extra audio tracks, which you can skip if you want to go faster.

Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,"Outstanding, wide-ranging and important in these days of turmoil","This (free to enter) museum is a brilliantly curated journey through the extraordinary post-WWII roller-coaster history of this mighty nation. Probably best for older children of 13+, and it needs at least 2 hours to even get close to doing it justice - but with the great reward of gaining a really multi-dimensional (and strongly Western) perspective on key events, mindsets, politics, economics...

Yes, the exhibits are in German (since, well, they are German exhibits..), but along with the very many main exhibit descriptors being in English, and free-to-borrow audio narrating devices in English, it makes for a perfect compromise (and encouragement in our learning of languages!).","Written December 28, 2018"

Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,HAUS DER GESCHICHTE was super informative and entertaining!!,"We drove a long way to Bonn only to visit this museum (""Haus der Geschichte""), and I'm glad to report that it was well worth our journey. I do wish that we'd planned the day better but we didn't realise just how large and comprehensive this museum is.

My suggestion to future visitors:
- go early in the day
- bring a pack lunch with you (the caf√© is not great and very pricey, and there is NOTHING else in the area), or at least snacks you can eat in the garden
- wear comfortable shoes
- enquire about guided tours and/or audio guides in your language if you don't speak German (only very little information presented in English, and hardly anything in French)

The museum is structured in chronological order, starting with the capitulation document signed at the end of the second world war. This initial decade following the end of the war is arguably the most interesting, and we spent at least 1.5 hours if not longer, in that area. Later on, it becomes less serious and more entertaining with music, fashion and products on display from the 1960s and 1970s. The 1980s focus on politics, and the 1990s obviously on the reunification of the country.
East Germany (DDR) is portrayed very negatively - I don't know if this is the interpretation of the museum curators or actual facts, but it all looks and sounds like utter misery and communist brainwashing. If that triggers you, you may want to skip those decades.
As it's ""contemporary history"", I image that this museum will be a constant work in progress, and I look forward to returning one day. Highly recommend it to anyone!","Written October 15, 2018"

Overall, the museum was laid out in a logical way and had many different styles of trying to convey information to try to keep visitors engaged. However, within each individual 'exhibition' I often found the layouts confusing/nonsensical and I feel like it might need a review.

I also think the main foyer would benefit from some additional signage that directs visitors towards the entrance and where they might get audioguides etc.

Mr. Adenauer's Mercedes and his train are on display. Several audio and video installations, as well as books, describe his time in German government.
Unfortunately due to reconstruction main part of the museum was closed. Still it was interesting to learn about Germany as the country of societies (Verein). There are more than 600000 of them in Germany.

Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,Well worth it,"Have to admit I was skeptical, because having been to a German History National Museum in Berlin, which was so comprehensive and wasn't sure how this would fare.

Not to worry! I went with two Germans, one had visited some years earlier; we all thought this was well worth the time. These exhibits really focus on the aftermath of WWII and how it lead to the Cold War and the different approaches to the economy and how things evolved through the decades. The curators of this museum brought many human elements to bring history to life (actual footage of TV programs showing young kids trying to reconnect to kin right after the war, parts of the real ""candy bombers"" that enabled Berlin to survive the Russian blockade, voting stations showing how each part of Germany voted in key elections, a real Volkswagen camper van, etc)

Grey colored signs have both English and German translation.
The others only have German. Getting the free audio guide (either in German or English), is helpful.

As usual, the time wasn't enough for us (3.5 hours) - we had to rush through reunification, which was perhaps one of the most moving and interesting aspects.

Definitely will come back.",
Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,Powerfully honest,"I have visited this museum twice. Each time I have been struck by the superb way it is elegantly organized for the benefit of its many visitors. More than that though ... it is the way the museum provides such thorough and honest explanations, gripping photographs and other fascinating artifacts that make the time spent at the museum so worthwhile from several perspectives. For me, as a foreign visitor born in England at the time the Second World terminated,it is how the museum becomes a powerful teaching medium inviting the visitor to think and learn.","Written December 5, 2016"

Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,Interesting for everyone!,"I love the History Museum since the first time I've been there. When you have time visiting Bonn, you should definitely go there. Even (or especially!) if you are usually not so fond of history and museums.
You get the chance to literally WALK through German history and there are various attractions for different target groups. Of course like in any museum you can read a lot of information. What makes this museum special, though, is the variety of media involved in the exhibition which makes the whole visit interactive. Movies, speeches, original documents, soundtracks, contemporary witness reports, .... Another thing that comes to my mind is that not everything is behind glass; for example you can sit in the seats of the former Bundestag.
You can easily spend three hours in the museum but if you just have one or two hours I still recommend to go. Since the entry is free you can always take the chance and take a glimpse at German history!","Written October 26, 2016"

Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,Great exhibition!,"This modern and up-to-date exhibition is centered on the history of Germany after the end of WWII.

Here you can learn much about the reconstruction following the Nazi years and the war, the key-figures in the process, the shaping of two Germanies and the communist dictatorship in the East, the relationship between the two sides of the Iron Curtain, and much more.

All this for free and along a modern but detailed exhibition - really enjoyable.

Great job! Highly recommended for everybody and especially for those with an interest in the Cold War period, when Germany was a primary 'stage of events' in Europe.

Plan at least one hour for the least interested person.

Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,History presented in a unique and innovative way,"First, what impressed me was the free entrance. Second, it was the good location and more than everything it was the innovative way of the main exhibition. I hope the curators are reading the reviews from here - you, guys, did great job. Be prepared to dedicate around 2-3 hours to the main exhibition which starts with the beginning of WWII and separation of Germany, passing through the periods of economic ups and downs, Woodstock and Beatles' songs, forming of women fights for emancipation and ends with real pieces from Berlin wall. It is impressive and very multilayered exhibition with video screens, small cinema theater like in old times, propaganda posters, different political parties announcements, sample of old Volkswagen and a lot of other things that is about to facinate you. The main stages of the exhibition are also written in English but every object of the exhibition is explained only in German, however you can rent an audio guide which we forgot to did (: check the museum's website for actual prices of the audio guides, there is no special museum parking but on Saturday at 16 o'clock we managed to find free spot in thre nearby streets. You can walk from thre museum to the city center on the Reine promenade for about an hour. Next to the museum there are stops of underground tram and buses.","Written August 21, 2016"
Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,Why we love and respect Germany,"What a frank, brave and open-minded approach to over 50 years of post-ww2 tumultuous history. Well laid out and, as far as i could tell, sought not to hide anything. Really worth a visit for young and old - and, such a relief, to find something for free. We weren't offered English language headphones - don't now if they exist - would be good if they did for, whilst there are many written English translations for certain sections I felt, even with German A-level, that I was missing some of the really interesting detail. Again, perhaps because I missed it, I was confused when trying to identity whether a particular section referred to East or West Germany. Such a contrast to the old museum of German history that I visited in East Berlin before the wall came down. Well done Germany -we love you!",
Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,Mandatory (and free) attraction in Bonn,"Some may not know, but the German National Museum of Contemporary History is only one part out of three museums in Germany (the other two are located in Berlin and Leipzig). Each part focuses on different time and perspective of German history.

The museum is not only very informative, it tells the story very well. Exhibitions are set in a way that gives you a new perspective about German history post WWII. We loved the parallel story part of the museum, that dealt with how the Germans are handling their history while trying to build a better future (this story is told inside black cubes located through your way in the museum).

Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,Spent 4 hours in the best museum on German history,"This is a great venue. The museum starts at 1945 the end of he war and takes you through to the year 2000. There are 4 floors. The exhibits were excellent. We are not German speakers so we used English audio headsets. If you are German or speak German this venue could take 8-10 hours to read all of the memorabilia and history records. It really is amazing. From a 1945 Willy's jeep, to part of a Berlin Airlift fuselage, to the World Cup winners to moon rocks and a 1960 hippie VW bus. It has it all. WE will definitely return if we are there again. There is also a cafeteria on site to eat and stop for a drink, a coat check room, an information desk where you can pick up the tour headsets.

Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,Great FREE museum. A MUST DO when in Bonn.,"For a FREE museum, this is better than most of the paid admission museums.

The history of modern Germany (since the end of WWII) is clearly outlined in well thought out exhibits in chronological order.

Most exhibits are in German and English, making this a very pleasurable museum. But most of the English translations are very limited (1 paragraph English & 4 paragraphs in German). Some exhibits are lacking translations.

Plan on a few hours to see all of the exhibits. From the East - West German split, Stalin, the founding of NATO, the Berlin Wall, the prosperity of West Germany, Olympic teams, the reunification of East & West Germany.

Didn't see any mention of the influence Ronald Reagan had on the reunification of East & West Germany and the fall of the Berlin wall.

We even found free parking on the street around the corner.",
Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,Thought procokin,"Decided to visit as the museum was the number one attraction in Bonn on Trip Advisor. The entrance we entered is a good start, down an escalator into a train platform with a very interesting train exhibit. The museum is large & set over several floors, starting from the end of ww2 and flowing chronological forwards. There were A LOT of students when we went & manners were in short supply but we kept on ploughing through being barged in front of!

Beware everything is almost entirely German language-only, which can be unhelpful to say the least if you cannot read German, but ideal if you are in Bonn as a language student! Somewhat incongruously, the basement is dedicated to Roman Bonn, although I found the quality of both the exhibits and their presentation to be excellent. In warm weather, the museum garden is delightful. Best of all, it is all free, including the wardrobe and the lockers.",

Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,Simply magnificent,"This is extraordinary: wonderful, moving, heartbreaking, funny. Literally thousands of objects beautifully presented telling a remarkable story of the nation that reinvented itself twice - in the post-1945 miracle, and again in the time of unification. And for me personally (I was born in 1950) it told the story of my own life living through those times and observing these world-shaping events.. Too many highlights to list here though I hugely enjoyed the aircraft used in the Berlin airlift and the1950s jukebox, but I could go on and on.

Only one complaint - though there is a very good English language audio guide there is not very much English-language labelling of the items on display, so sometimes you do not get as much information and context as you would like. But there's still almost too much to take in in a single day's visit.

As an American history buff I found many things familiar and many things I did not know. Of particular interest was the perspective difference; shockingly my education may have been a little one-sided, being raised during the Cold War and all.
There are just barely enough English descriptions to give you a feel of the flow of the times, but I felt like I wasn't getting it all. Some of the exhibits needed no translation and were quite moving, shared a few tears with a local woman about my age.

We had the pleasure to be guided by a wonderful mr. Martin who, for the whole time of the tour was able to keep attention of the whole group of about 15 students (which is not so easy). He spoke fluently English and of course German. Even if you know some German don't be afraid to take a tour in the language, his choice of words makes it so much easier to understand.

The only thing I'd consider a fault is not too many English translations. If you speak no German, since you save some money for the entrance (which is free), pay it for a guide.

Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,Fantastic!,"This is a superb museum, which must rival any historical museum in the world. It is focussed on German history from 1945 and deals really well with the transformation of Germany through the ‚ÄòWirtschaftswunder‚Äô / economic miracle and other challenges like occupation, division and reunification. The audioguide in English is excellent, although it only picks-out about 5% of the exhibits for explanation - there were so many other exhibits that I wanted to understand but couldn‚Äôt. The audio order seemed a bit random at times too. There is an excellent caf√©/restaurant for lunch (‚Ç¨10 each for beer and bratwurst with chips) with wifi for customers, although we couldn‚Äôt really make this work easily. You need to go into the library next to the cafe and ask for a temporary password.","Written July 26, 2015"
Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,Something good for all generations,"We visited this museum with grandmother and our 11 year old son and there was something that really grabbed each of us in this well put together exhibit. For me it was filling in my lack of history knowledge from the end of Ww2 through the fall of the Berlin Wall and everything leading up to the East/West Germany split. For my mother and her friend it was being reminded of things in their lives during childhood and remembering the orphaned children posters. For our son it was that plus the rise of German manufacturing and seeing how mechanical design has evolved up to the current day and his life.

And there is so much more! To really do it justice, get the free audio tour in your language of choice and plan on spending most of the day here.

For people old enough to remember the Cold War experience, this exhibit will give an additional and important facet to the events of the second half of the 20th century.

When I asked how long it would take, the receptionist suggested 45 minutes. What she didn't say is that was just the audio guide - I was there nearly three hours and only left because it was closing time!

the exhibits are authentic and takes one back into the relevant periods.
highly informative for anyone wanting to know how Germany rose from ruins.

we were pleasantly surprised at the 'Red Carpet' welcome right on the heussallee / museumsmeile tube station where a large set of exhibits greet the visitors from where escalators took us directly to the museum's reception area.

while the students of political science and history can spend days at the museum normal visitros need to allow 2-3 hours for a reasonable tour.
other notable part is that the museum entry as well as audio guides (in English and German) are free.

We had a strange experience toward the end of our tour, however. Close to 7 p.m. (closing time of the museum) the guards became quite nervous and a couple of minutes before they were almost chasing us out, even if we were with an official tour guide. Some of them waved their hand ""get out"", which we did. Once we were at the entrance, the other guards already waited for the sign, that they are dismissed. When it came, some of them ran as fast as they could and were taking off their uniforms on the run - very bizarre.","Written December 2, 2013"

Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,WWII to Current Times - Free Entrance - Interesting Place,"This museum offers a very interesting overview of Germany's development and various stages since 1945 and has a lot of visual items that are interesting even to those of us who do not read German. Many of the interpretive signs were translated into English and at least some of the videos had either English voice overs or captions to help English-speaking tourists understand. There are cars, bombs, parts of airplanes, letters, photographs, flags and all sorts of artifacts on display to add to the overall effect.

When we visited in October 2013, there was a second exhibit on The American Way which went into various influences American culture has had on German culture over the years from movies, music, clothing fashions and other fads. Even some American holiday traditions have crept across the ocean and made their way into many German neighborhoods and I found it very interesting to see how the two cultures have come together in many ways, even while maintaining individual interpretations of each fad. A very impressive display of everyday things not directly related to the war and post-war political developments shown in the other exhibits.

In addition, this museum has a place where you can safely leave your belongings - a coat check area and storage lockers - and there is a reasonably-priced cafe with a decent selection of food items upstairs. They also have elevators [lifts] for those of us who have some difficulty with stairs so that was very welcome for my injured knee.

Overall, this was a very worthwhile way to spend several hours and I think we could have easily spent twice as long there as we had time to spend. The friends who took us there have already made plans to return and we will probably visit this museum again on our next visit to the area.",

The artifacts presented, the way of exposing produced a strong, hard to describe impression...And if it is to add that all the experience is for free...there is an absolutely ""must visit"" for every tourist in Bonn.","Written September 1, 2013"

Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,"Lots to see, hear and touch - a must for history fans.","This museums documents the history of Germany from the end of WWII till today. It start's straight on with the train car of the German chancellors as you come up from the Underground. After that it's on to the end of the war, showing items and pictures, but also eye-witness interviews that you can listen too and videos of the 1940s and 50s. In the beginning everything is in one hall, then - corresponding to the division of Germany - the story is told with East and West Germany on opposite sides of each room. It's fascinating to look at one incident and then turn around a look at what went on in the other Germany at the same time.

The museum has lots of things to enjoy. If you read or understand German, it's a plus, but if not get the guided tour.

You should give yourself lots of time for this - 3 hours or more. Towards the end the exhibition is naturally more well-known and focuses on the political development and the EU, but also environmental matters.","Written May 5, 2013"

There are lots or interesting atrifacts to see such as a Russian Tank, Sections of The Berlin Wall, Various Original Documents, The Space Suit worn by the first German Astronaut etc.
A keen history buff could spend many hours there, or a couple of hours will allow you to do the basics.

Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,German time capsule,"I admit that I went to this museum without great expectations. How interesting can one make history of recent times? How wrong I was! After spending much longer in the museum than I anticipated, I would rate it as the top sight in Bonn, even if you don't have any special interest in Germany.

You start on the ground floor and wind your way from ""Hour Zero"" of German history (May 1945) to the Seventies in fairly systematic way. The idea is to tell the story of the times through newspapers, posters, artifacts, and every day objects, just as a time capsule would do. Some of these bring those times back, like the display of the daily food ration for an adult in 1945 -- today it would not even qualify as a small snack! And so the story goes: How a society so thoroughly devastated gradually developed into one of the richest countries in the world. It becomes clear that the development was far more turbulent than most of us know, and could have been derailed several times.

Equal space is given to the developments in eastern Germany, which would be less familiar to most visitors.

The museum is free as is the audio guide.","Written February 9, 2013"

The collection is huge, and the exhibits interesting, but, information wise, it was a let down. My German is touchy, so I was very frustrated with the lack of any other Language in the displaycases.

A modern hands-on approach, the constant endeavour to update and complete the exhibition as well as highly interesting additional exhibitions ranging from political cartoons to the highly competitive relationship in sports between FRG and GDR or German pop-music, the museum is a constant source of delight, education and interest. For the over 40s the museum evokes uncounted memories, for the younger generations it provides an essential and unique opportunity to see what the postwar history of this country has been.

The write up was helpful and helped make my decision to go here.

This museum is centered around the rebuilding of Germany after World War II. It starts out with Hitler being declared ead and progresses from that point to the removal of the Berln Wall. There are many artifacts to see which were also interesting.

Most of the signage on the dislays were written in German, however, there were some signs that were in English. Even still, if you take the time to look at what you're seeing, you can still get an understanding of what was going on. It wasn't until I was nearing the end when I saw people being guided with headphones on. It might be worth checking to see if they have headphone guided tours in your language. I may call to see and go back if they do.

I didn't notice if they had food nor a restroom but I would guess they did.

This museum is free and would be well worth it if you had to pay. Enjoy your time here, I did.","Written November 7, 2011"

I am awful when it comes to history and found it fascinating to see the history of Germany since the war. They did a great job of portraying West Germany on one side and East Germany on the other.

Germany,Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,Best museum I've ever visited,"I visited this museum soon after it opened in 1997 when some German friends with whom I was staying were keen to see it.

After travelling through 36 countries and seeing some awesome museums and galleries along the way, this is still the best museum I've ever visited.

In 1997 you could get English guide books/ audio tours which you'll need if your German is basic.

If you want an overview of what's happened in Germany since WWI with the rise of the Third Reich, WWII, Berlin, The Cold War, reunification etc this place will give you a fascinating account.

As a foreign tourist it would be easy to be impressed by the way they cover it all. However, my German friends were absolutely blown away by it as well. That spoke volumes to me.

Make sure that you have a look at the Swiss town of Schaffhausen - it's a staging point for the Rheinfells ‚Äì Europe‚Äôs largest waterfalls & is less than an hour's drive (you can also brag that you have visited Switzerland!

I also recommend the Birnau church which is nestled on the foreshore of Lake Constance. It‚Äôs a Baroque style building built in the mid 18th Century ‚Äì very impressive! From there it's only a short drive to the Stilthouse Museum. Here you virtually travel back in time to the Stone and Bronze ages, thanks to the unique museum which showcases reconstructed stilt houses belonging to the natives of this region between approximately 4300 BC and 800 BC.

It's also worthwhile to catch the car ferry which runs all the time. We did that from Konstanz (the main town of the region) The 11th-century Konstanz Minster dominates the skyline of Konstanz & is an incredible sight, with an equally impressive interior. The Church‚Äôs tower is an impressive 193 steps to the top (I know because I counted them!) where you get a great view of the town itself - the cobblestoned Old Town, architecture, & the Konstanz harbor all impress.

We invested in a leisure card so all travel across the lake was free - worth it if you're going to be hopping across between towns a lot. Check the Bodensee tourism page for details.

Access to the water was over a stony 'beach' but they were man made walk ways to make getting in the water areas. Buoys mark off the safe area to swim and avoid boats, The water is clear and not too deep so would be safe for children. The bottom of the lake is a bit stony in places and there are patches of weed but it's a beautiful refreshing swim or just lovely to wallow in the shallows over looking the stone age village and watched by the ducks.

On the shore there is a children's playground, grassy areas to sit on with shade from trees, a cafe, toilets and outdoor showers. Slightly further back are some restaurants. The Italian one owned by a family from Sicily did great salads.

Germany,Lake Constance (Bodensee),Beautiful but very busy,"We visited here as we were recommended it by family and friends. The lake is absolutely without a doubt stunning, especially upon sunset on a clear day. However, July is peak holiday season and it felt like half of Europe had decended upon the lake for the holidays. Every ferry was full, the traffic was queued everywhere, car parks were all full by 10am and it was extremely expensive to eat and stay anywhere on the lake. We tried to visit Friedrichschafen but couldn't Park anywhere close enough to walk with two young kids. We tried to drive to Konstance from there but aftern1 hour in the traffic queue and hardly moving we back tracked through the back lanes (encountering 3 million cyclists) to our hotel up in the apple orchards which was fantastic. For dinner we drove around the lakeside villages and found nothing exciting but then using a local website we found the best restaurants are up on the hills above the lake with incredible lake views.

We visited Lindau in the morning at 9am. We got the last carpark and found the village lovely to walk around and explore when it was quieter. We then found a fantastic play park near the train station (basically follow the train line from the station towards the mainland and it's in the park where the trains cross from the island to the mainland). There are lots if cafes and restaurants.

It's a pushbike dream. So any paths and places to cycle on flat ground with stunning lake views. Bike hire places everywhere.

We stayed in a very old Hotel which I am sure now was perhaps a little haunted. ( I don't really believe in all this palaver BUT) The town itself seemed full of old people, I didn't really notice many young couples or children, perhaps it was when we visited. Because of this it didn't have the up beat vibe and I would have thought with the lake it would be full of young water enthusiasts. It was oppressive and I spent a bit of time just at the hotel, this is why I think it felt a little haunted as I was not myself and wanting to explore. Maybe just not a town I enjoyed although I liked all the other places we went.","Written May 17, 2016"

1 passenger: 23 euros (adds +5 euros for every additional co-traveller up to a group of 5)
2 passengers: 28 euros

We started from Heidelberg HBF in the early morning (05.10 am)-> Karlshue, and then via beautiful Black Forest -> Constance HBF. We had a casual walk around the old city of Constance. Then we took a one way ferry to Friedrichshafen (Eur 13). We got down in the town of Meersburg. It is very happening town with nice landscape and all touristic amenities. We had a beer and a nice walk. Then took the next ferry to Friedrichshafen. The view from the boat was awesome. On one side, the spring colours while on the other-side there was the fantastic view of the snow covered Alps. We arrived Friedrichshafen in an hour. This is also modern town. With many shopping areas and nice restaurants. We spent some time there and took the train back to Heidelberg via Stuttgart.",

The ferry left about every 10-15mins so no real waiting, the feet took about 20mins

The lake is crystal clear and you can see the Snow on the mountains in the background

Constance is a very beautiful town and the lake front was very beautiful, it was early spring when we visited but I would suggest that in summer it would be amazing

Walked around town which was very nice and the people around town seemed friendly enough

Would highly recommend the ferry and a walk around Constance",
Germany,Lake Constance (Bodensee),Picturesque views all round and great transport links,"Crossing the lake by ferry gives beautiful views but more important is how much time is saved compared to driving round. The trains are synchronised with the ferries at Romanshorn and this is absolutely the best way to Friedrichshafen - or most of the east coast of the lake - from the UK. Fly to Zurich, direct fast trains from Zurich Airport to Romanshorn, ferry straight across the middle of the lake, Romanshorn to Friedrichshafen. Good food and drink on the ferry.
There's also a variety of leisure cruises and an Adventure Pass to explore the area. Search for ""Bodensee"" online.

The lake was too cold for our liking to take a swim but very pretty with lots of boats and sailboats. We stayed two nights. We were on a nine day car trip through Bavaria and Prague. This was our second stop. We had a bit of jet lag so we were able to really enjoy a couple of relaxing days before resuming the rest of our tour.

Cyclists are the road kings here which we loved and I was impressed by the whole green approach to life. water is safe to swim in. Food is amazing even if the menus are a little tricky to decipher.

We perhaps took a bit of chance in the early weeks of off season on the third week of October. Luckily for us, everything worked out perfectly. No wrecks, no rain, no flat tires. It was misty for a few mornings, but this proved to be no problem. While we layered up with clothing, by Noon we were down to a long sleeve shirt. If you've done any research, by now you know that you visit Germany, Switzerland and Austria on the tour. Austria lasts about an hour, but you can say you were there. :) To say the people were friendly is an understatement. Every time we had our faces buried in the map to find our way, someone came up and asked if we needed help. I suppose we could have had a GPS, but finding our way old school was part of the fun/challenge. Not to carry on for too long, to sum it up, we had a great time. There was one half day of bad weather, but we made the best of it going to Lucerne for the day by train. Luckily, after ducking into an Irish pub for lunch we came out and the skies cleared up. I would highly recommend this trip for anyone who enjoys amazing views, sunshine, the smell of the earth and many changing landscapes (country, city, park land). There were a couple hills on the second half of the first day, other than that, it was quite manageable for the non-athlete. If there's any criticism, there were a few challenges getting out of a couple destinations (Konstanz and Radolfzell) to pick up the trail. Also, the trail is well marked, but there were a few moments of confusion here and there. our mantra was 'follow the water'. Also, we hit the road by 9:30/10:00 each day. It seemed like the first three days we were pushing it to get to the next stop, riding by the moonlight and light of the bikes.

Germany,Lake Constance (Bodensee),If only Steve McQueen had made it!!,"We have flown in to Friedrichshafen on many occasions - and have therefore seen the Bodensee from the air, but had never actually walked around the town or seen the lake-front. On this occasion, as we were with a friend who was born in Lindau, on Lake Constance, and, as it was the week of the Culture Fair in Friedrichshafen, we decided to visit the town and explore. We saw as much as we could in the four/five hours that we were there, but we missed so much as there is so much to see. The lake-front itself is full of cafes and bars and the views across the lake to Switzerland are quite fantastic, given the amount of sailing boat and ferry activity. Add to this the Zeppelin airships and the twin-engined Dorniers which pass overhead every half-hour or so and the whole place comes alive. We were lucky to be there during the week the culture fair was in town so the whole seafront was alive with stalls selling all manner of goods, street entertainers, temporary bars and food outlets, so it was pretty magical. I understand that this fair takes place during the first week in August each year and I would suggest that you book this week to stay in, or near, Friedrichshafen as I can guarantee that you will not be bored. We will certainly return as we want to see the Dornier Museum and the Zeppelin Museum, and, also, to sample again the wonderful friendly atmosphere that exists in all the lake-front bars and restaurants.If you come prepared, you can also swim in the lake, which, my wife tells me, is quite warm in August! So, if I had been Steve McQueen and had managed to leap my motorcycle over the wire and escape to Switzerland, and knowing what I know now, I would have been tempted to cross the Bodensee and return to Germany - at least for a week in August!!","Written August 6, 2014"

Germany,Lake Constance (Bodensee),"So beautiful, so relaxing","I have traveled through much of Germany but had never been to the Bodensee. I would suggest this to anyone who wants to take a little time to relax, sit by the lake or go for long walks. The surroundings are beautiful with wine vineyards on one side and the lake on the other. We stayed at a family owned ""inn"" or maybe we would call it a "" B&B"" called the Pension Hardthof. I can't find it on Tripadvisor to review it but it was wonderful. A little on the rustic side but very comfortable and priced quite nicely. It was only 35 euros a night with breakfast! They don't take credit cards and you have to call the owner and book the rooms. Very old school but well worth the effort. They have their own private beach on the Lake which is no longer allowed for new land owners. An older gentleman runs it and seems to really enjoy all of the guests coming and going. He does not speak English though, so be warned. It's a good walk, about 7 km to Meersburg but is good exercise and a very scenic walk. I did that one day and took the Meersburg castle tour. One day we rented bicycles and rode around the lake through Austria and then to Switzerland. We then took a ferry back to Germany. It was a beautiful ride with the Alps in the distance. We basically rode through farmland. Be sure to check the ferry schedule before going because we almost missed the last ferry and would have had to stay in Switzerland overnight or take a couple trains to get back to Germany.","Written July 16, 2014"

Germany,Lichtentaler Allee,Beautiful,This is a beautiful part of Baden-Baden. Lovely walk with beautiful buildings and nice views. Well worth a visit.,
Germany,Lichtentaler Allee,on a sunny day in April,"It was a sunny day in April with many trees and shrubs in bloom, so not surprisingly there were quite a few people strolling along this pedestrian avenue by the small river Oos, even on a Monday. It starts at the Goetheplatz by the theater and then goes in a southernly direction on the left bank of the Oos.

One passes several interesting buildings along the way like the Kulturhaus, the Staatliche Kunsthalle with the attached modern Museum Frieder Burda. On the other side several grand hotels can be seen like the Brenner's Park Hotel. The path is surfaced and there are several footbridges crossing the small river. The best for me - and probably for many others as well - were the beautiful trees, at their best now in spring, like Magnolias, Flowering Dogwoods or Double-flowered Cherry Trees, while in the meadows Narcissus showed their pretty head. Too early though it was for the Rose Garden in the G√∂nneranlage on the river's right hand side",

It was quiet and safe. We walked into town probably a dozen times. Sometimes in the early morning, sometimes late at night. There were always others around on foot or on bikes, even occasionally in carriages. We ALWAYS felt safe and serene. We could have driven and parked in Baden-Baden but we always chose to walk, even if we were tired from a day‚Äôs exploring. It was that enjoyable.

Germany,Lichtentaler Allee,"Romance in the rain, beauty in any season.","Spring is always a little early in this lovely sheltered valley where Baden-Baden is situated. No wonder, with the volcanic springs, the Romans had established the first spa here 2000 years ago, for their tired legionnaires who needed R&R.
In the last 200 years, it served as the ""summer residence"" for European hobnobs, when Paris got too hot & muggy. The famous Casino (closed for gambling under Bismarck in 1871 and only reopened under Hitler), had been a gathering spot for society and travelers all along. -- So, take a walk along the Oos, right from the Trinkhalle, past the Casino with the Collonades, walk by the gorgeous Theater (and get tickets to spend an evening inside), don't overlook the new Museum LAB, the adjacent Staatliche Kunsthalle, the almost-new Burda Museum for contemporary art. -- All this incredible offering in this small-sized town!
Continue perambulating along the Lichtenthaler Allee, and see the posh Brenner's Park Hotel. Stop in for a drink on the terrace (do the gentlemen still need to wear a tie to be admitted for cocktail hour? better check). Keep going, keep walking or bicycling. Cross the next street and pass the Dahlia gardens, more hotels, and don't give up until you reach the other end, where the actual Lichtenthal begins. Now you've reached the active nunnery, the Kloster Lichtenthal. You may be able to walk inside the medieval courtyard. Go into the convent store, and purchase some of the nuns' liquors. All your ailments will be cured! Oh, and stop into the chapel for Evensong. You will never see the nuns. But you will hear their plaintive voices, singing the Gregorian chants, each hour.","Written April 2, 2018"

Germany,Lichtentaler Allee,Well-kept man-made park with little nature in the winter,"This place looks like a man-made park in the town of Baden-Baden. It is essentially a street (accessible to cars, max 30 km/hr), and there are recreational paths along the sides. It is quaint, but not much to see here. I accidentally drove on top of it and along the whole thing, and felt really awkward the whole minute it took to drive along it at 30 km/hr. Perhaps if you get out and walk and take your time, then it would be nice, but from what I saw from my car, it wasn't worth trying to find parking and walking around.

It doesn't feel like you're in nature. You won't see any of the cool Black Forest/Schwarzwald trees you hear about, but maybe that was my fault for assuming they would be there. Perhaps in the summer, spring, or fall there is more to see with flowers and whatnot, but in January, it doesn't seem to be much more than manicured grass covered in snow and ice.

If you get lost, you could try asking the locals, and although many could not speak English that well, they tried to help me the best that they could.

Off the beaten path tip: When putting ""76530 Baden-Baden"" in Google Maps‚Äîinstead of Licthentaler Allee‚Äîyou will be brought to the middle of nowhere. I kept going.

Eventually I reached an area where others were parked so I decided to station myself there. I was at the surrounding area of the Baden-Baden Golf Course, which was actually a nicer, winter wonderland-like stroll than Lichtentaler Allee.

Germany,Freiburg Cathedral,Exploring Freiburg,"Freiburg is a nice place to visit. It is the summer capital of Germany. Their surroundings are clean and people are friendly and helpful. We visited the place during the week of heat wave but it didn‚Äôt stop us from exploring its beautiful landmarks. Their architectural sites were impressive. They also have this canal where a clear and clean water flows and children would love to play with their toy boats or you can also soak your feet to cool down. They say, when you soak your feet into that canal water you will marry a local (I don‚Äôt know if this is true!).

Freiburg is known for its scenic beauty called Black Forest. Black Forest offers loads of activities for children and the whole family. They have cable cars going uphill where you will see the entire town of Freiburg. If you are into hiking then it is a place to visit. Another place to see is called Titisee. You will find a beautiful lake where you can go on a boat and paddle around the lake. You can also rent a bike and explore the place. If you are a fan of cuckoo clocks then you can buy the best ones in Titisee. They also have nice shops to buy unique souvenirs.

Also, Freiburg is a borderline between France and Switzerland. It is just a train ride going to either of them. If you plan to visit Freiburg, don‚Äôt forget to include France and Switzerland as part of your must see places.",

If you have kids with you this will keep them entertained for awhile. When Freiburg was bombed the cathedral and stained glass windows were saved! Admittance is free and well worth the visit.","Written May 27, 2018"

Germany,Freiburg Cathedral,If you like Cathedrals you will want to visit this one,"This is a huge cathedral with some amazing architecture. If you like wandering around historic or religious building you will want to look around this one. It is a working cathedral so you can go to the services if you wish, or if that is not your cup of tea then you can just wander around when it is less busy. It does not cost anything and you can spend a good hour just looking about inside and out. Of course as it is in the main city centre of Freiburg you can then visit the excellent shopping areas afterwards.","Written May 8, 2018"
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),CLOSED FOR REPAIRS,Can't say I blame them. The crowds are so low that this is probably the easiest time for repair but I was hugely disappointed. I had checked and did not see any warning or I would not have gone there on this trip.

Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),"Didn't expect it, but was well worth the wait","The climb up the hill is actually quite tough, as it is pretty steep. We didn't really expect this and were not that well prepared. I think it took us around 45 minutes to walk up the hill. Don't worry though, there is also a shuttle bus that drives up and down every couple of minutes. This costs a couple of euro's, one way. You could decided to take the shuttle up, and walk down.

Once we arrived at the top, where the bridge is, we were very confused by all the people standing in line. It turned out, they were actually waiting to enter the bridge. Never in a million years, would I've have thought that there could be a queue this long for a bridge.

We almost walked right back down, but since the climb up was so steep we didn't want it to be in vain. Also, we didn't really have any other plans for the day, anyway.
So we waited in line too. It took us maybe around an hour to actually get to the entrance of the bridge.

It is free to enter, but there is some one supervising so that not too many people enter at once. The bridge is divided into to sections, so everyone sticks to walking on the right side. You can exit the bridge on the other side, but I am not sure where that mountain path will take you. Most people walk up one way, and just walk right back down the same path.

It was well worth the wait, as the views are absolutely stunning. You'll get a magnificent view of Neuschwanstein castle (that we unfortunately didn't get to enter) and there is a gigantic waterfall. As the bridge is really high up, you'll also get a beautiful view over the mountains and the valley.

We were a bit annoyed by the line at first, but in the end it was one of the activities that we were most excited about! Would highly recommend taking the time to wait your turn to enter this bridge.","Written September 13, 2020"

Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Keep Going,"This bridge has one of the best vantages of Neuschwanstein Castle.

Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Marienbr√ºcke - worth the hassle.,"The bridge is about a 15-minute walk from the castle. We took a bus from the parking lot down below, and it dropped us off right in front of the bridge. The bridge was in good condition as it has been recently refurbished. It really is THE BEST view of the castle. IF you can get a view. The only downside is the crowd. We went in June, so it might have been worse than in, say, February...but having to jostle for the view makes for a less than relaxing experience. Everyone wants their photos (including us, sorry), but I would have foresaken photos for a longer time enjoying the view in peace.

I do recommend taking the trail right next to the bridge. It goes right down to the base of the falls. It‚Äôs steps, not a gentle slope, but it was much less crowded and a lovely short nature walk.

Final thoughts: Don‚Äôt skip it. Go early in the morning and wait for the crowd to die down a little before you go on the bridge. It‚Äôs really a great view and not far from the village if you bus it.",

Visiting in March 2019 and I have a few questions about Marienbruke as I have a troublesome ankle.
1. Can you ride a bus back down or is the service only one way. (Ie after drop off is your only option to walk back down to the castle)
2. How often do the buses travel to the bridge.
3. How far/long is the bus stop from the actual bridge.
4. Is it a difficult uphill walk from the bus stop.
5. Is it suitable/safe for 9/10 year old kids.
6. Does the bus operate in March.
Many thanks for any advice. Been wanting to visit here since I was a child but want to get a prepared as possible given my reduced mobility.

Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),The real Highlight!,"Since photography is not permitted inside Neuschwanstein Castle and using a drone to take aerial photos is prohibited is the whole area the view from Mary‚Äôs Bridge is the most important photo stop during your visit to the castle. Furthermore this is the spot where the most famous and iconic image was taken that pops up on your screen as soon as you type ‚ÄúNeuschwanstein + images‚Äù into your search engine.

There is no entrance fee to enter or to pass the bridge and you can spend as much time to enjoy the view as you like. But be aware that it can be very crowded on weekends or during vacation times (school break). Due to safety reasons the number of people on the bridge is regulated by security guards. That means at peak times you have to que up. On my last visit (a regular Sunday) we had to wait in line for more than 30 minutes! So keep that in mind when visiting on one of the aforementioned days.

Please note that there is another viewpoint nearby. If you follow the trail at the other end of the bridge and turn left after a few metres you can take photos from a slightly different angle. But be aware that the path is not really safe and requires good footwear (hiking boots are recommended here)!

The far end of the bridge also marks the beginning of a beautiful hike through the P√∂llatschlucht, but again: hiking boots are recommended on the trail.

The bridge and the trail are closed during bad weather conditions! Check the internet site for more and up-to-date information.

In my opinion, the view from the bridge is the real highlight during a visit of Neuschwanstein Castle, since its interior is not more spectacular than many other castles in Germany. I have been inside twice and it was ok, but the bridge with the great view never ceases to amaze me. What I mean is that it makes sense to visit the castle anyway, even if tickets for the tour are sold out.","Written November 13, 2018"
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Closed for construction during our visit,"Really gutted that the bridge was closed during our visit (just means I'll need to come back!) but my tour guide was lucky enough to know a spot where I could get a shot of the bridge and castle which is better than nothing. If the bridge is closed when you are there walk from the castle around to the entrance to the bridge and continue walking down the hill. It takes you down the gorge a little and allows you a shot with the bridge and castle together. I would've been very disappointed if he didn't know about this. You can get the shuttle bus up to the bridge entrance or walk up to the castle, past the castle and along a path. When planning your trip check on the website when it is open, I am sure it is closed sometimes in the winter also!",
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Please make it!!,"If you are planning to visit Neuschwanstein Castle take touristic shuttle bus which drops you off near Mary's Bridge (clearly signed), leaving you a step, 10 minutes downhill walk to the castle - so be sure to see the view from Mary's Bridge before hiking down to the castle.
But anyway you can make Mary's Bridge before or after Neuschwanstein tour, climb to bridge to marvel at Ludwig's castle, just as Ludwig II did. This bridge was quite an enginnering accomplishment 100 years ago.(Access to the bridge is closed in bad winter weather, snow, ice, hard rain etc).
The trail connecting Neuschwanstein to Mary's Bridge is also scenic. with view back on castle's facade in one direction, and classic views of Hohenschwangau - perched on its little hill between lakes, with cut-glass peaks on the horizon - in the other.
The view from Mary's Bridge over valley is breathtaking, don't miss this additional free rewarding attraction to your visit castles tours. Walk from shuttle station not more than 7 minutes little uphill and your explore the views from the bridge at your own peace.",

We didn't bother doing a tour of the inside of the castle, instead we enjoyed the views from this bridge and walking around the outside. We were not disappointed, we really enjoyed the experience... and aside from parking, it was free!

Arrived at 11.30am yesterday and the town was beginning to get quite busy. Parking 4 (P4) was full so we parked in P3. ‚Ç¨6 cash collected by an attendant on entering. We walked up to Marienbr√ºcke following the yellow hiking trail signs at the start of the path to the castle. It's a trail on the right hand side as you start the ascent. It‚Äôs a decent gradient but not many people and well shaded. I carried our toddler but would definitely recommend a baby carrier / backpack, as it was further and steeper than I expected. The trail signs say 40 minute walk.

There was a line of people at the bridge but it moved quickly. Following advice from other TA reviewers we went straight to the far end of the bridge where it was not crowded and we had plenty of space and time to take photos. The castle really is something special to see.

After the bridge we followed signs to the castle and got great views over the surrounding area, then walked back down to the town. There‚Äôs a separate trail leading directly down to P3 just after the area where the horse and carriages depart.
We left around 1.30pm and it was a lot busier by this time. It was a great visit, definitely recommend going there and you don‚Äôt need to go inside to enjoy the castle.","Written July 26, 2018"
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Must go!,"So worth the hike. We were lucky in the sense that the tickets into the castle were all sold out so we decided to hike up here instead and were treated to the most spectacular views of the castle. The bridge itself looks rickety but clearly very sturdy as many visitors walk on it every single day. A walk to the other end is highly recommended for the best views of the castle from a different angle and the area around. We went on a day of heavy downpour and wind which just enhanced our experience. I am afraid of heights so stuck to the rail but once you get past the initial fear, the views are gorgeous.
You can park in any of the lots in Shwangau and start walking. Wear comfortable walking shoes and enjoy the walk up.","Written July 25, 2018"
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Walk to the end of the bridge,"Marienbrucke is just 10mins walk (uphill) from Neuschwanstein castle. The views provided from this bridge are famous. In my opinion, the views from up on this bridge are better than any view inside the castle (and you're not allowed to take photos on the inside anyway).

Once you get onto the bridge, don't be afraid to walk right down to the other end - the views are just as good. People often stop as soon as they get onto the bridge to take photos here, but this is the busiest area and you won't get great photo-taking opportunities.

Not for those who are afraid of heights. The bridge is very sturdy and safe but there are wooden planks that bend and give the impression that they are going to break (they won't). I saw lots of people who could not get onto the bridge because of this.","Written July 20, 2018"
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),"For fewer tourists, cross the bridge and hike up beyond it","This bridge spans the gorge above Neuschwanstein and provides excellent views of the castle. The bridge is packed with tourists most of the day, but if you cross it and hike about 5-10 minutes up the hill beyond it, you get (even better) views and fewer people. If you take the bus up from Schwangau, it drops you off very close to the bridge. Otherwise, it's a 15 minute hike (uphill) from the castle.",
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Amazing,"If you don't fear heights or have a phobia of heights, then this bridge is a must. Beautiful bridge with a stunning view. You can take a lot of photos with the whole castle of Neuschwanstein. Take care the bridge is so narrow and might seam scary but it is a great experience.","Written July 5, 2018"
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),It is worth the short hike to take in the castle!,"I started to walk to this bridge with my friends before our 15:55 scheduled castle tour, but the line looked so long we worried we would miss the tour. That turned out to be a good call because the crowds had really thinned out by the time we headed this way. It was 17:00 when we reached the bridge. It was a short, easy walk, especially compared to getting to the castle! My only regret was that I didn't take the time to really look at the bridge itself and take in things other than the castle. However I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated being here!","Written July 4, 2018"

We got great shots before the fog made visibility awful.","Written June 14, 2018"

This time it was a perfect, sunny, warm day in April 2018 and the view was spectacular.

To get to the bridge, you can walk up from the castle (about 10 minutes) or you can ride the bus up from the ticket office for a small fare (less than 2 Euros).

The bridge is really cool and most people don't realize it's older than Neuschwanstein castle. The view of the castle and the countryside is excellent and the view down to the rushing rivers in the canyon below are also very spectacular.

The walk up to the castle is kind of strenuous (20-30 minutes), my 6 year old wanted to take lots of breaks and tried to get us to carry her. I would imagine the hike up would be even more exhausting with a stroller.
Once we walked past the castle it was about another 15-20 minute walk to the bridge. Which was also quite steep BUT with amazing views along the way if the lake and the valley. Once we were by the bridge, there was a line to get on.

Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Viewed from a distance - closed for repairs,"Marienbr√ºcke (or Mary‚Äôs Bridge in English), is a bridge located just above the famous Neuschwanstein Castle in Hohenschwangau, Germany. The bridge is located about 70 miles southwest of Munich in Bavaria and can be easily visited using the train and a short bus ride. This bridge allows you to easily cross from one side of the Pollat River Gorge to the other. The bridge is about a 30 minute walk (uphill) from the town of Hohenschwangau.

I visited Mary‚Äôs Bridge with my wife on a Sunday afternoon in mid-May and enjoyed looking at the bridge from about 100 yards below it (since it was temporarily closed for repairs). We had read about the views of the castle from the center of the bridge and were disappointed that it was closed for repairs. The views of the bridge from below were still pretty good as the river gorge is beautiful.

What I didn't expect (and what my review's title refers to) were some stunning views of Schloss Hohenschwangau, the mountains, and the lake at the first view point on the way to the bridge.

Also, in some reviews, there's statements made about the ease of the walk. It was manageable, certainly, for me. But the grade is quite steep in a few sections, so if you're uneasy on your legs, I would recommend really good soles and a walking stick.","Written October 12, 2016"

Buses can also directly bring you here depending on the road condition, which was closed when we went there.
To get to the castle it costs 12 euros, however one could get to the bridge free of cost without having to get to the castle.
The costs to reach upto the castle is 6 euros in horse carriage, 1.8 euros in bus and to come down its 3 euros in horse carriage and 1 euro in bus.
The bridge is super crowded and is manned by a security personnel not to overturn its limit of weight it can handle.

Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Views are epic!,"If you ever visit Neuschwanstein Castle - do not miss opportunity to view it from the best angle.
There are 2 possibilities getting up there - first is ascending by the shuttle bus, second is a 10 minute walk from castle, depends of your round trip choice. If you choose to get into the castle by bus - you will not have to walk, the bridge is just few meters from bus station. However, the bus was not operating during our visit due to road restoration works, so we had to go from the castle side, but the walk was short and the alley path is beautiful.
The bridge is always crowded and overloaded with tourists regardless season/time, but the views are worth the hassle and photos are timeless.
Tip - for traveling with a small children - the location is easily accessed with a stroller, but don't bring the stroller to the bridge itself - you will have hard time to leave, people won't move at any cost, just leave it outside the bridge and bring children with you.
This is a ""must visit"" location.",

The bridge is made of metal with wooden flooring . Tourists have placed some Lover's Locks (padlocks engraved with names of lovers) on the bridge, which we as a couple did. It is very sturdy as it is filled with tourists taking pictures from one end to the other, and was never scary to stand on. There are water falls streaming below. Past the bridge there is a hiking path which can be explored. There is a plaque which explains the bridge's history, which traces back all the way to King Ludwig (creator of the castles) and their treks here as a family. The bridge was named after King Ludwig's mother, Marie the Queen

We have the splendid view of the castle and waterfall all to ourself at the bridge. No squeezing, no waiting and mostly importantly no ""excuse me"" I need to take a photo. We have lots of space and time at the bridge because we were there at 6:15pm. By 7pm, the whole area was like ghost town, all tour coaches and tourist vanished.

Its a good 15 mins walk with lots of fresh air from the castle to the bridge. You'll glimpse the spectacular panorama view of Hohenschwangau, the lake, the waterfall and the castle. Take the bus up and stroll down if you prefer a less physically demanding route.",

The view is beautiful but I only gave it a ""Poor"" as it is usually jam packed with tourists elbowing each other to get pictures. etc. I am surprised the bridge can hold that many people without collapsing. It is bad primarily because that is where the buses drop people off for walk down to Neuschwanstein. The walk to/from the castle is pleasant and if it were not for the tourists the bridge would be a fitting climax to the walk, suspended high over the gorge with tree covered slopes it should be a restful and peaceful experience.",

The bridge itself its small and gets quite crowded at some times but if you have patience you can take some really go pictures.

Also, the road on the other side of the bridge would take (after an hour or so), to the end of a cliff where you can take a beautiful photo from the top. Also an amazing chance, if you are fit enough to do it.

To access the bridge is not that difficult, been just 15 minutes away from the bus stop of the main castle. You can also walk from the ticket office and it would take you around 40 minutes or so.

Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Just amazing!!!!,"I visited this attraction with amazement. There is a road that winds around the castle of Neuschwanstein and it is the road that leads to the magical bridge.
Once arrived near this it has been so difficult start to walk through it, the bridge is small but safe, but nevertheless it is suspended more than 50 meters high and the wind currents are strong enough.
I can guarantee that the panoramic view of 360 degrees is the best thing about the trip here, great. Beyond the bridge, the trail continues, but I was stuck here to admire this fantastic beauty. From here the view of the castle is really exceptional.",
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Awesome view of the Neuschwanstein Castle,"This is where most photos of the castle were taken. The bridge is quite high and small. My partner and I visited in mid-May and there were quite a lot of people. I cant imagine how crowded it is in the summer.

We went to the bridge twice - during sunset and during the day. I must say, during sunset is MUCH better. If you're staying in Hohenschwangau, I highly recommend to go there during sunset. The view is simply spectacular and very quiet. There were 2 people at the bridge, then they left and then we were alone. We were sitting on the cliff enjoying the view.",
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Beautiful,"Amazing views of the city and lake from the bridge. Beautiful castle, little waterfall, mountains and nature.",
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),MUST NOT MISS!!!,"Best time to visit:
1. Summer, when the sun still shines brightly at 7pm.
2. After lunch, late afternoon when all the tourist are done with their tours.

We have the splendid view of the castle and waterfall all to ourself at the bridge. No squeezing, no waiting and mostly importantly no ""excuse me"" I need to take a photo. We have lots of space and time at the bridge because we were there at 6:15pm. By 7pm, the whole area was like ghost town, all tour coaches and tourist vanished.

Its a good 15 mins walk with lots of fresh air from the castle to the bridge. You'll glimpse the spectacular panorama view of Hohenschwangau, the lake, the waterfall and the castle. Take the bus up and stroll down if you prefer a less physically demanding route.",
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Beautiful view but full of tourists,"This bridge overlook's Neuschwanstein Castle. The view is beautiful but I only gave it a ""Poor"" as it is usually jam packed with tourists elbowing each other to get pictures. etc. I am surprised the bridge can hold that many people without collapsing. It is bad primarily because that is where the buses drop people off for walk down to Neuschwanstein. The walk to/from the castle is pleasant and if it were not for the tourists the bridge would be a fitting climax to the walk, suspended high over the gorge with tree covered slopes it should be a restful and peaceful experience.",

There were hundreds of people lined up at the ticket office to try to visit the castles that day. We hadn't pre-purchsed tickets and decided to just walk up and see the castles from the outside, and i'm certainly glad I did. When you see the beautiful photos of Neuschwanstein nestled in the mountains, most of those photos are taken from this bridge. We went here first and got the most amazing photos of not only the castles, but some incredible natural beauty as well. It cost us nothing! From the bridge we could see people on the balcony of the castle. While they lined up and paid to get photos of a mountain and a bridge, we got the actual castle photos. Talking to people at the bottom of the hill later, many had intended to go to the bridge but ran out of time waiting for tickets and castle tours. I think we made the better decision.","Written May 1, 2015"
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Excellent view of the castle,There is a bit of a walk up to the bridge from the castle and it is a little scary to step out on the bridge which is often packed with tourists... but the view just can't be beat!,
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),"Scary bridge, but amazing views!",The bridge is scary and high but the views can't be beat. I didn't want to go up when it was crowded with tourists so i got up early in the morning and went up around 6:00 am. I drove my car up the narrow winding road and fortunately the buses hadn't started running yet or it would have been a big problem. once at the top there is a parking area where the busses turn around. from there its a short hike up to the bridge. the bridge is also accessible by bus or you can walk up from the front of Neuschwanstein. I highly recommend going up early in the morning before the crowds. I was the only one up there and it was so peaceful and beautiful.,
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Paradise in its truest form,"If you have travelled to Neuschwanstein, you have travelled to see it from this exact spot. Take my word on this. The view on the inside of the castle may disappoint those ardent Disney fans who may have travelled miles ( and hiked till their knees were sore) but if you make it here, it would make every penny you spent worth it.

Friends who had been there before us strongly suggested we go to Marinebr√ºck to see the view from there. Due to excessive ice and snow, the routes to the bridge were closed but many people were still braving all odds to get there.... So we tagged along. It was quiet adventurous for us as we slided, glided and helped each other to the other end and while this was quiet fun for us, I would not advise people travelling with the elderly, sick or pregnant to do this. Kids somehow seemed better than us at balancing and making their way through so guess they are just gifted that way :P

The view from the Marienbr√ºck left me spellbound... It just seemed so pristine and secluded from the hustle-bustle of daily life. The snow-capped peaks of the alps, the pine forest, the waterfalls beneath us and the castle placed like the single most perfect solitaire you have ever seen, in the lap of mother nature at her best.

Skip all that you want but make it a point to make it here. I believe the view here in autumn would be spectacular though I didn't have a chance to be there during that season but would definitely suggest it.

I would definitely suggest anybody going to the castle rather make it to the bridge than go for the inside tour of the castle.","Written March 17, 2015"
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),"If You Can Do It, Do It","Before we toured the castle we hiked (walking would not be the right description) up to the bridge for an awesome (right word) view. If you arrive via the bus it is just up the hill, otherwise if you have slogged up from the village it is further up from the castle to the right. Be aware that this is a world class ""selfie"" paradise for some folks who don't care that they are hogging the bridge (actually a large catwalk), but still a great view of the castle so persevere. I agree that if you are an acrophobiac this might not be the best experience, but it is safe and the panorama is tremendous, especially considering that the interior of the castle doesn't deliver what the exterior promises. See what the travel photos you have been looking at were all about. Hint: if you don't make it, take a photo of one of the posters that are ubiquitous in the area of the castle and say you did it. If nothing else, take a photo of the bridge from the waiting area (courtyard) of the castle. Even that is impressive. Wish I could have done the bridge when the castle was lit up at night.","Written January 9, 2015"
Germany,Queen Mary's Bridge (Marienbrucke),Awesome!,You have to stop by the bridge while you're there for the best views. I suppose we were lucky because a lot of the reviews mention insane crowds on the bridge but we were the only people there when we went in late November around 4 p.m. We had a rental car so perhaps the bus doesn't run that late. Take the hike up the hill past the bridge for an even better view but I wouldn't take kids up there because there are no rails and it's a straight drop off the side of the cliff.,"Written December 13, 2014"

You can imagnine how Ludwig was living up there, forgetting the rest of the world. The restaurant just below the castle, three quarters of the way up offers clean and good rates for rooms.

After the long, strenuous walk up the mountain to Marienbr√ºcke I wanted to make it feel ""worth it"" so I inchwormed my way onto the bridge, sweating all the way. A guy who sensed my obvious trepidation thought it would be funny to bounce up & down on the wooden slats (which responded wobbily) and that was all I needed to scurry back to safety. My 16-year old refused to even get onto the bridge. I wish there was some way to limit access - it was just so crowded it seemed unsafe!

It was a great place to take photos of the castle but also along the hike towards the bridge was a beautiful hike and was also great for other photo opportunities. The hike toward the bridge overlooks the mountains and also the other castle Ludwig castle.
Also if you want to take a smaller trail that leads down to the bottom of waterfall instead of back through Neuschwanstein it is absolutely amazing. This trail is about halfway from the castle to the bridge, you will see that the trail leads down instead of up. The trail leads to the base of the waterfall all the way down to the river that will eventually take you pretty much back into town. At one point the trail actually takes you over the water, as its a small metal walkway attached to the side of the mountain. This walk is only for the summer because of the danger of falling rocks and deep snow during the winter. It was simply amazing.",

It can certainly get crowded (all of Neuschwanstein is crowded), especially in the summer. But we still had no problem getting great pictures. If heights make you queasy, don't look over the edge of the bridge.

Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,Skip museum re-opens 2023/2024,"The museum is basically closed until 2023 or 2024 I was told when I asked where everything else was. There's a ""interim"" exhibit open that is literally one room with a bunch of displays in German and English. You hear construction equipment going full blast the whole time you're in this one room.

If you're taking transit, or even driving, beware of massive roadworks under construction. The bus dropped me (tram #8 not in service now) off next to a construction fence on the road nearby. Hardly any signage in German or English to figure out how to catch a bus back, so I ended up just walking.

The exhibit itself is like similar displays Ive seen throughout german museums when they have a section devoted to the fascist era of Germany. The only difference is that when I go to those other museums I actually see a full museum and that‚Äôs just one part, not the whole 6‚Ç¨ admission..

The old stomping grounds of the nazis is so spread out that it‚Äôs really not worth the effort unless you‚Äôre on a bike.

Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,Under Construction,"The Documentation Center is under construction and there is only one room open. It's informative but not really worth the admission price. I would also not plan to spend more than an hour if that's all you wanted to see. The trail that they have created around the area makes it worth at least a visit. The trail is several miles around the area with sign along the way to give you information about the various sites.

Driving here? There is parking outside the Documentation center in various areas but with the construction it's hard to see. You can also park in the middle of the Kongresshalle. Since it's under construction, be careful of pedestrians and construction debris.",

Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,The crowning jewel for history lovers,"Maybe I am bias because I love history so much, but this was hands down the best place I've ever visited in terms of learning.

The museum is all about the rise and the fall of the Nazi party, and it is evident that a lot of hard work and dedication has gone into making this one of the best places to visit to learn more about this terrible time in human history. It should not be skipped.

Upon entry, which is more than good value for the quality experience (I think we paid ‚Ç¨15 each?), you are given an audio guide by the super friendly and helpful staff. Numerous languages available. You then follow the audio guide around the site.

If you are staying in Nuremberg I'd recommend setting aside at least half a day for this visit. We spent over 4 hours walking around the exhibitions, reading all the information and slowly processing just how awful Hitler's time in power was. I still felt I didn't get chance to see everything due to time, so I'd come back in a heartbeat.

Make sure you explore the grounds around the site. A truly fantastic day out and well done to all those who worked to put this exhibition together.

It is of course possible to begin the visit with the outside areas, but in that case a guided tour may be the best bet.

The museum is an architectural and design achievement in itself and the tour ends on a ramp extending into the middle of the stadium. Unfortunately, it was dark by the time I got to that point... big mistake.

Only problem was that all the writing in the museum is in German so you are totally dependent on the audio guide for information.

Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,Emotional!,"I went to the Documentation Centre expecting to learn more about the history of the Nazi Party and their rise to power and what happened next. It is far more than that! To get here I got the tram from the city centre which terminates right outside the centre.

The museum takes you on a journey through history talking about how Hitler came to power and what happened next including the persecution of the people that Hitler did not like. It takes you through the whole history up to WW2 including the Nuremberg rallies, through the war and on to the aftermath including the trials which were also held in Nuremberg.

Seeing the inside of the Congress Hall and what the original plans were for it is quite chilling but for me one of the most emotional things was the exhibition called Die Gleis which shows a piece of railway track and has grey cards with the names of people who died as a result of the holocaust.

I had the audio tour which I would say is a MUST for your visit as this tells you all about the exhibits.

That way you can literally listen to every single one of them without zoning out or getting bored. The history here is crazy and they do a great job in documenting it. It gives you historical context of the nazi party and their rise to power and the significance of Nuremberg as the city for the rallies.

Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds - Gripping Terror,"Nuremberg, about a 1 hour jaunt from Rothenburg along the Romantic Road, is a city with much to offer, from its cuisine, bustling markets, appealing architecture and fascinating sights. However, it is hard not to attach Nuremberg with the mass rallies of the Nazi party and the ensuing trials that followed. The is a fact which was not easy for the city to deal with, until they decided to use part of the monumental Congress Hall for the Nazi Documentation Center.

As I approached, the Center revealed its tight contemporary design in stark contrast to the colossal Romansh architecture of the Congress Hall itself. This design break-away suggests a separation from old Nazi ways and the modern German era. Next I saw a tall glass metal spike that sticks diagonally out of the entrance, another architectural symbolism that denotes separation. To add more fuel to this break-away motif, the inside of the Doc Center is bleak with exposed brick while the Congress Hall is grandiose. The town went to great efforts to architecturally distance themselves from the Nazi regime.

Really upsetting on entry, was viewing a large gold bust of Hitler, looking like an ugly Charlie Chaplin. In my mind, this man should not be show the dignity one would associate will a statue or artifact. On the other hand, goose stepping soldiers buried in glass coffins embedded in the Doc Centre floor, are footed on by tourists. This seems a more appropriate place for Hitler.

Multiple exhibitions areas, used a combination of mixed media formats to portray the Nazi regime. Its permanent exhibition, titled: FASCINATION AND TERROR, concentrates on the causes, connections and consequences of the Nazi movement, and chronological portrays the bulk work of information provided by the Center.

An adjunct to the revelations of the Center is the ominous stone structure embracing the rally grounds. This where hundreds of thousands Nazi Party supporters gathered to strut their evils and wave they're swastikas. I climbed the stairs of the staging pod where Hitler and his cronies looked out to the fascist mob with approval. The rally grounds have since turned into a park, but the actual rally structure remains.

This stuff is deeply unsettling, but an important part of history. The Doc Center is a big name attraction in Nuremberg, but it is really a reaction attraction. It's the questions that swell up inside you, inspired by the exhibits, that make this experience so personally meaningful. The overall question, however, is alway: 'How could people do this to people'.

So. if you desire information on the Nazism, beyond the History Channel level, done in a professional manner, but with a caveat that what you hear and see might be disconcerting to you...try the Documentation Center Nazi Rally Grounds........Gripping Terror.","Written October 6, 2019"

The museum's website recommends it is not for people under 14. Indeed there are a few graphic photos, but it's not like visiting a horror show. Very few images are ones that would be bothersome for children.

Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,perfect name!,"The Documentation Center really lives up to its name. If you still don't know about Hitler and the Nazis, or know very little, you'll be an expert after visiting this museum.

It's a walking tour with help from an ingenuous audio gadget. Arranged in detail as it happened, from the beginning to the end of the rise to power of the Nazis, to the horrors of the holocaust, and then the Nuremberg trials.

It's fitting to have this museum in Nuremberg as it's where the Nazis annual huge parade rallies took place - a grand display of the Nazi power and the Third Reich that was supposed to last a thousand years! In reality though, it lasted less than three decades of death and destruction.

The actual videos made the events come alive again in memory, and some display are poignant - reliving the last days of the millions of lives unnecessarily lost. The visit was both an eye opener and gut wrenching, and altho I know a lot about it, there were a lot that I didn't. The railroad tracks especially was a very moving display.

Near the end of the tour, there's a view of the inside of the Roman-like arena, which was designed grandly to inspire awe but now is just a storage area for some vehicles and construction materials.

Out the side of the building is a man made lake with lots of ducks in winter frolic - perfect place to take awhile and reflect on everything you've just heard and seen.

Yes you shouldn't pass up the chance to visit - the experience is surreal.

Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,Powerfully Explains the How More Than the Why,"My wife and I took the short tram ride from the city center to the NS Documentation center on our 17 day vacation of Germany. Transportation to the area was easy and efficient. Upon arrival we decided to walk the lap around the lake that is next to it to have lunch, see the zeppelin field and take it all in. We had a great lunch at Gutmann am Dutzendteich beer garden (it was delicious!). We continued our walk around the lake, laughed at the giant swans people were renting to paddle around the lake, and ultimately ended up at the NS Documentation center.

This center drives home the point of ""never again"". It explains, with a provided audio guide, the ""how"" of when Hitler rose to power. Only by understanding how it happened can a people really prevent it in the future. It took about an hour to walk around the lake, with another hour and a half for the visit (we listened to almost all displays).

This was a totally fascinating and well-presented examination of the beating heart of the Nazi regime, chock full of photos, memorabilia, and videos in the language of your choice. I don't know how they could have done this any better.

Walking through the museum is a labyrinth of chambers, passages, and walkways, with a wealth of documentation of Nazi culture, social life and the Nuremberg rallies.

My one, primary frustration with the Documentation Center was that it was practically impossible to find Zeppelin Field. They keep it hidden. If you want to get to Zeppelin Field, you had better schedule it in advance, because you can't just casually walk onto it. Zeppelin is close to the Zentrum, but not quite adjacent to it.

It is not conspicuous but if you want to bypass the paid exhibits and just see the structures, you can exit the building and walk around the adjacent lake using something like a Rick Steve''s narrative. You can walk into the court yard of the unfinished colesium, onto the ""great road/street"", and onto zeppelin parade field. Zepelin is well intacted and you walk around some of the structures. After the Zepelin field, you can then continue around the lake towards the Doc center. Along the way, you will encounter two beer gardens. The first one on the left, opens at 430, we did not try so can''t comment. The second one Gutenberg's was on the right side closer to the transporation pick up points.

A rather long wait to pay, despite only being 4th in the queue....due to the cashier dealing with a gentleman buying books....maybe an idea to have more than one cashier.....only ‚Ç¨6 entrance fee (there are concessions)...and you get a weird audio guide device that you have to hold to your ear like a phone.

Onto the displays, which are all numbered...you punch the number into the audio guide to get a detailed narration of what you are looking at.

This museum has lots to see and listen to, so give yourself at least 90 mins to go round. It is very informative and tells you all about the rise and fall of the Nazi party under Hitler.......and you will leave feeling that this type of evil lunacy must never be allowed to happen again.

WARNING....it is VERY hot inside the museum....there is no air conditioning...so take water!!!

There is also a suspended platform (shown in one of the attached pictures) that takes you out into what would have been the Congress Hall of the Nazi Party....its size is jaw dropping!

A must do visit if WWII is something you have an interest in......or if it is just for learning.",

A fantastic and informative place to visit and even had signed documents from those that committed atrocities, you will need a good few hours here and there's also audio guides available which helps unfortunately on some things it doesn't work or if a video is playing it automatically plays that rather than what you're looking at.

Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,Informative exhibition and excellently designed musuem,"I spent about 2.5/3 hrs visiting the Documentation Centre and had to skip parts of the audio guide as I was a bit pressed for time. The audio is pretty comprehensive although about half of it is not specific to the Party Rallies so if you are already well versed on Nazi Germany you can skip those parts. The design of the museum (textures, lighting etc) was great. Afterwards we walked around the local area and followed the signboards to see parts of the old rally grounds. There is not much left apart from the KongressHalle and Zeppelinfeld but it is worth it to take a walk around the lake and see these.",

Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,Sobering.,This was one of the reasons I wanted to come to Nuremberg. It was a very sobering experience to be standing at a place where people were whipped into such a frenzy. It was interesting to read about the development of the cult of The Fuhrer and the development of German National Socialism from a fringe group to the legal government of the country to a totalitarian regime that committed the most unthinkable atrocities.

Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,A thought provoking final exhibit. . . .,"Visited here and spent several hours working my way through the exhibits. Much of this I have studied at some length, but there's always something that is new.

The final exhibit was, for me, the most thought provoking..... it's something that was established with the support of DeutscheBahn, the German railway network, and shows sixty thousand cards covering a forty meter stretch of railway track behind a glass window. Each card carries the name, or details, or an acknowledgement of someone who was a victim of the Nazis and their being in power between 1933 and 1945. The legend explains that each card represents the murder or death by neglect of over a hundred people, and if there was a card for each victim the railway line would need to stretch over 4KM - right back to the old castle in the north of the Altstadt. Profound stuff, and an excellent way of quantifying the volume of the atrocities that took place, in a way that statistics in a book will always struggle to bring out","Written December 1, 2018"

Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,Very interesting story,"I slightly overdosed on Dokumentationszentrums while I was in Germany, so by the time I got to this one, the story was already well told elsewhere. However, at a certain point the story diverged and started taking about the Nuremberg rallies instead. Those infamous pictures and videos were held at the nearby Luitpoldan grounds. There was one wall dealing with the atrocities meted out to the Jews and other ‚Äúunclean‚Äù races but to be fair that was not its focus.

It‚Äôs still pretty horrifying especially the silent movie in the middle showing the young and old assemblage at the Luitpoldan grounds not far from where you were standing and only a generation ago. Because I‚Äôd arrived at opening time and so was in that first group of 30 eager historians I may have rushed through a few rooms to stay ahead of the crowd but it still felt like hours before I emerged blinking into the sunshine.

I followed it with a lovely riverside walk around the area (following the placards or not as the case may be), which relieved the mood somewhat.

Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,Really worthwhile visit,"I would say by far the most interesting places to the visit in Nuremberg are the old Nazi rally grounds (Zeppelinfeld) and the Documentation Centre. We were staying at the Hilton Nuremberg, which is walking distance to both ‚Äì we visited the rally grounds first. If you are travelling from the centre, there is a tram that stops just outside the Documentation Centre ‚Äì you then need to walk around the lake to the rally grounds.

The Documentation Centre has a modern entrance. Admission is 6.00 ‚Ç¨ and that includes an audio guide ‚Äì you enter the number shown on the area you are viewing for audio description in multiple languages.

The centre contains some harrowing historical scenes, some posters and memorabilia and a record of war crimes.

There is a dramtic art installation that shows the names (on cards) of those sent to concentration camps.

All the installations are presented really well.

There is also a terrace where you can look out to the Congress Hall.

You exit the centre via a long sloping walkway.

If you turn left at the exit, you can walk around to the Congress Hall entrance ‚Äì there isn‚Äôt any signposting and you find yourself walking along a deserted portico that leads to the entrance.

Inside the place is vast ‚Äì the plan was to add a roof, but the war was over before that happened.

We retraced our steps and returned to our hotel.

I would definitely recommend a visit but make sure you visit the parts that are un-packaged; Congress Hall and Rally Grounds.","Written October 30, 2018"

Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,Nazi History incredibly presented,"This place is incredible. Firstly, I want to reiterate that it is NOT a museum, it's been called a Documentation Centre because that's precisely what it is. Documents accumulated over long periods of time, giving evidence of what occurred during this time in history. Stuff that you'll have to sit and actually read (or listen with the audioguide). Entry is very reasonable at just 6 euros.

It highlights and gives incredulous amounts of information (you get an audioguide in your language - not sure how many languages they have), so many accounts of people's lives not only in the camps that we know and have heard about in history at school and so on. It also shows the extent to which Hitler would go to create an empire for himself, architectures fit for a God (he was rumoured to be the epitome of narcissism) - which I think was mentioned somewhere along the way.

A little warning, it does take a while to get through, I needed the toilet halfway through and since we were closer to the exit, we quickly went out and then back in the same way. That was the only inconvenience so make sure you have a toilet break beforehand! It took us about 2 - 3 hours and there aren't many places to sit, maybe 1 or 2 chairs in each area or so unless it has the screens with videos.

I don't think they allow flash photography but I took enough photos of things that particularly peaked my interest.

Overall, my mum and I found it incredible, the building has been a well-kept part of history and it was eyeopening to see what could have happened but fortunately didn't. You only know a small scale of it from grandparents or great-grandparents or from history, but to see documents of dates, projects, money, personal interviews, the list could go on.

The rise of the Nazi Party and it's fascination with rituals as their visible expression of their power are clearly laid out.

It has interviews with some of the slave labourers who were cutting the blocks of stone for the centre and for the rallying ground who were being beaten and starved to death right up to the end of the war including the Natzwieller Concentration Camp in France, while construction work had long ceased.
On leaving the centre you can walk to the Zepplin field and rallying ground and stand on what's left of the structure that the Nazi leaders would address the adoring crowds.

It was 6‚Ç¨ entry including an audio guide (this is teamed with some of the other museums in the city so if you go on the same day you get half price entry to another one with your ticket), but you should save at least about 3hours for this one...we spent 5hours there, with the Dok-zentrum, and the walk around the lake to see the outside of the ‚Äòcolosseum‚Äô, the marching strip, and the Zeppelin field.
The museum was very informative, but spread out well so it was easy to pick up and not feel bombarded by all the information.
A fascinating piece of history, finishing with the trials. It‚Äôs great that they‚Äôve put the building to some use, the vastness of the area is mind-blowing.","Written September 5, 2018"
Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,An historical experience well worth a visit,"The Dokumentationzentrum is located in the place most of the Nazi rallies took place. The remains of the old structure can be seen.

A new modern structure over arches the old building which contains the history of the Nazi party from the circumstances of its formation to its eventual collapse amid the ruin of Germany it caused. Most of the exhibits are in Germany but an audioguide is included in admission. I cannot comment on the English audioguide as I had a German one, which was excellent. Depending on the time you have the guide has supplemental material which you can listen to for more depth.

A visit here should be followed by a visit to the ""Memorium"", which is where the N√ºrnberg trials took place and documents the process. A combi-ticket is possible.

A tram 8 from the Hauptbahnhof (main railway station) goes to the Doku-zentrum. From Pl√§rrer a tram 6 also goes there.",
Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,"One of the most detailed accounts of a past that still hurts many in germany.

However, very few have detailed documentation and share / show all of it, without prejudice.. This isn't the winners or losers version but a fact and timeline based multi sensory documentation of the rise, reign and fall of the National Socialistic movement in Germany.
They dont hide anything, no matter how much it hurts their image and this is what I really respect.
It is this very fact that makes walking through the different halls / looking at images / videos really difficult as it is moving.
You should ideally come early as it can sometimes get crowded, get the audio guide as it has a lot more information on it. If possible dont bring bags etc.,. as they will make you lock them up. The small shop also has books and literature on a lot of what you see.

Germany,Documentation Center Nazi Party Rally Grounds,The complete history of the Nazi Party is here,"What a comprehensive exhibit!

An audio guide is essential if you do not want to miss any of the information available here. The exhibition is large, and we were here for about three hours and definitely did not see or hear everything on offer.

The exhibition is divided into sections. Each section has a number for the audio guide, starting in the hundreds, so 100, 200 and so on. Entering this number into the device plays a recording giving an overview of, and introduction to each section. Each individual display panel has its own audio description, so 101, 102 etc.

In addition to the numbered recordings, many of the sections also contain video displays. When in the vicinity of the video, the audio guide will play the sound of the video, without the user having to press any buttons on the device. This additional feature was not explained at the reception desk and I had to find out about it as I went along - consequently I missed out on some of the earlier displays until I figured out what was happening.

This is only a minor cavil at what is a very well thought out exhibition.

Pictures and audio guide take you through the rise of the Nazi party and their followers. The biggest excuse from the documentary on show tells how people in authority denied any knowledge of what was happening. This is a history lesson that must not be forgotten or repeated.

Germany,Europa-Park,First visit,"Europa Park is Europe's biggest themepark.
Based on different countries in Europe each country is represented by various rides, shows, restaurants and giftshops.
After a ferry ride , a LONG drive and lots of Covid related paperwork I can say that getting to this themepark was well worth the effort.
Every area of the park is beautifully themed, very scenic and very clean.
We came mid week in October and the park was still quite busy although as the park is so big it is able to swallow up the worst of the crowds.
We queued on average about 30 minutes for most of the major rides. The minor rides were all walk on.
Be warned this is a HUGE park and you won't do it all in one day.
We had 2 days and just about managed to do everything we wanted to.
There is something for everyone here from coasters, water and dark rides to pretty parks and stunning scenery.
We came just before Halloween and the park was superbly decorated with displays, costumed performers and thousands of pumpkins.
One of our favourite moments was taking an hour out to just take a walk and enjoy the pumpkin park.
Food is tasty and moderately priced for a themepark.
We mostly ate on the go food here such as hotdogs, pretzels and cakes. I recommend the pumpkin soup which was delicious.
I have been to some of the World's best themeparks including Orlandos finest and I can honestly say Europa Park is equally as good as them.
( Orlando just takes the lead because of the good weather )
This was our first visit here and won't be the last.

Germany,Europa-Park,The attractions ride with empty seats while people are waiting for hours in queues.,"We spent most of the day waiting in queues while at the same time the rides were departing with empty seats!!!
I am not talking about single empty seats. It was frequent to see 2 or more empty seats next to each other because the staff of the park did not care at all to organise people to come forwards and occupy the seats that larger groups did not wanted to take.
There were also often people smoking in the queues, but of course there was nobody to take care of it, because there is not enough staff to observe such things.","Written October 12, 2021"
Germany,Europa-Park,Too Much Cigarette Smoke!,"I love this park, but you leave here feeling like you smoked a pack of cigarettes! Smoking is allowed everywhere outdoors.

It said big thighs wouldnt fit in the seats but im a size 18 and was a good fit. I reckon if you fit in Uk ones ok then you will be fine. Traffic control was brill, in and out in no time at all. Surprise ride was 'Arthur' it was a magical but also an awesome ride. The water rides were hilarious. The food cost about ‚Ç¨60 for four adults to eat. But it was really good food. Would def go back here :)",
Germany,Europa-Park,Highly Recommended,"It was a very pleasant place to be at. At the beginning when the park literally just opened, queues were short but as the day progressed especially into the afternoon the crowd began to flood in (even whilst covid) and waiting time for rides increased. Although we were pretty sure it would have been much worse without covid.

However, the experience was amazing, definitely worth the entrance fees. The shows were great, rides; both thrilling and chill were enjoyable. Food there was pricey, but which theme park doesn't charge premium prices for food?

Definitely recommended and a place to visit when you're in the area, or make a trip there just for it.",

Corona still being very present in Germany but in the Europapark? Well leave all your social obstacles at the entrace gate and don‚Äòt worry they barely have enough staff to clean the toilet!

- smoke Weed everywhere: no problem
- drink as much as you can, scream shoot : don‚Äôt worry they don‚Äôt care
- wear no masks, keep no distance and let us just all pretend there is no Corona? That‚Äôs great come in!

While the rest of the staff is doing a poor and ignorant job, the PR department is the true star of the park: in every newspaper you can read EP has a great concept!

Ridiculous they should lock this place down!!

Everything is outdated the queues are ridiculous, the food is cheap fried stuff (quality level of a bad gas station) and the prices are well above the quality they offer.

They do have a few good rides but this park lives in the past. The new pirate attraction is in every aspect centuries behind what Disney is doing while they brazenly copy the true Pirates ride.

The people in the park all seem to have adapted on this new management focus because money and profit is the only motivation. Very sad, the health and well being of people should be a major concern as well.

The only phone menu in a language besides GermanÔøº (English and French are offeredÔøº) merely tells you that you can find more information on their website and then hangs up on you. Furthermore, the online ticket ordering system is a clunky two-step process. First, you buy a ticket voucher. Then,Ôøº you use the voucher to book tickets for the day you actually want to go to the park. Why don‚Äôt they just have a one step process through which you buy a ticket for the day that you want to go to the park?

Germany,Europa-Park,One of the best amusement parks,"Came here in July, it was 37 degrees but luckily there are a lot of water attractions and coasters.
Parking was not to expensive but spots are quite small. From the parking it was not far to the entrance. The parks looks amazing and most EU countries have their own region with attractions, coasters and food joints. The decoration of the regions and attractions are phenomenal!
Due to COVID only maximum amount of people were allowed in the park. Still enough people but manageable. A lot of employees check if measures are followed up especially in waiting lines where, also outside, mouth mask, were obligated. Even in the attractions self, no problem at all!

We had a perfect day, even better than expected!","Written September 3, 2020"
Germany,Europa-Park,"Great park, but needs to do better with covid regulations","We really looked forward to our visit to europapark and bought the tickets online in advance. Seeing as ordering online was mandatory, we expected that they cut down visitors numbers so that it wouldn't be to crowded. This didn't appear to be the case. Keeping 1,5 meters distance was therefore nearly impossible, especially while walking around. In line, many people really tried to adhere to this rule, but some others seemed oblivious. Personally I thought there should be more surveillance and staff should act more on this. At the parts where the queue is zigzagging close together, there were screens and other protective surfaces, which was good. However, when you enter the platform to get on the rollercoaster train, you're still side to side with others, without screens in between. The same goes for rollercoasters which seat 4 people next to each other. Also, because of the mandatory distance, lines were very long. Sometimes even crossing squares etc, making it hard to navigate and keep distance while walking from attraction to attraction.

The park itself really impressed me. There were so many attractions, for every age group. Around 7 thrilling rollercoasters, some great dark rides for the family, a ton of water rides and much more. We walked around all day and still haven't done everything. We will definitely go back in the future to do the other rides! What I like is that all of the attractions were quite original. For example; Cassandra's curse is a ride that I've seen variations on at multiple different parks. This one however had some extra original touches, aside from the decor which obviously differs per park. This surprised me! In addition all of the rides are well maintained and beautifully decorated. Waiting in line definitely was made more fun with all the added statues, use of short film screenings, quizzes and other interactive elements etc. The whole park gave the impression that landscaping but also upkeep of buildings is a high priority. It looked amazing. The different areas definitely feel like the countries they are representing. The atmosphere was pleasant.

Waiting times varied from 30 minutes to around 60. Some smaller, less visible dark rides didn't have a line at all. There is a also virtual line system, that reduces waiting times for an extra fee. The VR coasters charge an extra fee, differing from 2 to 6 euros. Personally I though this was a bit ridiculous, considering that the park fee isn't necessarily inexpensive.

Tickets cost 55 euros and parking is 7. This is quite a sum of money, and definitely more expensive than Dutch theme parks. In comparison to other German theme parks, this is fairly standard though. I did like this park way better than the other German theme parks I've visited. You'll get a lot of value for your money. Would love to go back one day, but after covid.","Written August 18, 2020"
Germany,Europa-Park,"COVID 19 and Europa Park, Should you go?","After a recent visit to Europa-Park during the COVID-19 pandemic, I hope the stories I have here below to share will help you to decide to visit the park or not.
The rule is to always wear a mask over your nose and mouth as well as line up with a 1.5-meter gap between people in queues. There is announcements and written information about this all over the park. Most of the staff remind you if the mask slips down or you have lowered it trying to breath in the 35-degree weather, but the outsourced security company is another problem.

Several times while in the park for two days, we had problems with them, and we also witnessed others being bullied and harassed by them as well. These people are trained in crowd control and not in family fun park customer service. It is also like they have their own rules that differ from what the park tells you.

I was waiting in line for the Silver Star ride and I just happened to be filming the ride when three security guards approached me and told me I had to leave the ride because my mask had been down and I was seen be them on security camera. When they approached me, my mask was up, but I was told I was seen on the camera. Nowhere is it pointed out that you will be kicked out if your mask is down. The way I was escorted out of the ride was very rude, embarrassing and intimidating. I did say sorry, but the guy was not having it. This you would never get in Disneyland. Remember you are in these lines for 30 to 45 min, it is boiling hot, you are sweating, and you do move your mask to breath occasionally and whip the sweat. So, to be kicked off the ride for just doing that without any warning is not fair and these rules were not communicated by Europa-Park management.

Second is the rule of eating and drinking in the ride queues. According to this security company, you are not allowed to eat and drink in the queue, but what we were eating and drinking, we bought from the kiosk in the ride queue. Plus, three children in 35-degree heat need to drink, but not according to the security guards. While waiting in a 45 min queue in 35-degree temperatures, we bought drinks and popcorn from the kiosk in the middle of the queue for the ride Woden. Soon after, three security guards walked through the queue and told my three children off quite rudely that they are not to eat and drink in the queue, though there is a kiosk and several rubbish bins in the queue. People that were standing in front of us also said something about this, shocked and stunned at the way the security spoke to the children about the food and drink we bought in the queue. Tried to explain to them we bought it in the queue, and it is hot, but they would only speak in German, raising their voices until we put the food and drinks away. Why sell you food then send an external security company after you to bully you?

As I said above, several times we saw these security guards in the park and every time, threatening about the use of the masks, so it was not just myself, but others were experiencing the same as well. I would not say everyone is affected by this, they seem to be singling out people as I saw many people walking around with their masks off or pulled down. Either they leave you alone, or single you out, we were singled out.

You know Walt Disney said to his staff that worked in Disneyland that they‚Äôre on stage when working in the park and they are required to put on a show for the park visitors. But at Europa Park, the staff are mostly grumpy. Most staff on the rides were grumpy. My children happen to speak German and confirmed this several times saying that they were spoken to badly in German. Yet I do not speak much German and could still tell just how grumpy they are. The park is stunning, and the rides are great, but it is a massive let down by the staff and security.

And just one other thing that might matter to some people, while we were waiting for the log ride, a big snake slithered out through the queue of people. We moved away quickly to get out of its way as it moved towards the water. That said, there are snakes in this park, and you can get close to them so please keep that in mind if you don't like snakes.

My advice, if you like the taste of your own sweat, enjoy wearing face mask for from 9am to 6pm in 35 degree heat, you‚Äôre ok with rude people and being bullied by security staff, then Europa Park is for you. If you want to be with friendly people, not have to wear a face mask nonstop, do not want to taste yourself all day, then do something else. It‚Äôs totally understandable why these measures are in place but the way they are enforced at Europa Park after you probably spend 800‚Ç¨ plus just being there for a couple of days, I know our next family holiday will be somewhere relaxing and quite, away in a place where we don‚Äôt have to wear masks all the time and people are nice.

The children at the end of the day enjoyed it but as for me, it is not my definition of a holiday or fun. The park itself is fun but it is amazing how the attitudes of staff can transform the experience that Europa Park could offer. The rides are great, the park is so well kept and the attention to detail is amazing. But the staff and their attitudes transform all of that to an unpleasant experience and spoil what could potentially be a great family time. Walt Disney knew this as well.","Written August 13, 2020"

There really is something to do for everyone of every age and its impossible to get bored. Europapark has so many brilliant and unique rides. Sadly we had no time to see any shows but I am sure that they were brilliant too going off how everything else in the park was.

Germany,Europa-Park,A theme park for the whole family,"We finally got to go! It has a lot of rides for young and older people. The park is so nice and big, we went for 2 days and I highly recommend to do the same to get the full experience. Sadly we didn't get the chance to go to the shows because we wanted to go to all the rides but they seemed pretty awesome.",
Germany,Europa-Park,"Good, but...","Second visit to Europa-Park for our family of five.
Again we have chosen to go during the week to avoid too much people. Again too much people to really enjoy some animations, even if we arrived very early.
Perhaps I have all wrong the concept of these parks... but when we start to have more than one hour waiting per animation, does it make sense?
We had the chance to have one tour of the Scandinavian rafting, but then it was impossible to do it again, unless waiting more than one hour. As we are in the Covid period, and not a lot of people have understood the concept of social distancing, even with the marks on the ground, we did not feel secure. And went to other attractions. There were not so many available. Therefore, I am not sure this sort of park are a good choice for the clients. All in all, we can‚Äôt enjoy the attractions as too many people are allowed to enter. It is too much expensive for the real service obtained.
Cherry on top of the cake: we were into the Lindt boutique, enjoying a fresh glass of chocolate just bought. The day was really warm and the air-conditioning created the perfect conditions for a relaxing moment.
We were, unfriendly, requested to go outside and leave the place to other customers.
I understand the Covid situation. At the same time, we have all to learn to wait. And leave an agreable moment to the customers, instead of chasing them. I would like to to underline that the five of us were enjoying Lindt products, just purchased into the boutique.
The brands should pay attention to train their teams.","Written August 10, 2020"

Germany,Europa-Park,Second visit,Another great visit to Europa Park. The COVID restrictions didn‚Äôt take away from the day. The only issue we had was where the virtual queues were as they weren‚Äôt well sign posted and the virtual places went quickly. Other than that a fab place to go with any age child and it only rained at the end of the day!,
Germany,Europa-Park,Great family day of adventure.. highly recommended,"Great amusement park with more than enough rollercoasters, water rides and other smaller rides for the whole family. We have two girls 11 and 8 and started at 9.00 when the entrance opened until 18.00... and they could have stayed even longer. We were lucky with hot sunny weather so the cooling off on the water rides was needed. A few tips:
* Plan the night before. As other posts recommended, we looked at the rides we thought we wanted to ride and noted which country they were located in. This made it easier to figure of where you wanted to go. Either print out a map or pick one up at the entrance. We found the map download hard to use on the phones.
* Go early. Be there before 9.00 and go straight to the middle of the park. Hotels are on opposite side of the entrance so middle seems the least busy. I would also go to one of the rollercoaster as the lines may be shorter. We started in Greece with Pegasus (great starter roller coaster) and we could ride a few times with only a few minutes wait. During the day, most lines were 0- 30 minutes except for Woudan wooden coaster (never saw the wait drop to less than 50min wait the entire day) or Fjord water ride (50+ minute line).
* Download the app the night before. Scan in your tickets in the Virtual Line part of the app. Start checking the Virtual Line app from 9.00 and see if you can schedule a skip the line ticket. We tried when a few time slots opened but every time we selected them it never worked. There are only a handful of rides available so know where they are located and if you want to ride them. Other things on the app--the waiting lines part is great and seemed to be pretty accurate. We found the map and directions useless.
* Think about what you want to eat and drink - You can bring in backpacks so we brought plenty of waters and a few snacks--highly recommended. As not all kiosks and restaurants are open, the lines are long for everything from ice cream to lunch and you don't want to waste time waiting 20 minutes to get a bottle of water. As for lunch, consider packing one. There are a few spots where you can sit and have a picnic. We grabbed sandwiches/soup in the sandwich bar near Arthur rollercoaster which we found decent and not over priced, and only had to wait 10 minutes (it is a bit hidden inside, as compared to other kiosks).
* Best rides - of course this depends on each family, but the best rides we found: Greece (Poseidon water ride, Pegasus); Iceland (Wodan, BlueFire); Switzerland (Swiss BobRun, Matterhorn express); Austria (AlpenExpress, swings); Portugal (Atlantic SuperSplash); Minimoys (Arthur); Scandinavia (Viking ship). Things we didn't get to: France (Eurosat cancan, Silverstar--kids weren't ready for it (11+) but looks great;); Scandinavia (Fjord Rafting - wait was always about 1 hr but looked fun); Russia (Euro-Mir). We completely skipped England, Holland, Russia, Ireland, Germany.
* We started with Switzerland and Greece, hardly any lines in either at 9.00.
* Water rides - On the Posiedon and Atlantica SuperSplash we definitely got wet (some more than others--front and those sitting on the outsides were more wet) but not to the point where we needed towels or a change of clothes. But saying that, we had 28 degree weather so we wanted to cool off a bit. The waterparks were definitely only for small kids.
* Parking/tickets - You must buy a ticket online and book a day. Scan your phone on the way in. Also it is easier to buy your parking ticket online so you scan your phone on the way out of the park. Or another tip--pay for your parking ticket before you enter the park. The lines were long at 18.00.
* French bakery- for those in need a good French baguette for the next morning, stop at the bakery in France. Eliminated a stop on the way back to our AirBnB
* Waiting in line - compared to other amusement parks, we found the way they set up the lines very well done. You meander through different types of lines (not just up one line back the other direction) so for some reason makes the wait a bit more manageable. We even anticipated our kids wanting to play on a phone during the longer waits and they didn't even ask.
* Corona measures - Everyone needs a mask when waiting in line (especially inside) and on the ride. When walking around outside the rides no one had them on. We found most everyone respectful of this requirement and it just worked. If someone forgot a mask, a worker would just quietly say mask or point to their face--not policing but reminding in a nice way--well done. We also found that most people respected some distancing in line and they had set up many lines with barriers in between tight spaces. And rides were also cleaned quite frequently--and really cleaned--you would see empty rollercoasters going after they cleaned so the ride timing wasn't lost. We all felt really good about how it all worked. We brought out own antibacterial and used it a lot but there was antibacterial in many places in the park.
* Overall--a great park. We didn't visit the swimming part but maybe another time. Highly recommended!!","Written August 1, 2020"
Germany,Europa-Park,Great fun,"We love our visit to Europa park! It has everything for everyone! I visited it in July with 2 little children (3 and 6 years old).

Th er revere huge cues everywhere, not friendly staff and we couldn‚Äôt find any children friendly places to eat. It was either restaurant or pub. It‚Äôs also a big problem to buy water. You have to stay long time in cues. Bring lots with you. I regretted, that I didn‚Äôt take a pram with me. My little ones were exhausted. I saw other parents with cute trolleys for 2-3 kids. I also had some problem with parking first day. It‚Äôs either better to leave the park earlier, before big cues and buy parking ticket from the Automat, or spend lots of time trying to buy it online.

Again we have chosen to go during the week to avoid too much people. Again too much people to really enjoy some animations, even if we arrived very early.
Perhaps I have all wrong the concept of these parks... but when we start to have more than one hour waiting per animation, does it make sense?
We had the chance to have one tour of the Scandinavian rafting, but then it was impossible to do it again, unless waiting more than one hour. As we are in the Covid period, and not a lot of people have understood the concept of social distancing, even with the marks on the ground, we did not feel secure. And went to other attractions. There were not so many available. Therefore, I am not sure this sort of park are a good choice for the clients. All in all, we can‚Äôt enjoy the attractions as too many people are allowed to enter. It is too much expensive for the real service obtained.
Cherry on top of the cake: we were into the Lindt boutique, enjoying a fresh glass of chocolate just bought. The day was really warm and the air-conditioning created the perfect conditions for a relaxing moment.
We were, unfriendly, requested to go outside and leave the place to other customers.
I understand the Covid situation. At the same time, we have all to learn to wait. And leave an agreable moment to the customers, instead of chasing them. I would like to to underline that the five of us were enjoying Lindt products, just purchased into the boutique.
The brands should pay attention to train their teams.","Written August 10, 2020"
Germany,Europa-Park,No cancellation due to Covid19 - terrible attitude!!,"Our Family with young kids changes international travel plans due to Covid Travel restrictionis and Europa Park refuses to refund our tickets bought online (with advanced notice). I think this is beyond not acceptable customer care and should be reconsidered! Management, are you serious???","Written August 7, 2020"
Germany,Europa-Park,Second visit,Another great visit to Europa Park. The COVID restrictions didn‚Äôt take away from the day. The only issue we had was where the virtual queues were as they weren‚Äôt well sign posted and the virtual places went quickly. Other than that a fab place to go with any age child and it only rained at the end of the day!,
Germany,Europa-Park,Great family day of adventure.. highly recommended,"Great amusement park with more than enough rollercoasters, water rides and other smaller rides for the whole family. We have two girls 11 and 8 and started at 9.00 when the entrance opened until 18.00... and they could have stayed even longer. We were lucky with hot sunny weather so the cooling off on the water rides was needed. A few tips:
* Plan the night before. As other posts recommended, we looked at the rides we thought we wanted to ride and noted which country they were located in. This made it easier to figure of where you wanted to go. Either print out a map or pick one up at the entrance. We found the map download hard to use on the phones.
* Go early. Be there before 9.00 and go straight to the middle of the park. Hotels are on opposite side of the entrance so middle seems the least busy. I would also go to one of the rollercoaster as the lines may be shorter. We started in Greece with Pegasus (great starter roller coaster) and we could ride a few times with only a few minutes wait. During the day, most lines were 0- 30 minutes except for Woudan wooden coaster (never saw the wait drop to less than 50min wait the entire day) or Fjord water ride (50+ minute line).
* Download the app the night before. Scan in your tickets in the Virtual Line part of the app. Start checking the Virtual Line app from 9.00 and see if you can schedule a skip the line ticket. We tried when a few time slots opened but every time we selected them it never worked. There are only a handful of rides available so know where they are located and if you want to ride them. Other things on the app--the waiting lines part is great and seemed to be pretty accurate. We found the map and directions useless.
* Think about what you want to eat and drink - You can bring in backpacks so we brought plenty of waters and a few snacks--highly recommended. As not all kiosks and restaurants are open, the lines are long for everything from ice cream to lunch and you don't want to waste time waiting 20 minutes to get a bottle of water. As for lunch, consider packing one. There are a few spots where you can sit and have a picnic. We grabbed sandwiches/soup in the sandwich bar near Arthur rollercoaster which we found decent and not over priced, and only had to wait 10 minutes (it is a bit hidden inside, as compared to other kiosks).
* Best rides - of course this depends on each family, but the best rides we found: Greece (Poseidon water ride, Pegasus); Iceland (Wodan, BlueFire); Switzerland (Swiss BobRun, Matterhorn express); Austria (AlpenExpress, swings); Portugal (Atlantic SuperSplash); Minimoys (Arthur); Scandinavia (Viking ship). Things we didn't get to: France (Eurosat cancan, Silverstar--kids weren't ready for it (11+) but looks great;); Scandinavia (Fjord Rafting - wait was always about 1 hr but looked fun); Russia (Euro-Mir). We completely skipped England, Holland, Russia, Ireland, Germany.
* We started with Switzerland and Greece, hardly any lines in either at 9.00.
* Water rides - On the Posiedon and Atlantica SuperSplash we definitely got wet (some more than others--front and those sitting on the outsides were more wet) but not to the point where we needed towels or a change of clothes. But saying that, we had 28 degree weather so we wanted to cool off a bit. The waterparks were definitely only for small kids.
* Parking/tickets - You must buy a ticket online and book a day. Scan your phone on the way in. Also it is easier to buy your parking ticket online so you scan your phone on the way out of the park. Or another tip--pay for your parking ticket before you enter the park. The lines were long at 18.00.
* French bakery- for those in need a good French baguette for the next morning, stop at the bakery in France. Eliminated a stop on the way back to our AirBnB
* Waiting in line - compared to other amusement parks, we found the way they set up the lines very well done. You meander through different types of lines (not just up one line back the other direction) so for some reason makes the wait a bit more manageable. We even anticipated our kids wanting to play on a phone during the longer waits and they didn't even ask.
* Corona measures - Everyone needs a mask when waiting in line (especially inside) and on the ride. When walking around outside the rides no one had them on. We found most everyone respectful of this requirement and it just worked. If someone forgot a mask, a worker would just quietly say mask or point to their face--not policing but reminding in a nice way--well done. We also found that most people respected some distancing in line and they had set up many lines with barriers in between tight spaces. And rides were also cleaned quite frequently--and really cleaned--you would see empty rollercoasters going after they cleaned so the ride timing wasn't lost. We all felt really good about how it all worked. We brought out own antibacterial and used it a lot but there was antibacterial in many places in the park.
* Overall--a great park. We didn't visit the swimming part but maybe another time. Highly recommended!!","Written August 1, 2020"
Germany,Europa-Park,Great fun,"We love our visit to Europa park! It has everything for everyone! I visited it in July with 2 little children (3 and 6 years old). We mainly went to the attractions for small children in the beginning of the park. The only problem was with food. Th er revere huge cues everywhere, not friendly staff and we couldn‚Äôt find any children friendly places to eat. It was either restaurant or pub. It‚Äôs also a big problem to buy water. You have to stay long time in cues. Bring lots with you. I regretted, that I didn‚Äôt take a pram with me. My little ones were exhausted. I saw other parents with cute trolleys for 2-3 kids. I also had some problem with parking first day. It‚Äôs either better to leave the park earlier, before big cues and buy parking ticket from the Automat, or spend lots of time trying to buy it online. You have to download app, then register several times, etc. a bit of stress with 2 tired kids. Otherwise it‚Äôs a great experience!","Written July 29, 2020"
Germany,Europa-Park,Amazing theme park,"I‚Äôve been to a lot of theme parks and I think this was my favourite, even better than those in Orlando. It is massive and has a lot of rides suitable for all ages. It was quite crowded despite the restricted numbers even on a Monday. There is a varied selection of food - we enjoyed Greek kebabs. Each ‚Äúcountry‚Äù is authentic with attention to detail. The longest queue we had was for the Can Can coaster (50 min) but the rest were shorter. Our favourite rides were Poseidon, Blue Fire and Silver Star. The Euro-Mir ride was very different but good! You would need at least 2 days here to experience everything.",

Germany,Europa-Park,Great experience,"I know Europa Park from when I was a kid and now came back the first time as a parent with a 6 year old. I found that compared to other parks Europa Park has a wide spectrum from scary rides all the way to relaxing boat rides and kids friendly rides and activities.
We were also very lucky as due to the current restrictions they only let very few visitors in and we didn‚Äôt have to wait more that 10-15 min at any of the rides.","Written July 6, 2020"
Germany,Europa-Park,Still awesome after 7 previous visits,"Ah, Europa-Park, our dear friend :) We have been to Europa-Park at least 7 times before now and boy, it still delivers :) It was fascinating to recognize that we have been there from early opening (~8:50) to closing (~18:20) non-stop going on rides and doing fun things, while only stopping for lunch once and then for a short ~10 minute break a little bit after. And that's it. Otherwise we were rushing from queue to queue and enjoying the rides, even for the 8th time in our lives.

What made this visit extra special though is the significantly shorter queue times due to 1) the coronavirus 2) it being a Friday. Getting on Silver Star after 15 minutes? Are you kidding? Getting on Blue Fire after 20 minutes? Haha! For those who were there before on a weekend can attest to how short those times are.

But you know, Europa-Park is not just about the rides, it is about the ambiance, the setting, the magic, the fun, occasionally rather good food and just spending time in good company.

And as long as you can find and bring good company, you will have a fantastic time!
Worth it, 5/5 each time we were there!
Pro tip: if possible, go on a weekday (and ideally Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday) and enjoy super short queue times.","Written July 5, 2020"
Germany,Europa-Park,Great time!,"This theme park is for everybody! It is especially great for families with kids of all ages and for group of friends. I have been here twice and a couple of times in the bars and restaurants in the park.

I am not a thrill seeker and do not ride much of the rides but I still enjoyed my visits there. I tried two roller coasters (Blue Fire and Timburcoaster), one on each visit. Scarily screamed my lungs off but YOLO. I am afraid of heights and speed but I still tried some of the rides.

If you are not into it, there are other rides you can try. They also got other attractions, such as shows which are also entertaining.

If you got kids, they offer options, where one of the adults can take the ride while the other wait with the kids. After the ride, the other one can take the turn without lining up again. And speaking of lining up, there is a free App where you can check how long it takes to take a ride.

The park got gardens as well if you want to rest or have a picnic. You can also bring some food with you.

It is advisable to bring extra clothes with you as I got wet in the Fjord Rafting. It was fund though.

There are a lot of things to do here and you will have a great time so be there early and try to maximize your time. If you can buy tickets in advance, the better!","Written June 26, 2020"
Germany,Europa-Park,"Excellent for kids, sleeping in one of the hotels can be a real advantage for priviledged access","My 7-year-old son and I really enjoyed this theme-park. Good range of activities, thrilling ones, more relaxed ones, great mix!
The park would benefit from a clearer transit/transportation scheme, as you can lose some time finding the way to reach the activities on your wish-list. A few lame stuff (jungle cruise ride, reminded me of Weird Al Jankovic's song!), but the great majority are great and real fun.
Sleeping in one of the park's hotels can be pricey but worth it: complimentary access to the park during the final hour on your arrival day, and early access in the morning before the regular opening time: twice the opportunity to have shorter queues at the major attractions!","Written June 8, 2020"

Very confusing to know how to get to the attractions, at one point we decided just to walk forward in hope that we found what we wanted.
Also i'm more into thrill rides than familiar ones and shows and that's not what europa park is best at. Only 1 good roller-coaster. The good thing about this park was the shows that were really nice. If you have kid, it's for you. If you're alone and want to have fun, probably not for you.","Written January 20, 2020"

Germany,Europa-Park,Simply one of the best theme parks,"When you think of massive theme park resorts, most think of Disney or Universal, but Europa Park can easily cope up with them and even beat them in some categories. And its still growing.
To my review:

I visited the park on the 1. september (monday). So I expected the park to be not too crowded. I arrived via bus from Luxemburg shortly before the park opened. The entry price is under 50‚Ç¨ , compared to Disney Worlds Hollywood Studios which costs over 100$ for entry, its pretty great.
As the parked opened I quickly rushed to Silverstar (a 70m tall B&M hyper coaster which you already see from the parking lot). I managed to do 4 rides in a row without waiting. Amazing ride! After that I went to Can can coaster, the queue line is amazingly themed with much details. If you watch closely you can see some scenery object that remind of the old space theme. The ride features a rare spiral lift hill and is all indoor. (sadly didn't try the VR)
Next I went for the water coaster Poseidon which had no wait at all. Still a very cool and nice themed ride, very long too and with 2 splash downs.
I also tried Pegasus, a family coaster, was pretty ok. Its a bit hidden but also a very short ride.
Then I tried that laser shooting ride (don't remember the name) in the Greek area. Was pretty cool but seemed a bit abandoned and the queue line was partly pitch black (almost fell once).
Matterhorn blitz is a very cool coaster too, even though its a bit smaller. Its a custom layout wild mouse with a vertical lift, so pretty unique. The swiss Bobbahn on the other side has some heavy theming but I didn't really like the short layout. Also had no wait.
Good old Euromir was next. The coaster is also unique. There is just one of its kind (Spiral lift spinning coaster). The ride begins slowly and gets quicker with sharp turns at the end. It became a bit rough though.
Next was the inverted powered dark ride / coaster Arthur. This one is the only one not themed to an european country but to a movie. The ride is (now) also a one of a kind ride and is pretty well themed and very entertaining.
For a refreshment I went to Fjord Rafting, a decent rafting water ride. Was a bit too standard for me. The ride could use a drop in its course.
My next ride was Wodan, a thrilling wooden coaster with a very nice layout. The wait was 20min but I used the single ride line and didn't wait at all. (note: only Wodan and Blue Fire have single rider for now)
Blue fire is a cool launched coaster with inversions. The last roll is pretty intense.
If you are into water rides there is also a log flume in the Austrian area and another but shorter water coaster (Atlantica Supersplash) in the Portuguese area which had also no wait.
I also checked out the restautant where the food you ordered is coming to your table via a small roller coaster through the restaurant. The restaurant mostly very packed but worth checking out.

Conclusion:

The park is very beautifully themed with love to detail and quality (like you know from Germans). You always discover new areas and details when revisiting the park. Don't rush when at the park but admire its beauty. The queue lines are heavy themed so it mostly doesn't get boring.

There are areas for everyone: quieter places to walk around, large playing areas, amazing shows, roller coasters from tame to thrill etc. Everyone finds his place and the variety of rides and theming is enormous. Its in my opinion the best park for families. But its also time for the park to get a new thrill attraction.
If you look for good quality food, you don't get disappointed. As the parks different areas represent european countries, you find that countries best dishes in its areas restaurants. If you want to overnight in the resort, the hotels have top reviews, sadly I haven't overnighted there so I can't say more.
Also a very important note is that the ride dispatches are insanely fast compared to other parks. The trains are sometimes only 35s in the station before they leave. again.
Another interesting fact is that they allow gopros on roller coasters (only with a chest mount of course), you can even rent them there.
And very important is: check which countries around have holidays, and avoid weekends or bridge days. On packed days the lines can get up to 90min for the main rides. On quieter days you can almost enter each attraction with 0-15min wait.

If you need longer than 3h to get to the park, overnight there. There is so much to see and to too, and you don't need stress. The hotels are great and since the park is growing and now has a water park its worth it.",

Germany,Europa-Park,Christmas Visit,"So the sat nav said 3.2 hours to get here from Geneva. Er, more like 4.5. Then we had to queue for a shuttle bus from the parking. Which dropped us at the side entrance. Now I don't mind that kind of thing - sometimes its a shortcut. But it was not in this case. 3 cash desks serving a queue north of 300, running down a narrow exterior space. They hadn't thought this through. Then we had to queue to get to food for another 30 mins. We sat down pretty exhausted ! But then the fun started - the food at the Asian restaurant was pretty darn good. We then did the main 4 rides over the space of the afternoon / evening. Wodan (wooden coaster) was whip quick and really good fun. I loved the loops and corkscrews of blue fire. Euro Mir was a bit milder, but then dangled you over the edge perilously. The most heart stopping was Silver Star. Good Merc themed exhibits around it. The top of the ride was in cloud it was so high. Straight up. Almost straight down. Wow, several heart in mouth moments on this ride. So 4 rides in 6 hours. Would I go again ? Not sure that represents good value. The rides were fun and the Xmas decs & lighting great. The queues were not. Try to find an off peak moment people. It will save hours of your life ! However, I have to say that all our teens all loved it. When can you say that with 6 of them between us ?",

Some of the attraction are closed during winter, but you will see others instead.so didn‚Äôt brother too much.

Shows are amazing, there are also plenty of rides for young kids available. Our liked the pirate swing :-)

You will get food literally at each and every corner, prices are ok and delicious (remember you are in a theme park). Better to take a bite with, if you can effort you will be well covered by the Park.

It‚Äôs easy to spent The Who,e day there, next time we will go for a 2 days trip.

All in all - great family fun time, we all love it!",
Germany,Europa-Park,Christmas Visit,"So the sat nav said 3.2 hours to get here from Geneva. Er, more like 4.5. Then we had to queue for a shuttle bus from the parking. Which dropped us at the side entrance. Now I don't mind that kind of thing - sometimes its a shortcut. But it was not in this case. 3 cash desks serving a queue north of 300, running down a narrow exterior space. They hadn't thought this through. Then we had to queue to get to food for another 30 mins. We sat down pretty exhausted ! But then the fun started - the food at the Asian restaurant was pretty darn good. We then did the main 4 rides over the space of the afternoon / evening. Wodan (wooden coaster) was whip quick and really good fun. I loved the loops and corkscrews of blue fire. Euro Mir was a bit milder, but then dangled you over the edge perilously. The most heart stopping was Silver Star. Good Merc themed exhibits around it. The top of the ride was in cloud it was so high. Straight up. Almost straight down. Wow, several heart in mouth moments on this ride. So 4 rides in 6 hours. Would I go again ? Not sure that represents good value. The rides were fun and the Xmas decs & lighting great. The queues were not. Try to find an off peak moment people. It will save hours of your life ! However, I have to say that all our teens all loved it. When can you say that with 6 of them between us ?",

You should seriously review it.","Written October 26, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Amazing Park and Amazing Customer Service,"My husband and I recently visited Europa Park. We seek out amusement parks and I can not tell you enough how awesome we thought this park was. And even more awesome was the staff! The park is laid out a lot like Disney's Epcot with different countries to go through. Each having their own personal flare of personality and adventures. The park also had a few other Disney similarities in there such as some of the rides and attractions. And how ironic is their mascot...A Mouse! But Europa Park also has it's own magic with a lot of German twists and fun. You can not come to Germany and miss out on a day or two of this park. So here are my thoughts on this review of the park...

First the park: I have one word to describe it...WOW! So many different displays, rides, attractions and restaurants. Our favorite restaurant was the Food Loop and our favorite ride (really hard to pick) Voletarium. We love to seek out amusement parks. This was so clean and well maintained. They have the lines going steadily too. I recommend going 2 days to see everything but we only had 1 day. So here are a few tips if you can only go 1 day. Download the app before hand!!! Get familiarized with the park layout and read reviews so you have an idea of what is there. Pick out the top things you want to do and map them out on the app. All the rest will be bonus things. This way you won't feel disappointed you missed out on anything. The app will also give you wait times and directions when you get there to adjust your schedule. Secondly, use the single rider lines when possible. It will save you a lot of time if you don't have a fast pass. Take time to enjoy the scenery. There is so many details!

Secondly the staff: We were left in a sticky situation without international phone service (which we had paid for) in a country we'd never been to before, trying to enjoy our stay. We missed our check in time for our next hotel by accident and had no way to contact anyone or look for another hotel. We honestly didn't know what to do! So at the mercy of their employees we told them what had happened and they stayed late to help us to find another hotel after hours so we wouldn't have to sleep in the car. I will forever be so grateful to them for this kindness!!! Also the staff throughout the park was willing to help when asked. There are members walking around just to help direct their customers and information booths set up throughout the park. They have it down!
If we ever make it back to Germany, this will again be a stop on our list of things to do. We have put this park up to the top of our favorites list and can't wait to come back and play at Europa Park!",
Germany,Europa-Park,Amazingly many types of roller coasters !!,"I come here as part of honeymoon activities with my hubby. We love it so much!! My hubby love Silver the most, second is the Alpine one. Blue fire is very fun! Can can‚Äù is a good start before enjoy other roller coasters. They provide many types of challenges. Today, we played 7 roller coasters!",
Germany,Europa-Park,Great day!!,"It was a pleasure to spent a day in Europa Park,we will repeat it soon!!Everything is so organized,the food is on every step,everybody is having fun,and the ""trains between countries""is the best!","Written October 18, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Perfect for young adventurous people: Theme Park with a lot of roller coasts and attractions,"We spend recently six days in sequence in Europa Park and the last two days became very boring. In other words, it is very good for two to three days adventure and entertainment but not longer. Compared to other two major theme parks in Europe: Euro Disneyland and Heide Park, Europa Park is only outstanding for us as its location near to Switzerland. Disneyland has much more to offer besides those roller coasts and Heide Park is much cheaper. What I personally do not like the most in the park is its smell of smoking everywhere. Too many smoking people around and there is no smoking ban in the park. It is a little bit pity. Other than that, it is a decent park.","Written October 18, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,The Best Park,"This is by far the best park in Europe. My family and I have been to parks in France, Italy and Spain. This place is amazing! Rides, food, shows are great and best of all is very affordable. One thing: You need at least two full days to experience everything this place has to offer. I‚Äôm from Florida (USA) and in a way a mix between Epcot Center and Busch Gardens. No matter what your age is, there is something here for you. ENJOY!!!!","Written October 16, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Had a Good Time,Europa park was stunning.. the park has loads of thrill rides and great ambiance. It is good for adults as well as children. the food at the park was good and tasty. We enjoyed the day. The wait times for the main rides were around half an hour. Other rides were just 5 to 10 minutes.,"Written November 5, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Amazing stay at Europapark,"We spent a night in the ‚ÄòTipidorf‚Äô and the Saturday at Europapark with a group of young teenagers.
The Tipis are surprisingly comfortable (floorheating!), the bathrooms clean and the delicious breakfast had all we wished for and more.
The sunny day in Europapark was great, everybody loved the park, the rides and the food options - we had a blast!
The high train was also a fabulous way to get around comfortably and with a view.

Two caveats though:
The queues for the rides were inacceptably long (40-50 min minimum, some were 70 or even 90 min plus...). At that rate you will make it to 5-6 rides max a day - and only if you are organized...
A limit to amount of visitors admitted per day might be worthwhile to consider.
And to me a must: the Tipidorf and the park should have a strict non-smoking policy for such a family attraction. Smoke was seeping into the tent from people smoking outside and while queuing in the park you had to cope with all these smokers around you )-:","Written November 3, 2019"

Good day out for all the family, park well runs the different areas all well presented. Prices on par with other theme parks and food places pretty average.",
Germany,Europa-Park,Worth the trip,We went here for the first time in October and were not disappointed. We have been to different amusement parks all over the world and really enjoyed our visit. Longest queue was 45 minutes but overall the waiting lanes weren¬¥t that bad. We spend the whole day from opening to the end here and barely managed the rides we had in mind Make sure you plan accordingly or even 2 days for the visit.

Germany,Europa-Park,For the whole family,"Loved the park! Went with my siblings, cousin and friend and did not have enough time to go on everything the park offers. The rollercoasters were amazing and the landscaping and decorations for October were beautiful. Was amazed at how cheap things were compared to other parks (Disney, Universal, etc). The park has things for all ages and while my parents would perhaps not go on certain things they would have enjoyed just walking around and attending some of the shows. Definitely worth a visit with children, teens, older adults, the whole family.","Written October 13, 2019"

Germany,Europa-Park,The Best Theme Park Visited to Date,"Having visited Disneyland and Legoland before a few times, we were prepared for a commercial kitsch awaiting us at Europa Park but the place was a pleasant surprise. Much better put together and built than Disneyland for sure. However as with every theme park, in order to enjoy yourself there are a few rules to follow:
1. spend time before you go planning your day - go through the map and the Lands, work out which rides you want to go on.
2. the most popular rides are the rollercoasters in France, Scandinavia, Portugal and Grreece. Also Arthur ride in MiniMoys Land gets huge queues (its worth it) so aim to do those first.
3. The best way to enjoy it is to stay overnight in their Hotel - it really completes your experience, the little kids get to meet Euromouse and the extra 30 minutes before opening time in the morning makes a HUGE difference - we went on 5 rides before hte park was even open. The ones we liked we went back to back 3 times without ququing at all....
4. If you are not a daredevil like me, I recommend Austria - there Alpine Log Hume and Alpine Express is a crowd pleaser for thew whole family including adults and kids from age 6. Another good ride which you wont need to queque for is next door to Can Can Rollercoaster (huge waiting time) - its called Madame .... Curiosities and its just wacky and cute and a nice break
5. Lunch in Germany in the original Schloss which is authentic","Written October 12, 2019"

Germany,Europa-Park,Always worth visiting,"I have been many many times to this park and I really love it. Everything is beautifully made and you can see a clear development in regards to theming and attractions from year to year. Although I think many things resemble in a very strong way Disney and those theme parks but I really don‚Äôt bother. Great park and I am very happy to have it within my area. I love the thrill rides, the constant updates and overall the set up of the park.
The prices are pretty constantly on the move upwards which is kind of a pity but it is still worth it in my opinion. The wait times are pretty much what you would except but in my opinion still good.

I will come back again!",
Germany,Europa-Park,An unforgettable day,Visiting Europa Park again after 24 years. As a teenager in the past and with my wife and 2 kids now. Really amazing experience for all of us. I will surely come back and stay in a Europa Park hotel for 2 - 3 days to enjoy all the games and shows and also the wonderful environment. Hope to see you soon.,
Germany,Europa-Park,Outstanding,"This park is just amazing. It never fails to impress every time. Huge variety of rides, awesome theming and amazing operations. Where else will you find coaster trains unloading and loading in less than 30 seconds. I also like that there is no fastrack system as this makes it completely fair and the queue constantly moves as a result. On some of the larger attractions you can utilise a single rider queue which reduces queue times on busy days if you're willing to split from your group. My only minor moan is that park audio was very quiet or not switched on in many of the areas.","Written September 14, 2019"

Germany,Europa-Park,It's another Five Stars!!!!,"Well, after returning from another trip at Europa Park, my thought remains that it is the best theme park in the world. If anyone finds better, please message me and let me know.

The first thing that stands out in the intricate theming in every area. The amount of thought that has gone in to absolutely everything is astonishing.

The queue times are SO short compared to most other major attractions and yet, despite this, the park will stay open longer if the queues are long throughout the day.

I am used to going to theme parks and being served by grumpy people who do not want to be there. Not at Europa - smiles by all the staff in their cleverly themed costumes on every ride.

The rides are enjoyable and fun with the perfect balance between exhilarating and entertaining.

I sincerely hope this park stays the same, as it is simply wonderful.

We visited Foodloop which is equally clever. Tasty food and drink.

The whole park as a whole is incredibly well priced. Even the alcohol is cheaper than where I live.

5 well earned stars!!!","Written September 8, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Great Theme Park ...but for smoking,"We bought the 2 day ticket and visited on a Saturday and Sunday. This park is really nice, good layout, attractions and decent food.

Only big issues is Smoking everywhere, even in places it is not allowed. Feels like people come here to smoke. There is no enforcement in non smoking areas. Management has to take this more seriously, Wonder how much revenue is lost if you completely ban smoking. I would even pay 1-2 EUR more on ticket...","Written September 8, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Best adventure park in Europe. Hands Down.,"Just brilliant, definitely beats Disneyland Paris, no contest. My view/tips:-
- Awesome rides; something for everyone and each one is different, sounds obvious but you know what I mean, there aren't 10 variations of the same theme;
- Waiting times are OK (and we went during high season) Tip: the lines are much reduced after about 4-5pm, we were hopping on rides in 5m that had needed 50 mins earleir in the day. 50 mins is the longest we waited for anything;
- SUPER clean, the bathrooms are spotless and considering the amount of traffic in this place, that's a super important detail
- Food in the hotel/service reastaurants is very good, the others not so much - not terrible, but you get what you pay for;
- One day is not really enough; we were there for two and it felt about right, but three would not be a waste of time;
- I saw lots of negative reviews that are related to people being allowed to smoke on site, I didn't notice it so much, it didn't bother me, so perhaps take with a pinch of salt, I don't think it's fair that this negates from all that is good about the place and drives down it's rating on aggregate. Just my opinion.
- Book parking in advance;
- Download the app and plan your day - it shows watiting times so you can be strategic about what you will do and when;
- The minimum height restrictions are not a good indicator of the intensity of rides, there were some small kids going on stuff I wouldn't have been comfortable with as a parent, but everyone is different and it's their choice.
- Beautiful architecture and ambience, real attention paid to the aesthetics
- In SW Germany, this means the weather is pretty good for much of the year so it's not as seasonal as some other parks in N.Europe.
- We're going back soon. It's the only place that I wanted to revisit so closely after the first time and I'm super picky and hard to please.","Written September 8, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Evening stroll over theme park with colleagues didn‚Äôt disappoint,"As we were having a conference in one of the neighboring hotels we were able to visit the park for free one hour before closure on 2 nights. First impressions were very positive with very many attractions at different thrill levels. We went to Wodan, CanCan, Blue Fire and Silver Star at the adult level and only had to wait around 20minutes other attractions like rafting were possible without waiting time. It also was obvious that there are very many food options, as well.
I am definitely planning to come back with my family","Written September 5, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Hectic 1 day visit with our 13 year old grandaughter,"Huge park, plenty to do, too much for 1 day, stayed till park closure.queues were orderly and entertained during wait. Rarely were the queues less than 1 hour for the ' big' rides. Grandaughter loved it, we were exhausted. However glad we had parked our 6m campervan at on-site camping park and avoided driving home at night. BUT Pitches chaotic, too small for most vans so multiple pitches taken for car, caravan and awning. Parked for less than 24 hours but charged for full day plus hours after midnight. Did not sample facilities or food, the area seemed very busy with people walking in road as large vehicles manoeuvered. Not the usual standard of German organisation.","Written September 4, 2019"

Germany,Europa-Park,Clean and large park,"Very clean and large them park with a good variety of attractions and various rollercoasters. That is if you manage to travel to Rust as it is not that conveniently located for travellers coming outside France, Germany or Switzerland. I was travelling with my family and for that reason I was unable to queue for the main coasters (damn shame) but they did look really nice. Our visit took place mid July so there were not that much queues other than for the main attractions. I think the longest queue we had with my daughter took 30 minutes but usually the queues were around 5 - 15 mins. I recommend downloading the Europa-Park App as that shows the queue times and helps you to plan your routes around the park. Despite being big, clean and having nice atmosphere for some reason it failed to tick all boxes for me so the question would I travel here again is just a maybe (and mainly because I have some Family in Germany). They are building a huge waterpark next to the amusement park that is due to complete November 2019 so that would probably be a nice place to visit next.","Written September 2, 2019"

Germany,Europa-Park,Great for families - needed more time.,"A wonderful place to visit and enjoyable for young and old alike. There are areas which are geared to specific ages which is a great idea and appreciated by my children spanning from young to teens. We visited for one day but it is definitely a place which needs at least two days to see and spend time at all the locations in the park.

As others have mentioned, what I would like to see implemented in the park is a FastPass system like the Disney Parks. But their free app and WiFi in the grounds is a fantastic concept giving you up to date information on the ride wait times and helps to locate friends within the park.

There are so many roller coasters and so many shows and street performers it‚Äôs a really amazing way to spend a day and had I the opportunity to spend two days, I would.

Food ranges from edible to quite good, for theirs stalls and takeaway areas and unfortunately I could not comment on their sit down type of restaurants. The price is just a little less from what I recall of Paris Disneyland.

I was travelling with my family and for that reason I was unable to queue for the main coasters (damn shame) but they did look really nice. Our visit took place mid July so there were not that much queues other than for the main attractions. I think the longest queue we had with my daughter took 30 minutes but usually the queues were around 5 - 15 mins. I recommend downloading the Europa-Park App as that shows the queue times and helps you to plan your routes around the park. Despite being big, clean and having nice atmosphere for some reason it failed to tick all boxes for me so the question would I travel here again is just a maybe (and mainly because I have some Family in Germany). They are building a huge waterpark next to the amusement park that is due to complete November 2019 so that would probably be a nice place to visit next.","Written September 2, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Wow,"Visited the park with two kids 9 and 6 year old. Was a great adventure. Went there on a rainy day, so the waiting lines were not too long. Was amazed by the variety of facilities.","Written September 1, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Great for families - needed more time.,"A wonderful place to visit and enjoyable for young and old alike. There are areas which are geared to specific ages which is a great idea and appreciated by my children spanning from young to teens. We visited for one day but it is definitely a place which needs at least two days to see and spend time at all the locations in the park.

As others have mentioned, what I would like to see implemented in the park is a FastPass system like the Disney Parks. But their free app and WiFi in the grounds is a fantastic concept giving you up to date information on the ride wait times and helps to locate friends within the park.

There are so many roller coasters and so many shows and street performers it‚Äôs a really amazing way to spend a day and had I the opportunity to spend two days, I would.

Food ranges from edible to quite good, for theirs stalls and takeaway areas and unfortunately I could not comment on their sit down type of restaurants. The price is just a little less from what I recall of Paris Disneyland.

The park is quite clean for the volume of people in this huge place.

Ticketing is similar to Disneyland and Parking is humongous, seemingly endless so don‚Äôt worry about running out of parking.","Written September 1, 2019"

Germany,Europa-Park,Absolute Must,"Spent the last two days visiting the park,with my family of 3 teenagers.
I have been to Disney but Europa Park beats them hands down.
The park is located in Southern Germany very near the French an Austrian border. Tickets are not overly priced and can be got on line or at the park gate prices are the same,we purchased ours at the park took 10 min in a queue very quick ,top tip if travelling by rental car,you pay on exit for car park buy your 7 euro ticket at entry of park ,saves messing about when tired after a long day in the park.
Picnics are encourage and there is plenty of areas to sit and eat same if you wish.
The park is themed on European countries and each section serves a variation of foods appropriate to that country.
All foods are fresh and very well priced.
The park is spotless and there is something going on in every corner of the park,one thing the park has in abundance is rides, and sometimes feels like a treasure hunt as smaller roller coasters river runs,vr experiences,shows etc are hidden away in different corners but well worth the time to seek them out.The one negative is the park map its cumbersome to understand and doesnt give a clear picture of the tons of activitys and rides available.
Do a bit of research if what's where and best things to see especially if your staying for one day.
The park has some massive roller coasters Silver Star been one of the biggest,do not miss it ,it lives up to its title and have not been on one better in Europe or Americia.
Top tip select your rides from smaller to the biggest as after the Silver Star it's hard to match the experience.
If you have time take a ride in the mini mono rail winds in and around the attractions great views.
Unlike other theme parks Europa Park doesn't give the hard sell feel.Come relax scare the pants off your self if you wish,find a shady corner have a beer relax and enjoy eat some food and watch the world go buy,up to you.
Queues at worst for top attractions 45 to 50 min on average smaller rides 25 min.If you have time hang around around 630 pm locals and school kids leave the park and queues drop to 5 to 10 min ,most big rides finish at 8 and the rest around 830.
After that evening shows start.
The park is worth a trip my teens are exhausted from a great two days there is
lot of sections for the younger kids.
We stayed in accommodation 10 min drive
from the park and drove in ,very organised and takes 15 min from hitting the park traffic to parking in in the car park looking up at the Sliver Star coaster as it's so big part of it is in the car park.Enjoy","Written August 22, 2019"

German efficiency in queues for sure. The food at lunchtime [we at in Greece] was good - not overly priced for theme parks. We caught the parade, which was fun, and the Disney equivalent, plus the diving show.

Germany,Europa-Park,Best Park IN THE WORLD,"We are from the U.S.A. We have been to all the big parks there, and this park blows them all away. The rides aren't as thrilling as Cedar Point, or as well themed as Disney. It isn't as cheap as Holiday World or as familiar as Six Flags. But overall, it is THE BEST. The theming of the rides and shows are great, the cost is not out of this world and there is something for everyone.

This parks takes a few days to explore thoroughly, but it's easy enough to do a one day and feel like you did a ton. The very best part of this place is that there are TWO ways to get to various parts around the park. The monorail and train take you all over, so at the end of the day you don't feel as exhausted as some other parks make you feel.

The very best part of this place is that while it can get busy, it never feels overwhelming like Disney World and some other parks often are. The crowds are well spread out and most people are pretty courteous.

My family unanimously agrees that pound-for-pound, this is the best park in the world.","Written August 14, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Amazing,I loved it and kids enjoyed it so much. You shouldn‚Äôt skip it if you have the chance to be in South western Germany or eastern France.,
Germany,Europa-Park,Wow - beats Eurodisney every day of the week,"Our kids (3 and 5 years old) had a bless from morning to evening two days in a row. Sooo many things to see and do - thrill rides, playgrounds, sightseeing trains and story rides. And for the rides suitable for small kids - seldom more than a 2-minute queue!

Compared to Eurodisney, there are waaaay more things to do, especially experiences other than big rides. Instead of big, wide walkpaths and empty squares between rides, every little corner of the park is filled with fountains, exhibitions, slides, lookout points and other things that create adventures for little ones. And a lot of it is interactive, not just about passively going along

And the park doesn‚Äôt seem to be designed just to make you spend more money (there are shops, caf√©s and restaurants, but they are fewer and less over-priced than we thought - and there is always a place nearby to eat your own pique-nique if you prefer).",
Germany,Europa-Park,Long wait times = minimal value for money,"We visited Europa park on a Tuesday hoping it would be slightly quieter, the rides and very cool and the park it‚Äôs self is clean and well designed, very very long ride times were a huge let down. For most rides the wait would be 40-90 minutes! It meant we could only do a few of the big rides, really overpriced considering how busy the park is :(","Written August 13, 2019"

Germany,Europa-Park,Fantastic theme park!,"This theme park is amazing. There are so many things to say about this place. The only ride I do not like is the wooden rollercoaster(I forgot what it was called) That ride hurt my neck. The queue on that ride is so long and boring it was a waste of time.
The food there is really nice. I was so jealous to eat it all, I couldn't even do it!
This place is perfect for young children, but I will warn you that some rides might be loud. If you are deaf, please be careful when riding.
There are so many rides here, I wish I could build something like this.
The water rides are brilliant to keep kids entertained. You may need a raincoat if you are allergic to water or if you don't want to get wet.
There is also a monorail and observatory if you want to get a better view of the park and it is safe so it won't fall.
There is also a virtual reality experience! But you have to book it though, I wish it was free.
There's a ride called Euro-Mir. It is a really crazy ROLLER-COASTER. At the start, you just go up and up like a stairway.
It is really shocking but it's safe. :)
The ride called Swiss Bob Run, that ride is insane. I was really confused on that ride because how can the cart stay on the white slide anyway?
There are also gentle rides for kids, some rides are brilliant for kids.
There is also a restaurant somewhere where you can choose whatever food you want! But you have to pay though, I wish it was free. The river rapids and log flume rides are awesome and very splashy. Enough to get me wet!
But apart from that this theme park is amazing. I shall visit again someday. Thanks for reading my review","Written August 12, 2019"

We took our 28yr son who has learning difficulties and stayed at The Bell Rock hotel.
We used the disabled friendly room on the ground floor, which is a larger room .
Very happy with the room.
The hotel provided us with a wheel chair as Ryanair had broken ours.

The Park is wonderful! VERY disabled friendly. There are obviously certain rides they are not accessible to those who cannot climb down in an emergency. The rides that we could go on provided entrance through the exit, providing you showed proof of disability. We had no problems. The only downer was the open air mono rail and the land train, these do not provide an area for wheel chairs or push chairs, so you have to return to your starting stations. The enclosed mono rail,‚Äô ep express‚Äô has a compartment at the end of the train for wheelchairs. If you went to the information place in the park each day , with proof of disability you can choose 6 rides that you can queue jump for the disabled person and four family members, we didn‚Äôt need to use this, but it makes it fair for all in the park.
The park is a beautiful place with lots of areas of shade , and also water splash areas to cool your feet or for the children to play in.
Shows are good and again, provision is made for the disabled, The Paddington ice show had plenty of seats marked for the disabled, all be it at the sides of the rink... But still good.

The reason seems straightforward - that they want people to buy drinks - but shows a crass and gratuitous disrespect for the environment. A policy that precludes a totally waste-free option in favour of something that creates a mountain of unnecessary waste with a substantial carbon footprint is one that the management of the park should be ashamed of. I urge them to reconsider this damaging policy.","Written August 2, 2019"

The park is accessible for people with wheelchairs. But not for all kind of type of wheelchairs. Special the one with smaller wheels is dangerous. It's easily to get stocked between the border and the attraction or railway platform. In the beginning at the Spanish side are casseien that have wide joints. This means that you are shaken considerably in the wheelchair.

If you want to have a drink or bite in the restaurant who are situated higher then you have to find wheelchair ramp. This could sometimes better announced.

But still it's a great park and lots to do.

Staff is perfect and helps you if necessary.","Written July 28, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Wow!,"The best original, organized and well maintained park, we have ever visited. It offers not only variety of rides, but the opportunity to meet different countries ' atmosphere and facts. It was a great experience for our 6 year old son. From Basel airport the best way to travel is by car. At the park there is Sixt office. We stayed at Bell Rock hotel, there are plenty of benefits, if you stay at one of the park resorts: earlier access, later exit, VIP entrance etc.","Written July 27, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Always a success!,"This theme park has it all! We come here as we are driving to France from Sweden. We bring our dog and we love rollercoasters, so using the baby switch service for the dog was awesome! Just make sure to make both of you seen by the person at the entrance together and get the ticket.
It was an very hot day and water is accessible all over the park for cooling off and also bowls of drinking water for the dog. The only thing missing would be the drinking fountains for humans so we would not have to buy plastic bottles of water all the time ( not very good for the environment )

We will definitely come again, we love the Silver Star and the Blue line, great rides. We laugh every time at the huge shark in the Scandinavian area as we never heard of any such creatures being seen in Scandinavia, although whales in northern Norway is common.

We usually find a place to stay near Rust and it is never a problem. We have left bicycles on the back of the car in the parking and that to had not been a problem.",
Germany,Europa-Park,"Awesome amusement park near Freiburg, Germany","This is one of my top three amusement parks overall. I love the MIR ride (a roller coster). If you can manage, go off-season and avoid July/August. Check for opening times in spring and fall, they are not open all-season. You can easily spend a full day in the park. Food from outside the park is not allowed. Most of the people who work in the park speak German, French and English, often also other European languages. Enjoy!","Written July 25, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Wonderful Experience,"One of the best theme parks we have been to and way ahead of Disneyland in Europe and up there with the equivalents in Florida.

Wonderful way for a family to spend the day with plenty of rides that suit people of all ages and all levels of bravery.

German efficiency means that the place works exceptionally well.

Plenty of places to relax and enjoy the weather given that today had temperatures on 38 degrees.

What was really refreshing was that there is real value to be had on food and drink, plenty of options for all tastes in each of the country locations.

Fast food for five around ‚Ç¨40 with large beers at only ‚Ç¨3.50 and waters at ‚Ç¨3.00 so all pricing very good and food fine for what it was.

Really enjoyable experience and would highly recommend.

Germany,Europa-Park,For the whole family,"Very good themepark for the whole family. Many shows, rollercoasters and entertainment. So much, you can't do everything in one day. Even on a busy day, the cues keep moving. We went on a Saturday in high season and our longest cue was 45 minutes, not much for a rollercoaster.

The only negative thing is the entrance price, which is with 52 euros quite expansive. Even for a second day access, there is no discount. Strange!

The park is good accessible for people in a wheelchair and there are enough toilets.","Written July 21, 2019"

The rides were amazing, we started with Blue Fire and it just kept getting better and better. The park itself is beautiful, very clean and the attention to detail is out of this world. Food and drink is very reasonable, usually we would take a picnic but no need on this occasion. J would recomend this park to everyone as it has something for the whole family.

Germany,Europa-Park,Best theme park we ever been,"Definetely this is the best park we ever been! We love theme parks and this one is great. A lot of diferents rides, themed areas, great staff and reasonable prices. It wasn't crowed when we went and that made the experience better. We spent the whole day (from 9 to 19) and we couldn't see all, so is recommended to stay a couple of days. Unfortunatelly there's not a great discount in the two days ticket.",
Germany,Europa-Park,3 adults in Europe's Best Park!,"Went in beginning of mid July 10 and 11th. The park is a mixture of Disney World and Busch Gardens Williamsburg. The park is very family friendly but also enough going on that it works very well for adults and thrill riders. It is the cleanest park I have ever seen! It rained both days I went BUT it was like Florida weather...rain for couple minutes then sun rest of day with perfect temp. It helped keep crowds down also! Longest line I waited in was 30 minutes. This was due to a minor issue (kid got scared or something). Full warning, if you go in high season...the lines will wrap around and around. They constructed like a maze for almost every ride. Be prepared! Nice thing for those long waits they have built in little buildings along the way for refreshments and cooling down. I love rollercoasters and Silver Star is amazing. It is an amplified version of the ride Apollo in Bush Gardens. The first drop is higher and drops down with out the mini bump Apollo has. It also seemed longer ride too, which was nice! Everything is sectioned off in different countries like Bush Gardens and done very well. The water rides are fun and the water did not smell! First time for everything! Food is typical amusement park but they have more flare and beauty to them (sit down places). It is slightly over priced but that is nothing new. The other attractions are great. I ended up doing two day visit. We came in to Rust midday and then went to park late. There was no way we could get to everything in 3 hours. By the way, park closes either 6pm or 7pm, if you ever visit around time I did. Park extends their hours when the season peaks. Second day we did a full day. I think it depends what your interests are (shows, type of rides, etc) and how many people/ kids are with you to decide if you need two day or one day. Mine was worth it because of late arrival and first time going there. I wanted to take my time and really check everything out (tickets are not cheap- just like Disney and Bush Gardens). If you have been there or know you only like certain rides and certain shows, you can easily plan everything out for one day. Just arrive when park opens is my only recommendation! Parking is interesting. I stayed at a guesthaus near by the park and they gave us free parking ticket- general not VIP. It is only for one day. We walked the first day to the park (super close and ideal way to do it if you are staying close by) and parked second day at park. It was 7 euros-pay at leaving. Hotels on the park get their own entrance section and also have their own parking garages. If you are coming in without staying overnight, they have a lot of parking and overflow parking. You can exit park and come back in (tried it, they take your picture and use your ticket to scan, so dont lose it!). I did not notice any flash passes or jump the line passes. I think this park is traditional wait in one line. Some rides do offer single rider or front row riding. Definitely worth the trip to take (at least once)!!!",
Germany,Europa-Park,Greta Park but lacking responsibilty towards nature,"Overall a great experience, however we were shocked to see that there is not enough emphasis on keeping the natural environment for wild life. We witnessed 3 ducklings being seperated from their mother in one of the water rides (Poseidon) and after confronting the staff we were told there is nothing they can do! The staff even said it happens ALL the time and that they die often in the waters as well.
It should be unacceptable to ruin the living environment of animals like that and in the future we hope there are ways implemented to keep the wild life around the park safe. It was heartbreaking to see the duck mother screaming for her ducklings and watching them struggle in the waters were they could not get out of as they cannot fly yet.","Written July 14, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Had a great time,Second time visiting the park. We had a good time. It‚Äôs a nice amusement park. Good mix of rides and the lines weren‚Äôt too bad.,"Written July 12, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Europes nr 1 amusement park!,"Well, every time we are here we get positively surprised by how the park is run.
How about that one of the big attractions (Voletarium) opens before the park itself as a bonus? The closure time is also adjusted depending on how much people there is in the park. Just to make sure you have the time you need to do all the rides you want.

There are attractions for young and old and what is so good is the amazing capacity on the rides. 1750 per hour in Silver Star f.ex makes Europa-Park THE only park where you ride instead of queue for hours!

Reasonable prices for the food so you won‚Äôt get robbed üëç

Germany,Europa-Park,We liked it a lot!,"Great roller coasters. Good waiting areas. It was a bit tricky to find the way although there were signs... but maybe not enough.
We went to the park on a Wednesday which turned out to be good. Not too long to wait. Reasonable prices for food and drinks. If you have younger kids, plan to spend two days here. If you have older kids who only wants to go on the thrilling rides, then one day was good enough for us.","Written July 11, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Hard to navigate,"I have know this park my entire life. It keeps getting bigger, it keeps adding awesome attractions, but I am not sure the overall experience is getting better.
This is an expensive place to get into and even parking there feels steep. Once in, since this is very popular park, lines for the rides can easily average an hour, most of which is spent in sometimes difficult conditions (in direct sun, in non ventilated tunnels, etc...). This is tiring an puts a damper on the fun. I feel the park should invest in making the lines more comfortable, by adding shaded areas, as well as making indoor lines air conditioned, or at least ventilated.
Food and drinks in the park are expensive as expected, but not ludicrous. The park is very clean, and that's important for something like the bathrooms.
What is maybe the most annoying part is that navigating the park is a real hassle. The place is very large, and attractions are spread out as one would expect, However, the trails are winding all over the place, and even with a map, it is almost always hard to find a direct way to a particular area or attraction. This adds a significant amount of fatigue too. It's easy to get turned around, or end up in dead ends, and that's really not something one wants.","Written July 9, 2019"

Germany,Europa-Park,Best Amusement Park in the World?,"Me, my wife and our 5 year old son visited the park as part of our month long Europe trip and all 3 of us agreed that this was the most memorable part of our trip.
Even with a 5 year old, there were enough rides and entertainment to keep us busy all day. The rides were great, even for those limited to 5 year olds. We all thought the Voletarium was the best of the lot but we had a lot of fun with the other rides too.
We went to a couple of shows and they were all good quality.
The food in the park was good, there was a good choice of food and the prices weren't too bad.
We went there in mid-May on a weekday, so it wasn't crowded at all. We only had to wait for a few minutes for most rides while the very popular ones were about 15 minutes. I'm sure it gets much more crowded during peak season.
If possible, try staying in one of the hotels attached to the park. We checked into the hotel the day before our full day in the park and was given a free visit to the park for the last hour of the day (5 to 6pm). That was enough time to cover a few rides. The hotels themselves are awesome but that's another review.
I assume most people would have drove to the park but it's also accessible by public transport.
The operator of this park should get commended for getting it right. This is a great amusement park, easily the best we have been. I highly recommend staying at least one night at one of their hotels (bring your bathers as their pool are awesome!).","Written June 21, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Outstanding,"An outstanding theme park with great rides, shows, food and drink and landscaping. I cannot recommend it highly enough. The only niggles are the lack of free/cheap water (‚Ç¨3 a bottle!!) and the prevalence of smoking in the park - but that's probably a cultural thing.

The surroundings are spectacular and just walking around in the park is a pleasure in itself. A bit disappointing was the kebab in the Greek fast food restaurant but the rest of the food we had ranged from good to excellent, both within the Park and in the Hotels.","Written June 15, 2019"

Germany,Europa-Park,Nice BUT ...,"I would definitely recommend this place as one of the main attraction if you are nearby. It has nice views from different rides and a good number of rides.

I would strongly recommend that you download their application as it would ease your visit by filtering the rides by either the level, age or type of amusement. It gives you exactly where the next ride is and the waiting time of each. I couldn‚Äôt imagine that we would finish 9 rides in 5 hours (and we went for the difficult madness ones).

Another advantage that gives Europa-Park its fantastic image, is the idea of allocating different countries and designs for different areas for example you can enjoy the Greek architecture in one area, and British one in another area and so many others.

However, one thing I would say that I found it as a negative point; The organisation and assembly of most of the games. We expect that at the end of the line of each ride that an assemblyman would organise the tourists in a perfect way, but it turned to be that the tourists themselves can go to whatever line they want which causes some mess in some games. Only two games were organised (Blue fire and Wooden).

One thing which is relatively bad for me, is that the nature and landscape around that park is not as astonishing as I expected. They are just okayish for me.",

The park is so big that it even has a train to help you roam around easier. Thank god! Overall this park was good. It provides an app so you can track the amount of waiting time which helps a lot.
Complaints I would have is the lack of possibility to buy water throughout the park! They sell more ice creams that water. Also the lack of personnel to ask questions. Everything is self service and after a exhausting day sometimes you just want to be SERVED!
Also we do not speak German. Having more choices in French/English would be nice.
Overall if you can make it we highly recommend it. Just plan the right time to go or else you will spend your day staying in 60 minutes lines for each ride.There is not much to do at Rust at all.

Germany,Europa-Park,Would have been 5 stars if not for the smoking!,"We took a 3 night / 2 day park ticket package and stayed at the Hotel Colosseo (see separate review). As theme parks go, it's difficult to top as there is something for everyone, whether you're a thrill seeker or are there with little ones. We're not Disney fans so it was nice not to have the over the top mawkishness you get from that experience. We were there for UK May half-term - the queues were really short / non existent, so in the space of the 2 days (including taking advantage of the early entry for hotel guests), we rode about 30 times. I can imagine though, looking at the way the queuing system was organised, that the queues in the summer would be a shocker and there didn't seem to be a fast pass system. Food was of a reasonable standard and not a rip off. Good veggie options. We ate at Food Loop twice purely for the novelty factor. Now, here's the but - the smoking... with the exception of the queues and inside restaurants, smoking was allowed everywhere. I feel like I spent 2 days walking around in a nicotine coma a d it really wasn't pleasant... to the point where it would be a major factor in deciding whether to return. Come on Europa Park - you're a family attraction... have separate smoking areas for those that choose to smoke and protect the health of those of us who choosr not to! Finally, I had read some negative reviews about the early entry for hotel residents - I'm not sure if they have changed it but there was access to about 6 different rides as part of this while we were there... as the hotel guests enter the park from the completely opposite end to day ticket holders, my advice would be to stay in that part of the park well past opening time and hit some of the rides there before the queues build!","Written May 30, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Best Theme Park So Far,"Having been to a number of theme parks over the years (Eurodisney, Anaheim, Universal Studios in L.A., WB on the Gold Coast ...), I find Europapark the best. Excellent layout, very good queue management, tasty, reasonably priced snacks, and, most importantly, really cool rides. Will visit again.","Written May 28, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Smoking ruins a great park,"This would have been a great experience had the park not allowed smoking in the restaurants and punlic areas of the park. Unfortunately, the smoke was pervasive and offensive, ruining what would have been a wonderful day. We were planning to spend three days here, but now hesitate to return due to the smoking.

As for the rides, Voletareum is essentially Soarin' over Europe and quite fun. Can Can coaster is Space Mountain. Arthur won an award and is not to be missed. The Frau Feudenreich dinosaur ride is well done, but a few of the other dark rides are not as impressive. There are many coasters at all thrill levels.

Most of the restaurant menus are only in German and French, not English. Many rides have few attendants, and require you to select a row for yourself. It isn't always clear how to keep your party together.

The landscaping is very nice and food prices are quite reasonable compared to most US theme parks. The park and its food stands closed at 6:30pm, but we found a good kebab and pizza stand just outside the entrance that stayed open later.","Written May 27, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Fantastic Place for young and Old,"Perfect place, perfect for the entire family. No need to queuing too long, everywhere playground, Restaurant, and nice Ambiance. Highly recommended.",
Germany,Europa-Park,AMAZING!,"The whole park was fantastic! Well maintained and beautiful. With friendly staff able to speak English we felt very at ease here! Visiting during May the park was quiet which meant short or no queues in the park! We accessed everything we wanted to and more!! Hopping in and out of rides as we passed them! We ate in many places and again feel it was clean and very reasonably priced! We will definitely go back!! Perfect for groups, families, couples and chills too!","Written May 24, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,"Amazing-Fantastic Attractions, Park and Rides","via A5 gefahren von Frankfurt f√ºr circa 2 und halb stunden mit dem Auto. The Parking area have designated numbers so you can identify where you had parking. The Parking cost is 7 Euro and can pay directly together with the Entrance ticket in the Cashier. You can find Park Plans right after the cashier booth. Seniors and Adults and Kids have different fee.
And check your ticket maybe at times entitled for a free slice of cake at Schloss Balthasar in Deutschland point. That¬¥s worth it!
Never Never miss to experience the attraction ""VOLETARIUM"" it was a long wait for us but that was the finale and I had even teardrops for that amazing impact and effect and fireworks with. I cannot move on until now.... that was so mega toll!!!
4D Cinema is also so lively and real. The Flucht die Alexandra is also enjoyable with matching a little bit horror but funny. Plenty Kiddie rides in the water, Jim Knopf train rides, London Bus ride etc. etc.
In Luxemburg point where the Drehttheater (rotating theater) give the ""Rulantica"" premier is also a must-watch. Mission Astronaut is very informative.
Madam Freudenreich ride is so cool and nice and you can have a souvenir photo while riding for cost 3 Euro. Make sure you have plenty coins with you for photo souvenir, can only from the auto machine printing when you like it. Other rides with photos cost only 2 Euro.
It is more exciting and fun to rides the rollercoaster for teens and with those water rides just be sure to bring your jacket or raincoat with you or extra T-shirt because you will really get wet.
Comfortable shoes is highly recommended for walking. Kids will certainly love here and even Aged like us but not to rides coaster anymore. Just enjoy the train rides and walking and sight seeing all the scenic wonder point view in every 16 Europa countries and restaurants and souvenir shops.
Give also plenty shows but when the time not pass then just go further for the other attractions and have photos or videos. 1 day is enough to roam around the Park for us and for a big family with kids maybe 2 days worth.
Check my Hotel recommendation in Hotel Engel, it is just 9 mins. from Park and affordable with breakfast.
Europa Park is perfectly Amazing and Fantastic! and happiness all the ways....",
Germany,Europa-Park,Good shows,"Good shows available but feel the best show not worth your time. Paddington on ice is good but needed to b
Be more Paddington relevant as was based on roads rather then trains. Lovely theme park with flowers everywhere and nice scenery with the fountains in the France area. It's a 2 day theme park to get everything done. Bug wooden ride my favourite. Not the best variety of food available. Mainly pizza. The Arthur ride is amazing wow definitely a ride to do and get the green drink their too. Highly recommend as a whole.",
Germany,Europa-Park,Better than Florida,"It's just as big as any of the Florida parks, rides are as good or better too.. It's better organised in terms of getting in, you don't need to leave absolutely everything like your phone and wallet in a locker for the big rides (like Florida). The food is actually good and it's cheap - Burger, fries and drink for 10eur.
It's fairly relaxed in terms of letting kids on the bigger rides within the realms of common sense.
It's just really good.. If you live in Europe, you should go.","Written May 20, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Best in the world,"I visited Europa Park for the first time on Tuesday 14th-Wednesday 15th March with my Girlfriend and our friend. I‚Äôve been lucky enough to get to a few major theme parks such as Disneyland Paris, Portaventura in Salou & the Florida theme parks and I can say 100% this is the best theme park I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of visiting.

We arrived by car about half an hour after park opening and managed to get parked without any hassle. There is a bag check area before you reach the turnstiles however this took very little time to pass through. Our friend hadn‚Äôt pre purchased a ticket and thus had to get one on the gate, this cost no more than buying in advance and again took minimal time. The entrance plaza is well laid out with several ticket kiosks in operation. I would however recommend getting there earlier & buying in advance on a weekend as I‚Äôm sure it will be much busier than when we went in midweek!

Once inside the theming is unbelievably well done and you could easily spend a full day walking around from country to country taking in all the little details. Food & Drink is more reasonably priced than most other parks I‚Äôve visited (a beer only costs around 3‚Ç¨ which is great for the adults!). Most staff speak English however a nice touch is that the staff have the flags of the languages they speak on their nametags which is very helpful. The park is even dog friendly and we saw many people walking their dogs which I‚Äôve never seen in any other theme park.

The ride lineup is brilliant with something for all ages, from big rollercoasters such as Wodan (our personal favourite), Silver Star & Blue Fire, to a fantastic selection of several water rides, to a vast lineup of other rides, of which the standouts were the ghost train Geisterschloss (not one for those who scare easy), Voletarium (one of the most impressive simulators out there) & the amazing Arthur (do not miss this one!). There are also several walk through attractions (a real hidden gem was the lazer obstacle course next to the train station in the England area) and some spectacular play areas & slides which made us all wish we were still kids so we could have a go!

Although the park wasn‚Äôt exactly bursting at full capacity due to the fact it was a weekday we were still heavily impressed with how quickly the staff get the queues moving, we only waited about 5-10 minutes for the biggest rides on the first day which was amazing & although the second day was far busier the wait times rarely exceeded 15-20 minutes. The park does not operate any kind of fastpass system which definitely helps get the main queues moving quicker. The queues themselves are for the most part very detailed similar to those at Disney & Universal parks with plenty to look at to pass the time if it is a long wait.

Overall its just an amazing place full of passionate people who seem to actually care about the guest experience and don‚Äôt just see you as a walking wallet unlike most other major theme parks. We will definitely be back to see the waterpark once it opens as if it‚Äôs even half as good they‚Äôll be on to a winner!","Written May 17, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Incredible,"Really beautiful park, we spent two days here and still didn‚Äôt quite manage everything. I imagine with children you might not manage everything as there is so much, whereas we could leave most of the kids rides. We were lucky on day one and only had 5-15 minute waits on all the big rides. All of the restaurants, ice cream places etc inside are also very reasonably priced not extortionate like some big theme parks. Had a wonderful time",
Germany,Europa-Park,french-german staff‚Äôs DISASTER towards foreigners,"You need to seriously have a talk with your staff members about how to treat foreigners. Today, 13.05.2019 there was a moment when fjord rafting attraction was closed, we didn‚Äôt know and we were walking towards the entrance when a man working (standing) there put his hand to stop me and screamed at me in dutch or french, he told me something and I said sorry, I don‚Äôt understand, but my friend did and he told me back that that‚Äôs my problem and I should learn german or french here. I didn‚Äôt understand his response right then and said again, I‚Äôm sorry, I can speak Russian, Spanish, English, or Latvian, (and I was saying that smiling because I really didn‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs the problem that he‚Äôs not letting us through) and I‚Äôm definitely not planning to learn dutch or french to come to a freakin amusement park... and he just screamed CLOSED - French or german! And just looked at me like a complete idiot. Arrogance and absolute rudeness! I mean, I understand I shouldn‚Äôt wait for a high level of intelligence there, but since he was 40+ years old (that I cannot understand), he was trying to be very important! Well, it just left me a feeling of not being interested in coming there again. You need a system for clients to be able to say something about specific people who work there. Name tags, something. Because honestly- do you need a person like that working for you? This park is visited by whole europe and other parts of the world, no one freakin cares about german which is used in practically 1 country or even more french since I haven‚Äôt spotted any Canadians around. Paddington bear on ice was a great show, but we couldn‚Äôt understand anything. Is it that hard to put English subtitles? Most part of the world speaks english.

- Then a huge problem to be bring your park to the next level are the costumes, make up, hair of your workers. I mean the show 2 times 2, dancers literally had white bra under black dresses, different make up etc., but the worst was the pirates ship walking around the park. Dear God. The actors looked so bad. Make up was horrible, hair horrible, clothes like from the thrift shop. I mean you need to figure this out and have some training for the actors. They were acting just...bad. And everyone felt awkward since they did not believe anything they were doing themselves. (A lot of costume clothes were dirty), pants for the man on high sticks, literally with dirt on his but. This is a thing you should check from disney.

- FOOD. Why haven‚Äôt you keeping themes in food courts as well? Spain - burgers, Africa - burgers, London - burgers. Same plates, cutlery, food. Boring and plain. I would suggest you seriously think more into detail of food and provide maps for food so people could go to Austria and get an apple strudel or France for fries, baguettes etc. burgers tasted good, price was too high for that tho. (Africa).

I think you although should find a way to separate the worlds more, because we couldn‚Äôt where we are and if we‚Äôve entered a new ones.

Add to the map rating for each roller coaster, I don‚Äôt like the really crazy ones, but lots of times we had no idea what‚Äôs it‚Äôs going to be like, like moulin rouge. Just waiting and waiting in line and wondering. It was not that bad, but I was so stressed out by that time of not knowing what to expect that I couldn‚Äôt enjoy.

Although SMOKING!!!! Like WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL? HOW can you allow smoking almost ANYWHERE in the park? Pregnant woman, kids, normal people who don‚Äôt want to have cancer? Hello?! Make a special places for smoking, so they can all sit there and ruin each others health. I inhaled more smoke than in a bar. Disgusting that you allow this, absolutely.

To sum this all up! I think there are still A LOT you can do to improve your park. If you want to be the best park in Europe or maybe even world? Start with staff. Get rid of anyone who interacts with people rudely. It‚Äôs not a thing of not understanding a language it‚Äôs a thing of being stupid enough to be proud of it! I promise you, someone 1000% experienced the same thing as us with the same person. Find him and fire him. Find young, smart and happy people who love what they do and pay them not to hate everyone. And please, dear God, hire a costume artist and stylist for your actors. It‚Äôll make SUCH a big difference.

And although you‚Äôre missing a little magic there like a little surprise moment, kind of like the guys with the ship, but only something nice. Like small magic shops with magic shows or something. Because it was kinda sad seeing every possible house filled with boring souvenirs and restaurants.

All together - park is good. I‚Äôve been to universal studios hollywood, universal studios orlando, paris disneyland more than once, Malaysia sunway lagoon etc., and I know what I‚Äôm talking about so just yes, park is good, but you can‚Äôt stop evolving it! Or it‚Äôs going to burst into nothing. And no one wants that!

Don‚Äôt hesitate to contact for more details and help, I feel like you‚Äôre in desperate need of foreign minds.",
Germany,Europa-Park,Beautiful park with great attractions,"The park is beautiful, the flowers and landscaping are gorgeous and the decorations in each area are brilliant. They have some big rollercoasters but we prefer the gentler rides and there were loads suitable for all ages, we especially loved the Voletarium. Food was good quality and reasonably priced for a theme park, and the monorails helped us to get around as the park is BIG and we found the map and signage a bit confusing! We also loved the shows, especially the Rulantica musical and Paddington on Ice, and the acrobatic show was amazing. We bought the 2-day ticket and didn't get to see everything, would definitely like to visit the park again in the future.","Written May 13, 2019"

Germany,Europa-Park,Amazing,"This is my second time giving a rating for Europa Park and I feel like if you need to read reviews for it, then you do not like having fun. It is absolutely worth every penny or Cent to go here and there are always new attractions being added. If there are any questions that you have about going to the park, you can call them or you can download the app. After downloading the app and comparing it to the map they give you at the front, I believe the map is more useful than the app. The app is good at telling you where all the local restaurants are as well as what time the shows are.

I love going here and it's very magical","Written May 7, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,Exceptional,"Visited in August with partner and two girls aged 2 and 7. Despite the cheesy EU theme (Euromaus, French sidekick) I would rate it higher than Magical Kingdom in Orlando based on visitor experience (including quality of rides, cleanliness, waiting times, amenities etc). Plenty to do for kids 4 and above and adults. Volaterium was amazing. Planning our next trip already.

For those traveling from the UK, flying to Basel followed by a quick drive up to the park is likely to be the cheapest and quickest option","Written May 6, 2019"

Loved the attention to detail in the attractions, really amazing!
Food on offer was good and reasonably priced (compared to Disneyland).
Loved the fact that it's NOT Disney-style themed: the tour around Europe is really a nice change vs. traditional hero themes. So much effort to make them unique.

Ended up staying a second day which was really worthwhile (wish we had bought the 2-day pass in the first place... would have made it cheaper overall).

Net, definitely recommend and would go again!","Written May 1, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,So much fun!,It was an absolutely amazing experience to walk in the park with so many cultures and those attractions so well-organised. Definitely go to the Silverstar and Blue fire. You can get all sort of food there. The toilets were very clean. Wait times 20min-1hour. Those went pretty fast. There are so many things to see.

Germany,Europa-Park,Just about waiting,"Has to wait up to one hour and 20 minutes for a single attraction, despite displayed waiting time of 50 minutes.

Germany,Europa-Park,Smoker's Paradise would make a more appropriate name!,"SMOKERS EVERYWHERE!!!!

From the moment you leave your car, to the moment you are back in it, all you will smell is cigarette smoke. There are smokers EVERYWHERE you go. They are in front and behind you as you walk from the parking lot to the entrance. SMOKERS are around you at all times as you walk around the park, eat, or wait for your rides.

Smoking is forbidden in all waiting areas and on rides. However, no one is there to stop smokers from lighting up. Even when we left 4 meters of space between us and the smoker, they continued to smoke. Even when the No Smoking On Line announcement was heard in three languages, the smokers continued to smoke. There was no staff anywhere to be seen that we could call over. The smokers just laughed as we waved their disgusting smoke out of our faces.

Everywhere you go, you will walk through a cloud of noxious cigarette smoke. There are children of all ages breathing all of this in. You see parents holding infants or pushing carriages while smoking. They eat while smoking. They sit while smoking. The entrances and exits of rides are full of smokers.

So while some of the rides were great, we will not return to this park until there is a complete smoking ban put in place as it exists in Euro Disney. In fact, next time, we'll go to Euro Disney instead.

As for the rest of the park, it's beautiful. The rides we did were great: Volatarian, Valerian, Arthur and Alpine Coastiality were our favorites...in that order. We also did other rides that were fun, but not worth the 60 minute wait.

The food at the park was less than mediocre. I wonder if this is done on purpose so that you are never satisfied with anything, so you keep eating. Just pack your own food and get some ice-cream there.

While the rides were run well and we felt secure, we noticed that there was rarely any staff around the park nor park characters. We didn't see any park characters until the end and they were all near the exit.

We used the app but it was not good at giving directions. It merely showed you a path, but you couldn't figure out where to go since it didn't change as you walked. I ended up judging by the change in meters, but sometimes, the direct route was through a ride, so it increased while walking on the path in any direction. We eventually found where to go by trial and error, but a better working app, having staff there to point out the way or even signs with the top rides would be useful.

This park could be amazing with a few changes. They should ban smoking and have enclosed areas for those who like to poison themselves. They should improve the food and add some staff to help guide you to the rides you want. For me, the smoking problem is the deal breaker. I would have given 5 stars if not for all the smoke.","Written April 24, 2019"

A huge variety of food at very reasonable prices.

You need 2 days here to get full benefit.

The reason not 5 stars was the smoking. In 2019 how can they allow people to smoke anywhere except in the ride queues? They should have designated smoking areas.","Written April 13, 2019"

Germany,Europa-Park,Fantastic Park,"Europa Park is an incredible park, that is enjoyable for ANY age, even pensioners. The themed areas are authentic and beautiful, and the food is top quality and in sync with the different themes across the park. I would recommend 3 days here, as it allows time to ride all 13 roller coasters (as of 2019), all dark rides and time to relax. It is very well signed and the map is easy to read - it comes in several languages including English just like the signage and restaurant menus. It makes me wonder why the park is so unheard of here in the UK and the US. Some of my favourite attractions include Bluefire Megacoaster, Wodan, Poseidon, Geisterschloss, ARTHUR and Alpenexpress. To be honest, nearly all the rides are my favourite, it's so hard to choose!

The park installs new attractions every year consistently and new developments are always being made, a notable one being the new water park being developed closely near by at the resort. Unfortunately during 2018 a large chunk of the Scandinavian village and an indoor pirates-themed boat ride named Piraten In Batavia burned to the ground, but visitors will soon be able to experience these attractions again as the park are already redeveloping the land to rebuild better more up to date versions of these classic attractions Definetely an underrated park in my eyes, I would totally recommend a visit!","Written March 6, 2019"
Germany,Europa-Park,If there is one park to visit in Europe,"It's that one. I have been going there for a long time, and although it shows that some attractions are getting older, it's still lots and lots of fun with lots of new attractions each year.
One of the drawbacks is that it's a very popular park, so don't go on a bank free holiday or a week-end, as the queues can easily go up to more than an hour. The old attractions have a shorter queue, and although they may be shorter (and less thrilling, for adrenaline junkies!), they are still good times.","Written February 25, 2019"

Germany,Green Vault,"Priceless collection of uniquely crafted art, laced with diamonds, rubies, intricate carvings.","I was there in Oct 2019, a month or so before thieves broke in and stole about a hundred artifacts. I love art in it's many forms and creative manifestations, and you'd be hard-pressed to find anything that tops this collection, even after the scumbag thieves attacked it.
There's so much of it that it is overwhelming to take in. Over 1.1 billion of bejeweled art was stolen, but there's a lot left to see, despite that. You walk from air-controlled rooms thru the entire floor of the building. It is a remarkable architectural wonder, as well, it being restored to its original splendor before the needless fire-bombing of Dresden on Feb 13-15, 1945.
August the Strong was the main man responsible for this massing of treasures, and his vision to create such a collection, was astounding to say the least. So were his deep pockets.
NOTE- There is so much art within a few sq miles of downtown Dresden, you also need to hit the museums that houses the Raphael, as well as TWO Vermeers, as well as the Porcelain museum. All near each other.
I am hoping security is MUCH BETTER in the future for these great works of art.

Old Green Vault - This contains beautiful artifacts and treasures which have been collected over the years. Each room has a different themed display and it is stunning to walk through.

Germany,Green Vault,"Amazingly Opulent, But Also See the ""New"" Green Vault","Largely unknown to Americans, in the early 1700s Dresden was the home of a fabulously wealthy Elector of Saxony known as Augustus the Strong, who also went on to become king of Poland. He and his family collected many thousands of intricate, fascinating, and valuable objects that are on display on multiple museums across the compact old town.

The Green Vault is a set of approximately 6 rooms showcasing the most opulent of these items (which is saying quite a lot). It contains many items showing off the wealth of the family and the great cleverness of the jewelers and artisans who made the objects. These include massive baroque drinking glasses, a large cabinet made of amber, many statues and figures made of precious and semiprecious materials, and so on. The display is on a rough par with the Faberge eggs and designs created for the Romanov family 200 years later. It's difficult to imagine this place without seeing it.

The Green Vault is but a part of the former residence palace. You have to buy a special timed ticket to get in. We did so on line in advance. We arrived first thing in the morning and the crowds were light.

Security for this part of the building is very tight. You'll need to check your bags (even large purses), coat and larger cameras. No photos are allowed here, likely for both security and crowd control reasons, but there are many postcards and books available in the large gift shop. Most of the photos on this site are actually from the ""new green vault"" described below, which has much easier access. You actually need to go through double sets of doors with a wait time to get in or out, and there is roughly one guard per room.

There is an extensive audio guide. My one complaint is that there was little in the way of other descriptive material and there frequently was no audio for the items I found most interesting. The displays are behind impossibly clear glass - one member of our party didn't even realize the glass was there - so the views are very clear.

We thought it was impressive both as a display of the individual objects, but also collectively as the demonstration of August the Strong's wealth and power, which couldn't be missed by anyone.

While the Green Vault is well worth seeing, there are other parts of the residence palace (I think it's all one ticket, other than the special ticket for the Green Vault itself). Most importantly, you will want to visit the ""new green vault"" one level above it. It also has many intricate objects, some perhaps not as valuable, but it includes the one-of-a-kind green diamond (I don't like jewels as a rule, but this one is amazing). It also has the large, detailed figurine display of the mogul Aurangzeb's birthday celebrations. It took a team of jewelers and designers 6 years to build and has over 5,000 diamonds as well as large quantities of other gems. You can buy an entire book on it in the gift shop.

There are other displays within the residence palace. Perhaps the most interesting of these is the armor display, which goes on for many rooms. Others, such as coins, are likely to be of less interest to many visitors.

They showed the curiosity and talents of humans on various subjects. The Armory was also impressive. It showed how much ingenuity people generated for the purpose of wars in those few hundred years.

We were required to check all coats and bags, including cameras to enter the green vault. The lines were long so plan time if the sight is busy.

Germany,Green Vault,Fascinating for both its collection of treasures and remarkable reconstruction,"On the first floor of Dresden Castle, the original Green Vault was founded in 1723 by Augustus the Strong as a public museum. It now houses some 3,000 treasures, many of which are examples of remarkable craftsmanship.

It is well worth spending a couple of hours meandering through the ten rooms and admiring the beautifully-curated collections of amber, ivory, silver, gilt, jewels and bronzes.

Even if historical treasures aren‚Äôt your thing, the vault itself deserves some attention, having been painstakingly restored and rebuilt following the widespread destruction of 1945.

You can purchase tickets to the Green Vault from the main ticket desk at the castle. Entry to the Green Vault is on an allocated time slot basis but there is no limit on how long you can spend admiring the artefacts once admitted. The free audio guide is excellent, whether you are looking for a brief overview or an in-depth narrative on pieces of key significance.","Written December 31, 2018"

But for that price with zero student tarif (in contrast to the other museums run by the same organisation)?

An overzealous policy on jackets and bags enforced by fierce and unsympathetic staff?

Really irritating barrier system to access toilets which is a) inconvenient as loads of people don't take their ticket down and have to do the stairs 3 times and b) doesn't even function properly anyway?

It felt like I was going through an airport shopping mall with luxury items, not a museum open for the public good. August der Starke would not be impressed with what his museum has become.","Written December 26, 2018"

Germany,Green Vault,Awful,"Not only is this extremely expensive, but the overvealously miserable staff wouldn't allow my 78 year old mother to wear her jacket in the exhibition, despite the fact that she was cold and unwell.

Be aware that your entrance fee does not include the use of the cloakroom - which, by the way, is compulsory. There are lockers available, but bad luck if you don't happen to have 1 euro coins on your person

One thing they don't say is that there is absolutely zero information whatsoever about the objects on display. I mean literally zero. We didn't take audio guides because we prefer to read rather than walk around with a device. Which meant that we had no idea what we were looking at. And of course they wouldn't let us back out to get a guide.

In November, 2018, we visited both the ""Historic"" and the ""Neues"" Green Vaults.

The Neues Green Vault is far, far better than the Historic Green Vault. The Historic Green Vault has the Amber Room (Nowhere near as impressive as the Amber Room in Catherine's Palace in St Petersburg, Russia, which we visited 2 years ago). It has the two Moors holding trays of precious stones. Outside of that it has nothing to measure up to the quality--and quantity--of eye-popping items in the Neues Green Vault.

It is kind of ridiculous to have to make advance reservations for the Historic Green Vault and photos are absolutely forbidden--they are quite strict and will hammer you if you pull out a camera. I usually get away with a few dozen photos in these places but I didn't even pull my camera out in the Historic Green Vault.

On the other hand, almost all the really amazing stuff has been moved into the Neues Green Vault and you can take all the photos you'd like.

We are museum hounds and took about 700 photos each in the Neues Green Vault. If we were able to take photos in the Historic Green Vault we probably would have 80 - 100
photos and of lesser quality.

If you are short on time, skip the historic and go to the New Green Vault. I'd give the Historic Green Vault 2 or three stars and the New Green Vault a full 5 stars or more if the website would allow it.","Written November 4, 2018"

Germany,Green Vault,Unimaginable works of art,"Green Vault (Gr√ºnes Gew√∂lbe) is Europe's oldest Museum after the Vatican and has Europe's largest treasure collection. It owes its name to the malachite-green colour with which some column bases and their capitals were painted during extension works to the original building in 1547. The Museum was founded in 1723 by Augustus the Strong, patron of the arts and architecture. He called famous artists from Europe in his court and created a great collection of treasures, making the capital Dresden, a famous cultural city.
It's located in the Dresden Castle or Royal Palace (Dresdner Residenzschloss) on 2 floors of the Western part. After the damages of WWII, when 3 rooms were totally destroyed, Green Vault was restored.
The Historic Green Vault consists of 9 rooms and one entrance chamber and displays 3000 jewelry masterpieces. Among the highlights is the ""Moor with Emerald Cluster"", a 63.8 cm statue with emerald cluster, studded with 16 dark green emeralds.
The New Green Vault consists of 12 rooms. One of the most valuable exhibits is definitely the 41-carat (8.2 g) Dresden Green Diamond, the largest and finest natural green diamond in the world and then ""The Royal Household at Delhi on the Occasion of the Birthday of the Grand Mogul Aureng-Zeb"" the cost of which was more than the construction of the Moritzburg Castle itself!",

Germany,Green Vault,Amazing exhibit of treasures,"A place to show the collected riches of Augustus the Strong, the Gr√ºnes Gew√∂lbe (green vault) is an amazing place to visit while in Dresden. Each room is more amazing than the last with sculptures, rich jewels, collected artifacts, and more. It is too difficult to describe so just go see it, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.",
Germany,Green Vault,August the Strong and others who collected stuff,"This is a museum of stuff. It is as much the curiousity of seeing what was valued, like carvings on cherry pits, to seeing the items of immense intrinsic value, like the green diamond. Expect to spend quite a bit of time here.",
Germany,Green Vault,Amazing and unique,"We pre-booked historic green vault tickets on line; you can also purchase on site for specific entry times. We also combined with the ticket for the other museum exhibits at the royal palace including the new green vault. The historic green vault is amazing in terms of history, items on display, and the design of the spaces. The new green vault has wonderful treasures displayed in a modern setting. I would definitely do both..the grandeur of the historic vault is just as interesting as the amazing objects, particularly the use of mirrors and the organization of the objects. The included audio guide for the historic vault (there is no signage) was informative.","Written August 21, 2018"
Germany,Green Vault,Amazing collection,"The Green Vault is split between the historic part and the new Green Vault. There's a limited tickets each day to the historic part which you can pre-book online.
Both parts of the museum are amazing.
The historic part is nothing like what I've seen before, the collection inside are so rich and matches with the room. Although it's called the historic part but due to the war it's nearly all been destroyed but was rebuilt. There's headset with different languages so you can understand more about all the displays.
The new part of the museum also has heaps of displays.
Definitely worthwhile to spend some time visiting this museum.",

We were going to see the Turkish exhibit (on same ticket) but we spent so much time in ""Green Diamond"" section we didn't have time and more importantly what we saw in ""Green Diamond"" section was so overwhelming in beauty we were all exhausted.

Germany,Green Vault,Both Historic and New Green Vaults must be seen to be believed,"Located in the Royal Palace, the two Green Vaults, The Historic and The New, house a fabulous collection of objects d'art that are beautifully displayed. The Historic Green Vault displays the more than 2,500 piece collection of August the Strong. You move through a sumptuous baroque interior with priceless gold, ivory, amber, bronze and gemstone objects. Because the the works of art are free standing, not behind glass, visitors must check all coats and bags and pass through a double door security system. The number of visitors is limited each hour. The hall of Precious Object, a mirror lined space at the end of the tour is spectacular. No photos are allowed in the Historic Vault.
The New Green Vault with ten rooms, displays more than 1000 priceless objects from three centuries. There is an excellent audio guide to accompany the tour. Photos are allowed in this vault where the Saxony Crown Jewels, including the world's largest green emerald of 41 carat weight, are displayed. The gem encrusted model of the Great Mogul Aureng-Zeb Court at Delhi from 1708 is truly amazing.

This site is a good reminder of the powerful position Dresden once held as the capital of Saxony. Impressive!",

The Green Vault is divided into an old and new [parts, with different tickets. While it costs, I think both of them are a must visit.","Written July 15, 2018"
Germany,Green Vault,As Impressive as They Say,"This is a hot ticket in Dresden and it pays to book ahead. I got in at the start of its operating hours and saw long lines at the ticket office. Fortunately I had booked ahead, in fact I opted for the VIP ticket - 30 Euros and instead of waiting for the required timed entry I could walk right in. It also gave me access to all (I think 14) museums run by the palace. NO photos allowed, so I have none to share, but it is a dazzler, featuring amazingly detailed works and a very wide variety of them.
The old green vault is on the ground level, and the new green vault one floor up. That too is worth it, perhaps even more dazzling than the old. My pass allowed me to see that as well, and also the wonderful Gemaldegalerie, which I will review separately. Only those not even slightly interested in fine art and applied art (and fine applied art) will want to give this a miss during their time in Dresden.","Written July 11, 2018"
Germany,Green Vault,New Green Vault has an overwhelming collection of unique art objects from 1600 -1700s,"Viking Elbe River Cruise takes guests into the New Green Vault located in the Residezschloss, but if you want to see the Historic Green Vault, you must do so during your free time. There is a separate fee for the Historic Green Vault and a visiting time is given; belongings must be stored in the museum's locker room. The entrance for both these museums as well as the other ""minor"" collections is off Taschenberg strasse, kiddie corner from the Bell Tower in the Zwinger complex. The Historic Green vault is on the ground floor while the New Green Vault is one floor up - on the first floor.

Our personalized tour of the New Green Vault took 1 hour. All of the items on display have bilingual signage so even though free audioguides are available, they may not be needed. In the New Green Vault, our tour guide provided commentary and pointed out the objects we should not miss. The objects are displayed in plexiglass cases in a number of A/C modern rooms. Nothing stunning about these rooms - the emphasis is on the object in the display case. Most of the objects had their own display case with many of them in a room. The plexiglass casing allows full view of all sides of the object. There was no explanation for the name of this room as nothing in it was green.

Some of the objects were gifts by the Elector to his wife as Christmas presents while others were commissioned by the Elector from the court jeweler. Just a few seemed to be gifts from nobles. Most of the items seemed to to be dated from the late 1500's to early 1700's. I saw prices given for a few objects; the large numbers indicated ""pricey"" to me, but it was difficult to convert thalers into Euros.

The collection in the New Green Vault was begun by Augustus the Strong in the early 1700's. To me it was a unique collection of curiosities. For example, a cherry pit was carved with 185 images and attached as a pendant in a necklace. Visitors could see those images with a strong magnifying glass attached over the cherry pit. Another fine example, was a beautiful ivory frigate with translucent sails displaying the Saxon coat of arms, complete with miniscule ivory carved sailors climbing the rigging. A whimsical gilt dragon jug featured 3 snail shells to round out its body. There were other objects made from nautilus shells too. Gilt table clocks were popular as collector items. A really tall clock was decorated with precious stones and symbolic figurines. Table top chests were popular too for storage. Some had silver trim; others were inlaid with wood. I saw one that had just the tiniest painting of a medieval city in flames during a battle on one of its panels. Odd shaped pearls were fashioned into figurines of grotesque dwarves. More practical was a beautiful gold tea stand which held the most colorful porcelain tea cups and saucers. However, there were some real show stoppers. For one, the exquisitely detailed diorama of a Grand Mogul and his court in which he receives rich gifts from his princes was ever so subtlety studded with precious stones and diamonds.The other is the green diamond - surrounded by many small diamonds mounted onto a brooch. I was surprised that the green diamond was small after all the ravings I had heard about it. These more treasured items seemed to be placed at the end of the tour.

Our visit lasted one hour and I had had enough of viewing that type of collection. I recommend taking a break between a visit to this museum and the historic Green Vault. Visit other surrounding attractions or have lunch in the surrounding cafes. Then return to see the Historic Green Vault and perhaps some of the different collections housed in the Residenzschloss like the Turkish Kammer and Rustkammer.","Written July 9, 2018"

You cannot carry anything at all into the Historic Green Vault but there are lockers outside. We spent an hour or more in this first vault, which is a series of rooms displaying the treasures collected by the elector Augustus the Strong.

Germany,Green Vault,Unusual and Mesmerising,"First a warning. There are two Green Vaults. The Historic is not only separate from the New in terms of position but also has a different entry policy. There is one ticket for the Historic which has to be purchased on an individual basis and does not include the New. Also there is on a timed entry basis in order to look prevent crowding inside the Historic Green Vault. The New Green Vault entry price also includes entry to the other museums within the Residenzschloss or Royal Palace.

The Historic has an excellent audio guide. Indeed without it one is likely to be least as there are no labels of any type in any language. Entering the rooms one has to pass through double automatic doors. This regulates temperature and enhances security. It should be noted that as a result no bags (of any size), coats etc as the exhibits are open to damage by careless handling of such items.

Set out broadly as it was in the eighteenth century there are ten rooms categorised by the type of exhibit. As a result there are amber, Ivory, silver, silver gilt, bronze, jewellery etc . One exhibit which always garners attention is the Moor (actually a Native American from Florida). Holding a tray with uncut emerald. There is also an obelisk designed for the King which we found hideous.

This is a highly unusual museum which provides an insight into the way that the Kings of Saxony collected and displayed their treasures.

Immediately above is the New Green Vault. It should be noted that the place to get an audio guide for this and the other parts of the museum is located in a different place at the foot of the English Staircase.

The New has the Green Diamond the brilliance of which is diminished by its setting.again there are many rooms and exhibits as some are small but fascinating it is necessary to devote considerable time.

Overall the two Vaults combined required at least two an a half hours to pore over to gain sufficient insight into the period.","Written March 1, 2018"

I find the combination of technical prowess, artistry, the details involved in the exhibits are astounding. I found the clock room amazing. The scene from Indian Emperor Akbar's court is breathtaking when you examine all the details, particularly since was created based on conversations with traders who described the scenes of the Orient. A must see while in Dresden.","Written January 29, 2018"
Germany,Green Vault,Must see in Dresden!,We toured the Historic Green Vault in Dresden. The number of visitors is controlled and requires purchase of tickets in advance. I planned this months before our trip and thought it was well worth the effort. While viewing the treasures my spouse accidentally set off the alarms (twice!) but all handled well by staff! Whew! Our visit was actually 2016,"Written January 28, 2018"
Germany,Green Vault,Stunning,"Stunning exhibit showcasing the treasures of Saxony's royal family in recreated rooms. The equivalent of the UK's Crown Jewels.
We paid ‚Ç¨12 just for the historic green vault and weren't disappointed. The audio guide is a must and took about 90 minutes in all.","Written January 15, 2018"
Germany,Green Vault,Interesting but the rest of palace is better,"When you go to the palace you can get a ticket for just the palace 12euro or a combination ticket for palace and green vault which is 21 euro per person.

If you are conscious of your budget or short of time I would recommend skipping the green room. While it is interesting and offers a chapter of history for the area I didn't find it to be worth the cost and the rest of the palace has some far more interesting and extensive collections.

It is important to note that because of the bombing in 1945 a significant portion of the green vault associated rooms were destroyed by fire and have thus been recreated this century.","Written December 25, 2017"
Germany,Green Vault,Beautiful objects from 'old Dresden',"Even though this museum holds a huge collection of beautiful objects, it was not too overwhelming. Because it is well organised and laid out, I had a wonderful visit and learned a lot about old Dresden.

The vault is open on Mondays, unlike most museums in the Old Town - this fact is hardly noted anywhere; I wish I'd known that and planned my visit for Monday, when nothing else was open.

The treasures on display in both vaults are truly spectacular. The Historic Green Vault
has been restored to its original splendor, with the walls and structure of the rooms resembling its original state. The rooms and its displays are truly ornate. No photos are allowed here. Go through each room (guards monitor the number of guests allowed into each room) and listen to the audio guide to get a sense of what is being shown. There are separate rooms for works in ivory, in amber, and different precious materials. The jewel room is truly splendid. Don't miss the Dresden Green Diamond, the largest green diamond ever found. It is shown in a different room and is easy to miss.

The New Green Vault has more modern setting but the treasures on display are no less spectacular.

Germany,Green Vault,One of the major reasons to visit Dresden,"Augustus the Strong had quite a little trinket collection. This ensemble contains some of the most amazing jewels and sculpture I have ever viewed. The rooms are entered through an airlock and each room contains a different element such as gold, white silver, amber, etc. It takes about 60 Minutes to adequately view the historical green vault. There is an additional green vault, the new green vault, which contains more treasures. I recommend touring both for the best experience.

The green Vault are located inside the Residenzschloss. There are many other collections at this site including the Turkish room, the coin room and others. The facility also contains a very nice gift shop and a small cafe. This facility is not to be missed on any visit to Dresden. I personally found the city enchanting and plan to return to see the things that I did not have time to see.

Please note: photographs are not allowed inside the Green Vault but the bookstore contains many books which have pictures of the treasures.","Written November 6, 2017"
Germany,Green Vault,Most enjoyable feature in Dresden,"We purchased the timed ticket to the Historic Green Vault and spent nearly 3 hours there. What a wonderful collection - almost reliving history again. I strongly recommend to visit it, because the audio guide leads the listener very systematically through the various rooms.

The way it's been reconstructed after having been nearly completely destroyed by the bombs, and the collection of treasures it holds, is simply impressive.

The Ottoman collection was interesting too. It was totally worth spending my day there. When I reached there at 9.40am, there was already a long line to buy tickets to the Historical vault. I visited the cafe for some refreshments before resuming my visit. The sour cream orange cake was delicious.","Written August 23, 2017"

Germany,Green Vault,"Amazing collection, excellent museum","The Green Vault holds an incredible collection of jewels and art objects collected by the princes of Saxony over the centuries. The museum is extremely well organized. You can leave any valuables, bags etc in lockers at the entrance. I recommend getting an audio tour (it's free), as the recorded explanations are well worth it. The collection includes ivory, silver, gold, glass and precious stones. It's simply astounding.

We visited the old vault, which reproduces the old rooms in the Saxons' palace. The old palace was heavily damaged during the bombing of Dresden in WWII, but it has been lovingly and meticulously restored over several decades. The museum includes photos and detailed descriptions of the restoration process.

The ticket also includes access to the Turkish room, which exhibits very beautiful tents, armors, swords and other weapons. The princes of Saxony had repeated interactions with the Ottoman Empire, and the objects displayed here reflect that history.

As I said, the museum is extremely well organized. I recommend bringing a sweater (as the rooms are climate controlled), leaving your bags in the lockers at the entrance, and getting the audio tour.","Written August 18, 2017"

Germany,Green Vault,Mesmerising Collection of Objets.,"The Green Vaults must be one of the top must-do visits for lovers of Schmuck, objets, jewels, and just heaps of exotic 'stuff'. I absolutely loved this visit. Ivories, jewels, bizarre drinking vessels, a table sized panorama in precious metal and enamel of a festival at the court of the Mogul Emperor. It's all there. Really enjoyable. Entry tickets are timed so although the wait wasn't long, it pays to be aware and not miss your slot to go through the bank vault style security doors.

Germany,Green Vault,THE BEST Treasury in Europe!,"OH, MY GOSH!!! Words still fail us in trying to adequately describe the treasures here. Rooms full of gold, silver, diamonds, precious jewels, scepters, on and on and on and on. First, the place has the tightest security of any museum/attraction/site we've been to in Europe - and we've been to a lot. Absolutely no purses, bags, backpacks, and for sure no cameras. Don't even try it. One man behind us tried to go in with his camera and security was there i-m-m-e-d-i-a-t-e-l-y. You even have to have your ticket to scan the code in order to go to the bathroom here. After visiting, you'll see why all of this is so, so important. We had audio guides, which we finally ditched because we just wanted to drink it all in visually. 5 Stars is not enough. Would go back in a heartbeat.","Written August 6, 2017"
Germany,Green Vault,Not worth a visit,"- rude staff, treating visitors more like thieves
- scheduled 15 minute long entrance time
- need audioguides, and need to leave ID/passport, no description in the exhibition
- not allowed to take even jackets inside
- too cool air conditioning
- objects too far away, too high
- annoying alarm systems that goes off when someone is approx. 30 cm from the items (which are mostly behind glas)
- expensive (12 ‚Ç¨), no student discount if you are over 16

I've been to plenty museums right now and never had been treated so disrespectful.
First a friend of mine asked a man at the information point what exactly is at the exhibition and he answered ""a room"" as she repeated the question the answer was still the same. We were all German native speakers. As she came back and told about it I just said ""sometimes the people in saxony just have an strange accent that may sound rude"" little did I know...

When buying the tickets we were somehow ""lucky"" you need to buy a ticket for a time span, probably so the exhibition isn't overcrowded, sounds legit to me, but our waiting time was only half an hour. Yet the cashier was already rude to us and apparent there are no student discounts. OK it was summer and hot, so maybe you can get exhausted we thought, but the fun just begun...

We went to the cloakroom, stored our backpacks, I leaved my jacket on as one the inside the air conditioning was working a little bit too good...Took my photocamera with me, as I simply don't like to leave it alone and we went to the exhibition.

On the front was someone giving the audioguides and I went to ask if the cost extra ""no, but you have to leave your ID"" was the answer and ""you have to leave your bag in the cloakroom"" already with a shill almost panicking voice. ""It's only my camera"" i answered and than she said ""taking pictures is prohibited"" and I said ""ok so i won't take any pictures"" and her imidiate answer was ""go and discuss at the entrance""... so off we went without the audioguides.

The first room showed some objects to shorten the waiting time for the chamber, and it was written beneath the objects what they were.

Our time had come and we went to the real entrance. The woman there was somehow nicer. She said that I cannot take the camera with me no way but in the cloakrooms are also lockers only reachable by the staff so I said OK and went back. Luckily they did not said anything about the jackets anymore or we would have frozen to death.

The entrance is a little science fiction like, nothing new sadly, but you have to go into a gate for maximum two persons.
We were laughing as you do when you are somewhere with friends. We two of us were going inside the woman asked the other friend ""why are you laughing? Does she has the camera underneath her jacket?"" Which was a really strange and bad accusation.

In the exhibition were no written information, so without the audioguides we got none...

There was a woman who took a picture with her mobile (there were nowhere visible ""no photos"" signs, and while not taking pictures is something I can respect and understand, as the museums like the people to come instead of seeing everything online in our age it seems too outdated, beside this they can ask you to not publish them which most people will do) and the quads asked her to show her mobile to prove she deleted it! Something that is as far as I know forbidden.

It is also difficult to see most of the objects as they are too far away and mostly too high. Beside this there is an annoying alarm system that always rang when someone came too close to the objects (approx. 30cm). One guard even pushed a visitor away.

When going out I heard one guard saying through his communication system ""yes, she is finally leaving"" unbelievable... about whom it was, when not us?

And this amazing trip costs 12 ‚Ç¨ and lasts around 30min...

They treated us like potential thieves, we wondered if they just don't want visitors to come or doing a white strike or just are terribly unfriendly","Written July 27, 2017"
Germany,Green Vault,So much to take in!,"I was traveling with my two college-aged children, and we were in Dresden on a Monday. Basically all museums are closed in Dresden on Monday, except for the historic Green Vault, so that made the decision which museum to visit easy. When we first arrived in Dresden we didn't know where to go - we easily found the opera hall and other landmarks, but we couldn't find the entrance to the Green Vault. We even asked other people on the street and no one knew! We finally stumbled on to the entrance and made our way in.

We arrived around noon that day, and there was absolutely no one in line. We purchased our tickets at the desk and our time for entry was just a 10 minute wait. There is a small gallery that you can walk around and look if you want, or just have a seat on one of the benches inside. There is an audio guide which you should absolutely take with you. When it is your time, you go two by two through a set of doors, then you stand there in front of a second set of doors until the first are completely closed, then they open the second set. It was a little like some sci-fi movie so to be honest we did have a little giggle about it. Once inside you go from opulent room to opulent room - and the rooms generally have a theme. One room was filled with ivory pieces, others with crystal, etc. There are hundreds of items in each room; it is a bit overwhelming. The audio guide helps you to hone in on some of the more important pieces, but some of the explanations tended to be pretty long winded. My favorite was one of the final rooms with all the jewels - jeweled buttons, sword hilts,all sorts of things! Made you wish you could have seen some of these people ""in the day"" wearing all these items.

To leave the exhibit you have to go through the airlock procedure again. This museum is a little pricey, and probably would not be interesting to younger teens or smaller. But we were glad to do it, and then were off to enjoy the rest of Dresden.","Written July 26, 2017"
Germany,Green Vault,Absolutely stunning and amazing and spectacular!!,"If you miss this museum you will be sorry for the rest of your life. I have been to palaces in France, Russia, Morocco, etc. Have never seen treasures that even come anywhere close to the collection in the New Green Museum. Well worth the 12 Euro entry fee. Be sure to go to the top of the tower before you leave the museum! The 360 degree views are outstanding and it is included in the price of your ticket.","Written July 10, 2017"
Germany,Green Vault,Beautiful collection,"The collection of treasures is amazing, even more so when you consider when it was started, and what has survived the wars.

The exceptionally beautiful jewelry is in the historical part of the Green Vault. It is exciting to see gigantic diamonds and other stones used in that time.

Germany,Palmengarten,An unusually great selection of plants,"We were really impressed with the great selection of plants present. It is obvious a meticolous job has been done to gather and caretake all these botanical delights. Some parts of the park like the Rubus section is very well organized with every species being separated from the rest. Other sections like the East Asian section where everything grows wildy together. Beautifully executed and without a clear overall plan.
We were shocked to find the poisionous plants being gathered together in a ""poison sector"" where highly dangerous plants were free to touch by children and adults alike, without much warning signs present or barriers to prevent touching or tasting. Some of them deadly poisionus and others delirical and hallucination-inducing. Everything also next to several bees nests where thousands of bees were roaming around the area. This feels a bit unsafe and careless, but exciting nonetheless.
There is also a large meat-eating section where the plants, however with some marking errors (some confusion between Dionaea vs. Nepenthes)

We must again stress the amazing selection - this surpasses most botanical gardens we have ever seen before. A day or two can easily be spent here.","Written August 14, 2021"

There are always special events and exhibitions all year round. The orchid exchange and the winter lights are two of many worthwhile events. The dates can be found on the homepage. I recommend the homepage, sometimes glass houses are closed due to renovations.

The Gardens - nice garden serving up some wonderful flowers wherever you look, indoor tropical paradise is amazing (see pictures), the location has an indoor newsagent shop and a coffee shop. Bit pricey but ok. There is a land train that circles the garden every 30 minutes from the entrance, playground for the children is spacious and can keep them occupied for hours, nice lake with a boat ride facility ‚Ç¨8 for 2 adults 2 children - has an amazing water fountain too.

My recommendation is you allow 4 to 5 hours to view the place. There was 20 adults and 8 children when we visited. (Children ‚Ç¨2 each, adults ‚Ç¨7 each)

Germany,Palmengarten,peaceful walk in the park,I was only in Frankfurt for a day so this was a nice way to break up the running around with a calm stroll through the beautiful gardens. Plenty of great places to sit and enjoy nature.,"Written August 25, 2019"
Germany,Palmengarten,Nice relaxing stroll,"Another time I wished for a 'good' option in here.

Nice park, well spread out and decent assortment of trees, shrubs, plants etc.

Few indoor exhibits, greenhouses, palms etc.

Lake in the middle, few smaller ponds around and great value for money.

These places are hard to review, I enjoyed it but when I compare it to others it's not a stand out experience.

Main path and greenhouses are wheelchair friendly and there were only a few places not accessible.",

Germany,Palmengarten,Garden and sunshine ramble,"I enjoyed wandering through the gardens and the greenhouse in the sunny weather. Easy enough to find when I jumped off the blue line hop on hop off tour. Entrance fee was ‚Ç¨6 and you are given a map to navigate the 20 hectares. You can wander amongst special exhibitions, the rose garden, rock gardens, villas and even enjoy a row on the lake. Stopped in for a cool drink at the cafe and the service and prices were reasonable. They also had a tram/train that looks to run in the summer months and the cost was ‚Ç¨1.50. I just missed it and decided not to wait, but looked like fun. There was even a water play area where the kids were having fun keeping cool. Totally enjoyable way to spend a few hours.","Written August 17, 2019"

Germany,Palmengarten,"More than a ""Botanical Garden""!","These gardens have many various, beautiful ""elements""! the Gardens cover about 22 Hectares, (or 49 acres). They were built, and open to the Public about 148 years ago! Located nearby is another Botanical garden-- which is now ""managed/administered"" by the ""Palm Garden"". The various interesting displays are located in greenhouses or outside... and, on a sunny day, they are at their best! There is also a small lake with ""paddle boats""... as well as a small train (which amuses children of all ages.

Germany,Palmengarten,"Good, but also a lot of wasted space","Open daily at 09h00 the Frankfurt Botanical Garden (Palmengarten) covers a lot of space in Westend-S√ºd, but between areas under construction and too many open areas in between the various buildings it feels as though better curation is necessary to compete with truly world class collections. Certainly interesting for its take on the tropics and desert, particularly for those who may not have visited either climate, May 2019's Citrus exhibit was largely a waste.",
Germany,Palmengarten,Beautiful place,"The price is 10‚Ç¨, one time entrance. Better to take water bottles, and snacks. there are few shops, but not much of a choice. There is a place to relax on the grass, take a tram for 1.2‚Ç¨ or smth like this one way.",

The many different exhibits and pavilions were full of exotic and exceptional plants. Good walkways led us through each one. There was some information in English but many of the important signs did not, so I was not as well I formed as I would have liked to have been.
Areas for children to play and a little railway were enhancements for a family day out. Food was set up in many areas as were picnic tables, chairs and areas to sit back and relax ... wonderful surprises.

The weather was really agreeable for our visit (autumn sunshine, quite warm) and first thing in the morning, so it was quiet and idyllic to be in this little oasis in the middle of the bustle of the giant city outside. Our guide was very knowledgeable and gave great attention to the questions of my 10-year-old son (who has a fascination for palms - hence the visit). The main palm house was really amazing, both from a botanical collection and architectural/aesthetic perspective - really nice water features, not too humid, and well signed in German and English (mostly).

After the guided tour we spent another hour wandering round the outside gardens. Not a huge amount of outdoor plants compared with the greenhouses, but still a lovely place to walk and enjoy the garden. We were a little too early for lunch but the restaurant menu looked good with an express option for busy visitors.","Written October 17, 2018"

Germany,Palmengarten,Rosen- und Lichterfest / Winterlichter,"Palmengarten is always worth to visit. Highlight in summer: Rosen- und Lichterfest: Walk around the park among roses and other beautiful flowers, bring your piquenique (or buy food and drinks at reasonable prices) and do not forget to take candles with you so that you can enjoy the illumination of thousands of candles. In case you like to dance: There is different kind of music. This event takes place for 3 days. My favorite event in summer lasts for several weeks. I prefer to visit the greenhouses and spectacular light performances around christmas time.","Written November 8, 2017"

Germany,Palmengarten,"Ok playground, clean toilets but expensive admission","We bought a year card and I still feel it is expensive to have a ok playground and clean toilets.

In our case there is no interest in the botanical part so that doesn't provide much value so if you do like botanical stuff you might find this fantastic.

Anyway they have a small electrical train driving from one end to another during summer time. You need to pay additional to ride that and our kid loves the train ride so in the end we have spent over 100 euro quickly over a year.","Written October 21, 2017"
Germany,Palmengarten,Wonderful place to visit and relax,"I visited this place on a Sunday afternoon. Entrance fee was I believe ‚Ç¨7.50 although it seemed following my tour that entry was still possible without payment of said fee. Cannot be sure though and I paid.
They have a few different places to visit, such as a place with a bit of a tropical rainforest sort of set-up, and one with a bit of a desert-theme. Given the time of the year, it made me think that a visit in the heart of summer would have been even better. They had a decent looking rose garden where a lovely lady in a white wedding dress was having some pictures taken, although the session was disturbed by the onset of a brief rainy spout that lasted but a minute.
The exhibits around a really nice, although it would have only been even better (or rather simpler for those who cannot understand German) if the signs had a translation. But oh well for now they insist on one having to learn German to fully appreciate the guided notes, and that would be a wonderful bonus once you learn it.
By the booth where I paid the ticket, there is a nice water feature as well which involves a big stone ball spinning by the force of water alone. From what I was told, the spinning rock ball weighs 1.8tonnes and one can actually push it to force it to move in other directions.
There is also a nice little waterfall feature and a little lake where one can relax in the park.
I would definitely recommend this place as a nice chill out location, especially if entrance can be gained freely.",

Germany,Sanssouci Park,A must-see,"tourists time you can be on your own, because of the circuitousness of the park. It's very huge, so you can find a new and different way to walk around there everytime and never get bored. Besides the amazing work of the gardeners in the park, which is very beautiful independent of the time of the year, you can discover a few buildings, like the chinese teahouse or the roman bath. On top of that, you can visit the Castle of Sanssouci with all the stairs and plants around, it makes a stunning look and it's definitly a must-see at your visit in Potsdam.
Moreover, the park offers the best place to do sport outside. Next to the many ways, which are appropriate for jogging, The stairs close to the Castle of Sanssouci or the Orangerie are also perfect for some endurance train. After that you can visit a very nice and tiny caf√© near the mill.
The only problem is that there a not so many toilets around, so I substract one point.","Written December 3, 2020"

There are several places to sit and eat too. Also inside the park there are separate beautiful gardens and even an orangery(though, in my opinion, the entrance is expensive).
...
So what about the mentioned earlier disadvantage? ...For all these events and attractions that you can visit, tickets can be bought at the box office located in the house next to the mill that is next to the parking. There are tickets for all occasions (for one, and for a family, and for any other situations). So, we bought a ticket to all places in the park ... but! ... we were told that some places will be closed today, both outside and inside the park, because of the different days of work. In other words, part of the attractions work on one day, and part on the other, but that expensive ticket that you buy for that particular day to all places at once.

We were there with 2 teenagers and gave them the freedom to walk around themselves visiting the stuff they liked the most. The only problem is the stupid rule that you need to buy a separate photo permit. The staff is very rude in reminding you to this and typically they refuse to speak English.

Definitely worth having the wheels, though.
There's nowhere to fill up water bottles (tap and fountain water isn't potable) so be prepared to pay for a refreshment or bring extra.
Be aware that it's a tourist destination and while the palaces are open for tours, the gardens surrounding them are quite busy.

Germany,Sanssouci Park,Impressive Gardens On A Grand Scale.,"We were at Sanssouci mainly to see the Palace, but we also enjoyed the substantial gardens that surround the main buildings and are an attraction in their own right. Beautifully maintained, we could quite understand the many simply strolling and enjoying the views.",
Germany,Sanssouci Park,Sanssouci Park and Palace in Potsdam ‚Äì is a lovely place to visit.,"Sanssouci Park and Palace in Potsdam ‚Äì is a lovely place to visit. Palaces, terraced grounds, majestic fountains, and the swan lake - I enjoyed everything very much there. The fantastic garden design unites with works of most famous architects and sculptors of their times. Look into details; you will find in every sculpture something amazing such as two Greek Sphinxes at the entrance to the World Heritage Park of Sanssouci covered by transparent organza from stone. Spring and Fall are the best time to visit. It is 17 min to go by fast train from the centre of Berlin, one day ticket (Tageskarte Berlin ABC) coasts 7,7 EUR. It is free entrance to Park, but to see Palaces inside costs from 6-10 EUR. It takes one day to Park. There are nice restaurants in Luisen Platz close to the main entrance.","Written June 5, 2019"
Germany,Sanssouci Park,Half day walk,"One of my favorite place if I am in Berlin.
Great destination for half day trip.
You can park your car in the parking area (I think 2 hours for ‚Ç¨5).
You might want to buy tickets to different palaces, but entry to the park is for free.
Good idea is to make a bike ride from Berlin or in the park.",
Germany,Sanssouci Park,Beautiful park,These grounds are enormous and an integral part of the palace grounds. Take a leisurely tour or stay all day.,"Written May 19, 2019"
Germany,Sanssouci Park,Beautiful park,"Beautiful park, especially around spring time. Even if you do not visit the palaces, it is definitely worth walking around the park and enjoying nature and some beautiful sights. Or just go there with a book and enjoy some peace and quiet in a beautiful place.","Written May 9, 2019"
Germany,Sanssouci Park,Amazing park,This is an amazing park to walk though and visit the numerous Palaces and other old buildings. Allow yourself plenty of time to fully appreciate everything it has to offer.,
Germany,Sanssouci Park,One of best places in Germany,"Sanssouci Park and Palaces are Jewel in the crown of Prussian Germany. As a local of Potsdam i would suggest tourists to take Bus no 605, 606 or 695 from main train station and get off at Campus Neuen Palais (new palace). Take a walk from new palace toward the Sanssouci. You will get an opportunity to get the overview of park and other magnificent attractions like Dongerie..","Written May 8, 2019"
Germany,Sanssouci Park,Take a stroll in the history of Potsdam,One of the best places to visit in Potsdam since it consists of several.palaces and royal buildings. The Chinese house is a highlight,"Written May 3, 2019"
Germany,Sanssouci Park,View is breathtaking!,"If you want to visit palaces this is the place to do it, there are so many of them. In fact impossible to visit all of them on the day pass, as they are spread out and you have to walk to them. Too bad they don't have some kind of navette to get around.","Written May 3, 2019"
Germany,Sanssouci Park,"Extensive area to walk, lots to see... but no places to rest","This is a very large park area which contains numerous attractions to see / visit.
One thing that this park lacks though are shaded areas and benches so you can rest while conducting your park exploration. As the park is large and extensive walking is needed, rest areas come at a premium.
There were no beverages vendors when we visited either (end of April), so bring your own water.
There are very few bathrooms available and they are paid ones, except for the one nearby the Chinese house and biergarten.","Written May 1, 2019"

Germany,Sanssouci Park,Lovely place to stroll,"The Palace grounds (the Park) were beautiful, serene and provided a lovely walk to be had. We walked up to the ruins where we took a breather and looked out to the views towards the Palace and Potsdam. Lovely grounds to have a picnic in like several groups we saw along our walk!","Written April 24, 2019"
Germany,Sanssouci Park,Stunning park,"I found this place to be very beautiful. The palace was very grand. The gardens and statues were stunning.

The whole place was so serene and it was very enjoyable to stroll in.

It is a huge area and it will take a few hours to see many of the interesting attractions in the compound.","Written April 12, 2019"
Germany,Sanssouci Park,Fantastic place,Really pretty park even in March so it must be amazing in the summer. Lost to see and so many interesting old buildings. You easily spend a few days here just soaking up the place. Can‚Äôt wait to come back in the summer.,"Written April 7, 2019"
Germany,Sanssouci Park,Even in the Cold ...,"It's beautiful even in the cold and rain. All of the statues are covered for protection from the elements but you can imagine the beauty when spring and summer are here. Ancient trees, you have to wonder how old. We found a ""greenhouse"" to get out of the cold - there is a cost, but it was worth it!","Written April 3, 2019"
Germany,Sanssouci Park,A beautiful place to go away from Berlin city centre,"After a few days in Berlin city centre my wife and I decided to go somewhere different. We caught s train to Potsdam, and after walking around that centre we found the park and walked along the long 2 mile walk down the mall towards the Palace. Even before all the plants are out and while the statues are still boxed up we could appreciate the beauty of the place.","Written March 31, 2019"
Germany,Sanssouci Park,Some issues with the visitor experience - but great palaces,"The palaces - Sanssouci and the New Palace are excellent to visit, even on a cold and wet spring day so they bring my score up to 4 but visitors should be aware of some shortcomings in the visitor experience overall. Firstly many of the historic buildings are 'put to bed' in the winter and do not open until May ( sensible from a conservation point of view given they have no heating ) - you will not get a discount for this fact. Also to visit the two main palaces you must go on a guided tour and have timed slots ( so when you arrive at the first palace you are well advised to book onto a timed slot for the second one later that day or you may not get to see it) . Groups around Sanssouci palace are small as many of the rooms are small - the tour here is by audio ( in your own language) with the guide merely opening and closing doors as you go, the tour here is about 30 -40 minutes. The audio is very informative - even if it is a tight squeeze in some rooms. For the New Palace it is a personal guide who gives the tour in German whilst non German speakers use the audio guide, this tour takes around an hour. Be aware that one palace is completely closed on Mondays, the other on Tuesdays. The downsides we found were lack of proper refreshment facilities ( we found a sit down lunch venue near the old mill - which we did not have time to use - given our timed visit slot in the next palace which is a 2km walk) At the New Palace Visitor centre there is a tiny cafe - really small - ridiculously so for the large numbers of people. I think there is another cafe which we never found as it is more isolated from the two main palaces. Perhaps there are food stands in the summer to cater for visiors - but not in March. Then toilet facilities at both visitor centres charge either 50c or one euro - which is pretty expensive especially as you have probably paid 19 euro for your palaces ticket ! They are also quite small so expect to queue. If you haven't taken a tour bus around Potsdam then there is a service bus service which leaves from close to the New Palace visitor centre which takes you back to town or the station ( if you have a Berlin ABC travel card this journey is free). So overall we found it a bit of a mixed experience....","Written March 17, 2019"
Germany,Sanssouci Park,Cold and windy but a real beauty,"The statues were all wrapped up in their winter cabins but like a beautiful lady we could appreciate the bone structure underneath.

Germany,Reichstag Building,"A ""must"" on any tour to Berlin.","A building of such importance and with so much history. A must visit on any trip to Berlin.

However in these times of Covid there is one very important message to give and that is book early. If you see an on-line ""Visiting slot"" take it and sort the logistics out later. We could only secure a visit at 9.00 am on a Sunday morning, but were so glad we didn't hesitate.

For those who cannot book a tour, consider having a meal in the restaurant and using that as an opportunity to enter the building. An added bonus are the unrestricted views from the top of the building.

Finally if you do manage to hit the jackpot and get to visit then take time to carefully read what documentation / pre-registration is required. When we went they were strictly enforcing the rules and I am sure people are turned away.","Written October 19, 2021"country_name,place_name,review_header,review,written_date
