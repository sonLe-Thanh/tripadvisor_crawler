Germany,Reichstag Building,"A ""must"" on any tour to Berlin.","A building of such importance and with so much history. A must visit on any trip to Berlin.

However in these times of Covid there is one very important message to give and that is book early. If you see an on-line ""Visiting slot"" take it and sort the logistics out later. We could only secure a visit at 9.00 am on a Sunday morning, but were so glad we didn't hesitate.

For those who cannot book a tour, consider having a meal in the restaurant and using that as an opportunity to enter the building. An added bonus are the unrestricted views from the top of the building.

Finally if you do manage to hit the jackpot and get to visit then take time to carefully read what documentation / pre-registration is required. When we went they were strictly enforcing the rules and I am sure people are turned away.","Written October 19, 2021"

It was simply stunning. There was tons to eat, felt healthy as well as tasty, plus a glass of fizz included in the higher priced breakfast - well worth it. Spent 2 hours here.

Germany,Reichstag Building,Unfulfilling,"The building the SS presumably set on fire to instigate stricter measures against their opponents. Built about 50 years before WWII it has seen a lot of change. If you enter it, you can visit the roof, which offers both a view of the city, and the ability to look over the politicians at work inside the building, through the added glass dome.

It offers the opportuinity to reflect on whether Europe is moving forwards or backwards, and whether the Germans, who keeps trying to strenghten Europe by pushing for democratic erosion through the EU, is this time doing the right thing. Personally I think we have a long way to go before we see true transparancy in Europe.","Written October 6, 2020"

Germany,Reichstag Building,Historic,Beautiful and incredibly historical building that‚Äôs still the seat of the German parliament. Access to the glass rotunda is free but needs to be booked in advance. Likewise tours can be booked if you want to see the inside (and some soviet soldiers graffiti). Very close to the Brandenburg Gate with easy transport links around Berlin,
Germany,Reichstag Building,An ideal home of an ideal nation!,"It's worthy of being treated as an example of how a Parliament building should be, and probably it's a depiction of what the German Nation stands for. It's classy, dignified, and understated; it's modern, but with its classical roots; it's grand, but not ostentatious. But more than anything, it states 3 very critical aspects, conveniently forgotten by other governments: 1. Provides access to the common man (it's our/their Govt. dammit) 2. Transparency, the dome is made of glass and so is the ceiling of the parliament floor for all to see 3. The citizen is physically placed higher than the parliamentarians, clearly stating how the power should flow.

No wonder, this nation is where it is, in merely 6 decades after being decimated. Kudos!",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Visit the Top,The rotonda of the Reichstags Building is Always worth a visit. The view is very nice and you have plenty of photo opportunities,
Germany,Reichstag Building,Well worth the top spot,I made the mistake on a previous trip to Berlin by not booking in advance and was turned away at the door. Having this time booked several weeks in advance we turned up for an evening tour. The views from the top of the dome (both internal and across the city) are well worth adding this to your itinerary.,
Germany,Reichstag Building,The Dome by night,"While in Berlin end of August, I decided to visit the Dome. In order to avoid the crowd, I opted for a night visit and I did not regret it. First of all, you have to pre-book online in order to make sure you can get in (you still have the option to buy ticket at the entrance but you may not be always successful so in order to avoid any disappointment, better reserve online). One important thing: do not forget your ID. I went around 8.30 pm and the view at night is spectacular. Furthermore, there were few people and I could take nice picture. The view from the terrace is breathtaking. Norman Foster did an amazing job. A beautiful building and a free visit!",

Germany,Reichstag Building,"Book ahead, as it doesn't always allow tours","Were could only see the outside of this amazing building. What great architecture, and amazing to see. Whilst it was rebuilt following the war is still has spender and gravitas.

You are able to go inside, if you book a tour, and go up the dome. It looks directly into the parliament itself and also I am advised there is somewhere to eat up the top.

Take the time to look ahead and book to get inside as we believe we have missed out, but failing that view the building from the outside to be astounded.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,The history of Berlin with an incredible outlook,"The building of the German Parliament has an interesting, rich history. You can book (do it in well advance!) a guided tour (obviously about the history of the building, how the parliament works, the occupation of the building in WW2) inside the building, or just visit the glass dome and enjoy the view of Berlin.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,A must see!,We loved visiting here - the 360 degrees view was incredible and the audio guide was fascinating. The queue also went down quite quickly. Definitely worth a visit.,"Written July 15, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Overlook Berlin from the glass dome,"Reichstag is a must see while visiting Berlin. Plan ahead to book your ticket online or plan to wait a long line to get tickets. The modern glass dome on the classic building is incredible beautiful. From both inside and outside of the dome, we can see the view of Berlin. The building houses the German Parliament. We can learn some history from photographs inside of the dome.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,An excellent view of Berlin!,"We visited the Reichstag on invitation of my cousin who lives in Berlin. You have to pre book your visit online and submit passport details of you are not a German citizen, no worries around this.

To enter, you must first make it through an airport style security hall. I had my grandmother in a wheelchair and they made it very accommodating for her. We were taken personally to the lift due to having to go through some security critical areas. Once there, we were loaded into the lift first before we picked up a lot more people in the floor above. The lift then takes you directly to the top dome.

The views were excellent and you receive a free audio guide to talk you through what you can see. There is a very long spiral walkway up to the top and the audio guide is designed to know where you are on that walkway, then giving you information about the building and the views beyond.

At the top there is a viewing platform where you can rest and view the sights. Then follow the other spiral walkway which takes you back down, again, the audio guide is giving you timely information.

Overall, this is a wonderful place to visit, i would even pay for the privilege, but the fact it was free made it even better!",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Book online in advance,THis is a must see while visiting Berlin. Don't forget to book your ticket online in advance or you may not be able to visit the building. The glass dome is incredible.,"Written April 27, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Can't believe it's free!,"Book in advance to secure your spot and you'll be grateful you did. The view of the city from the top is fantastic (we went 09:45 in early Feb and were lucky to have clear skies), and I love the fact that the public have a view down into the chambers.

Definitely use the free audio guide on offer (it comes in lots of languages) and take time to really look at the photos and information on display. My husband and I learnt a lot.","Written April 24, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Impressive Building,Even just to stand outside and admire the architecture is a good experience. The building survived the war but was not allowed to be used as a parliament building until after the Cold War ended.,
Germany,Reichstag Building,Worth doing,You should probably include the Bundestag when visiting Berlin for the grandeur of it's architecture for an hour or so,"Written April 20, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,"Book in advance, I guess!","We arrived in Berlin, and decided at the last minute to visit the Reichstag building. We had not booked in advance. I checked online and saw that there was ONE slot left! 9:45PM. We took it. When I checked back the next day I saw that the next possible visit was 2 weeks away, so do what we did at your own risk. Glad we got to go.

The building was interesting to visit as it has a lot of history, including its burning as the Nazis came to power. Great view from the top and the glass dome. You can also walk around their exhibit and see the history of the building.","Written April 9, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,"Beautiful, Must Visit",Important tip : Register for free in advance to visit the Dome of the Reichstag. I would recommend starting your trip to Berlin by a visit to the Reichstag first. Easy to get to by the metro. Spectacular views and information of history .,
Germany,Reichstag Building,"I found this to be one of the more surprising things to do in Berlin, and I‚Äôm sure you will too!","The Reichstag Building is the current home of the German Parliament, and as such, boasts a prime location on the banks of the River Spree. Over the years, it‚Äôs survived Nazi rule, wars, bombings, the country‚Äôs division and even a fire. In 1933, only four weeks after Hitler‚Äôs rise to power, the Reichstag Building was subject to a mysterious arson attack and almost destroyed by flames. Following the fire, the police conducted a search and accused a Dutch council communist of starting it. He was arrested, as were four communist leaders soon after. Hitler then urged the president to pass an emergency degree, which led to the mass arrests of the entire Communist Party of Germany and left the Nazi Party unchallenged. This enabled Hitler to consolidate his power.

The Reichstag Building‚Äôs present-day appeal, however, lies on its roof rather than its history. The large glass dome offers visitors a 360-degree view of the surrounding Berlin cityscape. Mirrors integrated in the dome reflect natural light and illuminate the parliamentary chamber below. From an architectural standpoint, it‚Äôs unique and seemingly futuristic. From a photography standpoint, it‚Äôs very visually pleasing and many of you will find different and creative ways of capturing it.

I visited during the day and found it breath-taking. I read online that after dark it‚Äôs even better! The dome is free to visit but an online registration needs to be filled out and submitted prior to your arrival.","Written April 1, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,A bucket list item done!,"There is so much information to absorb on a visit, you really need to have a guide, ours was excellent and easy going, there was the odd dumb question from the group but they were dealt with in a polite and courteous manner. Its an amazing building and experience, make sure to bring photo id or you won't get in!","Written April 1, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,"Don't come just for a photo, take a tour - but book well in advance","The Reichstag is a main edifice of the Bundestag - the German Parliament (the lower house) in the very city center, 5 min walk from the Brandenburg gate. It's a remarkable bldg with a significant history, so seeing only the exterior is far from enough for any serious traveller. Therefore, I recommend booking a tour of it.
And, I suggest doing that as soon as possible - beware, it fills up quickly.
The process is very easy on the Bundestag website, it's totally free and you can do that for 3 months in advance. There are several options to choose from, but I recommend a guided tour followed by the Dome visit.
Have in mind, you cannot either climb the Dome without prebooking and written confirmation (you can take your chance by queuing outside if they have spaces left, but why should you do that when you can arrange everything with no stress).
You book a date and a time slot (you have an option to name 3 of them that best suit you, and you'll be assigned one of them). You have to be there 30 min prior the assigned time WITH a PRINTED voucher (confirmation). Be prepared for airport style security.
The tour lasts around 90 min during which you must not leave your guide. It's very informative and interesting and you visit various parts of the Bundestag. Best part is naturally the Reichstag main debate room where the Parliament meets with the enormous eagle, designed by a Dutch architect. Beside that you're taken to other parts of Bundestag via underground hallways, like the part where're the member's offices across the library (which is the third largest in the world) and visit the small drawers hall where are drawers of all Parliament members through history with the exemption of the Nazi period whose drawer is black. The only thing I doubt being authentic are the Soviet soldier's graffiti when they captured the bldg - they look too fresh for a 75 years period.
After the tour you're left on your own to admire and climb the fabulous glass Dome and enjoy the views from the Reichstag terrace.
Count on around 2-2,5 hrs for the entire experience, which is really a must do in Berlin and absolutely free.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Worth Visiting,I was totally blown away by this building. If you like architecture then you‚Äôre bound to be moved by this. It‚Äôs almost out of this world. Take time to climb to the top.,"Written March 18, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,A must visit for anyone visiting Berlin,We were unsure what to expect with this tour but were blown away by the experience. After having visited the Capitol and White House in DC we expected this tour to be similar but could not have been more wrong. The building was rebuilt to be contemporary yet also historical at the same time. Having the guided tour is very worth the effort as you are able to get a true sense of the ideology and ask all the questions you didn't even know you would have. The building and governmental system represents a shift of the mindset that is truly unique. The design specifically addresses the atrocities of the past and their commitment to never repeat them. A must on anyone visiting Berlin.,"Written March 18, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,A proud parliamentary building,"A mixture of renaissance and post modern architecture, the building stands proud and restored. Beautiful!",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Guided Tour (Inside),"You have to book in advance vis their website. It was a very interesting and informative tour. The various stages of German history and the relationship to the building was very well explained, as was the make up of the current parliament.
Inside the building is very plain, but has kept a lot of its historical features eg the Russian Graffiti from the second world war. Unfortunately was unable to visit dome as it was closed as a precaution (Covid - 19).
Well with it.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,"Unbelievable late night, after dinner visit to the top of the dome of the Reichstag","We had enjoyed a wonderful dinner at the K√§fer roof top restaurant at the Reichstag building one Monday back in February and afterwards went on to explore the glass dome of this iconic building. It was well after 10 o'clock in the evening and we virtually had the place to ourselves. We had time to read all about the history of the building before slowly walking upwards & around in a spiral towards the very top. The nighttime views of Berlin were fantastic.

I was fascinated by the large mirrored cone in the centre of the dome which apparently directs sunlight into the building. It cleverly allow views right the way down to the main debating chamber a long way below. And I learned that the whole idea of allowing the public access above the debating chamber was to symbolize that people are above the German Government - this certainly wasn't the case during the Nazi years. And the futuristic design of the dome, created by the British architect Norman Foster was designed to herald a departure from Nazism to a modern, reunified Germany.

At that time of night there were hardly any other visitors - just numerous security staff who were more than willing to chat and explain things. I didn't realise, for example that there is no roof at the top of the glass dome - it is open to the elements right up there.

All in all this felt like a private visit to one of the most significant landmarks in Berlin, probably Germany and possibly the world. Unforgettable!!!",
Germany,Reichstag Building,"Booked for next day, arrived, they closed it, so no entry","We booked this Monday at the booking office opposite, for an early Tuesday afternoon visit, on arrival on Tuesday at our allotted time, were told they had closed it the previous day for the day of our visit. It would have been useful if they had taken an email address when we booked, at the time of booking, as it messed our days plans up","Written March 11, 2020"

Germany,Reichstag Building,Interesting Free Tour / Must Pre-Book,"I prebooked the free tour a couple weeks before my trip in January and had no problem getting my first choice of time/date. I was in Berlin for a week in January and the weather was unseasonably warm and clear for my visit; with the exception of the day of my Reichstag tour. It was a cloudy, drizzly, and cold morning when I arrived at the security checkpoint. My tour time was one of the first that morning and there was no waiting; I went right in and went through the airport style security check. From there, a group of tourists was escorted inside the building and to the lift. At the top of the elevator, there is a counter where they hand out the audio guides (the audio activates automatically at different points in the dome). The audio tour is interesting. You can walk around the roof area as well as go up the circular ramp to the top of the dome. It is an impressive building with an interesting history and on clear days, you get a great view of Berlin. The prebooking makes it difficult to plan your visit around the weather (the day before was a picture-postcard, beautiful-blue-cloudless-skies day.
There is a cafe on the roof which can also be prebooked and there are public toilets near the audio guide counter/lifts.","Written March 9, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Make sure you book!,"My partner and I visited The Reichstag when we took a surprise trip to Berlin. As we didn‚Äôt know we were coming to Berlin, we had to research everything when we arrived. Luckily, we researched the Reichstag as you HAVE TO BOOK TO GO IN THE GLASS DOME!!!

It‚Äôs free to book, and we were lucky going in January as I believe it would‚Äôve been harder to book a day or two in advance if it was a busier time.

The Reichstag was incredibly interesting and it was very secure (as expected) but it didn‚Äôt feel rushed looking around. Once inside, you had as much or little time as you wanted to explore the glass dome.

I would say, don‚Äôt go on a rainy day as we couldn‚Äôt look outside as much as we would‚Äôve liked! However, it was a lovely and educational experience.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Treasured experience,"I think many people do not know that they can book in advance and visit the dome for free. I sure didn't, but I'm glad my friend did! We got to see the views and lights of Berlin at night during Christmas market season. (You book to visit during a specific time frame). This is one of the coolest experiences I have had in Europe overall. I had no idea people could enter the dome so it was an amazing surprise when my friend told me she had planned it for us.","Written March 9, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Book early to avoid disappointment,"My wife and I tried to visited the reichstag a couple of years ago was blissfully unaware at the time of the requirement to book in advance, so was disappointed to find that we couldn‚Äôt enter.

I planned ahead this time and booked just under 2 months in advance (just google reichstsg tickets and follow the official link - tickets are free). Well worth the 5-10 minutes that it takes to apply if you book early enough and your desired date/time slot is still available .

On arrival have your letter of invitation (this will be emailed to you) and official ID such as passport or drivers licence with you. Airport style security will provide entry to this building with a huge amount of history behind it.

Free audio tour head sets available in a variety of languages at the top of the lift. I won‚Äôt spoil the rest of it... Enjoy.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Beware of early morning slot - the windows may still be misted up obscuring views,"The dome is a spectacular building and there is a lot of interesting information at its base.
We were provided with clear English audio guides to support our tour up and down the dome.
We booked a few days in advance and confirmed names for the second part of the booking process and this all went smoothly.
The early time slot and cold weather meant that the glass surrounding the dome remained very misted and difficult to see our of.","Written March 8, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Well organised,"We went to this building in December. Since we had no pre booking; we booked at their kiosk across the street.
The place is well organised with high level security.
We were escorted to the glass dome were we received automatic voice guide headsets
The guides were so informative and we learnt a lot.
We had our 8 year old and toddler on stroller.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Shocking staff!!!!,"The view was amazing we had a great time up until we were leaving. My sister and I had asked a security guy who was not busy, simply talking to his colleagues which way the exit was. He shouted aggressively the exit is that way. Then he stomped over to us turned the exit sign (which was faced the wrong way) around slamming it down onto the floor throwing an actual tantrum like a toddler! He turned the sign which was still facing the wrong way and glared at us. Walked off to his friends and spoke about us in their own language. We were completely shocked and it really ruined our whole night. He was one of three at the desk by the lift, we visited on 7th March 2020 at 9.30pm. It was disgusting how we were treated! We all have bad days but don‚Äôt bring it to work.","Written March 7, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Great architecture and views,"You have to be shepherded in through security and up to the dome in large groups, which is a bit of a pain, but once up there you can take your time admiring (and gently climbing) the Richard Rodgers-designed dome and checking out the 360 degree views. Loved it.","Written March 7, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Disturbing lift experience,"Ok nothing special but the lift experience will stay with me forever - for all the wrong reasons .
We booked for the 09:45 session
Security was smooth and easy... then the lift up to the dome
The lift was very full then they squeezed more and more people in - after a visit to the Holocaust memorial I found this very very disturbing
The dome itself was ok nothing special ( nice view of Berlin) , the cafe a bit posh ( more restaurant than cafe)
But will always remember the visit for the horrendous lift experience","Written March 6, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Super views. Resrevation should be made well in advance,"Security is very tight, so prepare for a flight security and dont take along stuff that causes probelms.
Book well in advance otherwise a long queue. . My Berlin friend booked for us both to go. A passport is required, you take this around all the time in Germany so dont forget it now. Staff are efficient and kind.. Non German citizens cannot go into the Parliament hall. The Cupola is our target. The access is well organised - I suggest you get as early appointment as possible though. Lovely views. Coffee and snacks available at the top terrace. Souvenirs are available , also a daily Parlament paper , mine is in German being a German speaker","Written March 6, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Make the reservation!,We got a late appointment and it was a rainy night so we almost didn't go. We were glad we did as it is such an interesting architectural structure.

Just make sure you sign up for entry a few weeks before so that there are spaces available. It was quick to get into. The security were a bit rude in terms of not speaking to us properly but I guess that is what you get when you are going into a government building.

There are information panels giving you a good overview of how the building sits at the heart of German history. The free audio guide kicks in as you walk up the dome describing all the landmarks of Berlin. You can walk around the roof too.

All in all an essential part of a visit to Berlin and even better it is totally free.","Written February 28, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,Iconic and fun with a gourmet surprise on the top!!!!,"It's iconic and represents German determination and resilience. It is a symbol of retaking the promising past of Berlin, which was an important cosmopolitan progressive cultural center and an important city for many ""firsts"" in LGBTQ history in particular, away from the dark presence of a very sinister era. The dome is beautiful and it's fun to go to the very top (it seems). I couldn't do it as I was too tired after walking two days in Paris, then two days in Vienna.... The view is gorgeous. Keep in mind that you should make a reservation to go in during the high season especially. Very annoyingly, you need to go through a security checkpoint and it takes forever to get up to the top. It's far worse than the same experience at the airport. I was here in the low season and it was bad. Be prepared! If you are going to K√§fer, the really great restaurant at the top, make sure you make a reservation and arrive with much time in advance due to the security nuisance which will make you very late if you dont take it into consideration.",

Once through security you get escorted up to the dome. You are given an audio guide in your language which is cleverly done. The audio guide gets triggered at certain points as you work your way up and back down the dome. Helpful for pointing out landmarks and giving you the history of the building. Great views out over the city and a lovely view of the Brandenburg gate. Definitely worth doing.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,A must visit,"We visited on a lovely late afternoon as the sun was setting. After security checks (including passports), we were escorted to the entrance of the main parliament building and up the lift to the impressive dome. Slowly winding your way round the interior ramp of this modern landmark, right to the top, is a treat. Take in the city views and the architectural wonder of the chrome and glass, and enjoy the circular opening at the top that connects you back to the great outdoors and hopefully blue Berlin skies. Book in advance for this refreshingly free visit. We got lucky and popped into the quietish restaurant for a reasonably-priced latte and huge cake between us!",

In addition to walking to the top of the glass dome, you can also walk along the roof top. There are multiple views of the city. There were not big crowds.

On top of the building is a glass dome, where you can listen to the history of the building and the surrounding institutions.","Written February 21, 2020"
Germany,Reichstag Building,A must-see!,"The tour of the Reichstag Dome is a ‚Äòmust-see‚Äô when in Berlin. Visiting at night provides a particularly peaceful experience, not to mention a free view of Berlin‚Äôs skyline lit up.

You will need to book a tour in a small white hut next to the restaurant on the street opposite the building, using your passport. These fill up quickly but can usually be booked on the day. I managed to secure a space on a 21:00-22:00 tour when queuing to register at 18:00pm. This can seem like a bit of a hassle but is definitely worth it.

Small groups are then taken to the top of the building in a lift, where you are free to read information plaques at the bottom of the dome, or stroll to the top of the dome via the spiral staircase that lines the building. Notably, this is accessible and wheelchair friendly. Audio guides are also available but are not necessary unless you would particularly like the extra information a tour guide can provide.

There is also freedom to walk across the roof of the Reichstag, however very few people choose to do this in winter due to cold winds.

If you only want a quick tour, it is easy to be in and out of the building within 20 minutes, however exploring the building at a leisurely pace is a far more rewarding experience. There is also no pressure to leave at the end of your allotted hour, although this may differ in busy periods.",
Germany,Reichstag Building,An impressive building and dome,"You need to book in advance and have passports ready to go to visit as there is a security presence with it being a government building.

Brilliant free thing to do whilst visiting Berlin! Security was good and you needed to bring your confirmation and a form of I.d with you.

The reichstag is a very popular place to go so I recommend you take time to wait in line to go up. They only allow a certain number of visitors at one time and the security is tight because it‚Äôs the Bundestag, their congress. TIP: If you make a reservation at ‚ÄúK√§fer‚Äù online, you will be expedited to the dome. The restaurant isn‚Äôt cheap but worthwhile.

Great views as well. The restaurant is quite formal and expensive.",

Germany,Reichstag Building,Mandatory stop in Berlim,"This ubilding is stanning both from the outside and the inside, but you have to spare a few hours aside to dedicate to this visit. It's free upon booking and worth your time.
You get there, receive a audio guide, take the elevator (quite big one) and go up to see the building from above. You can take a look inside from up there as well. It's nice that you get a beep on your audio guide once you reach a particular point on your walking, it tells you where to look at and also tells you the history of that particular spot. The view is pretty nice and you must register it.
The only down moment for me was on the lawn in front of the building, where I had to carefull dismiss an attempt from two girls that were asking for money.
In general, a very pleasant visit indeed.",

Germany,Reichstag Building,Unique place,"Interesting modern practical architecture, but also very aesthetically peasant. If you can plan a visit, it will be worth it, but if you only want the views, you can get those from Berliner Dome, without prior planning. Reichstag visit is free, but a reservation is needed and it has a specific time slot so you have to plan your day around it. Arrive earlier because there's airport type security. Don't forget to get the audio guide (also free) because without it it's less impressive.

Germany,Reichstag Building,Plan your visit,"You do need to book an appointment so be aware if travelling at peak periods in the year. In January we were able to book for later that day although we opted to book a slot for the next morning. Be aware there is a high level of security and it‚Äôs rather daunting as you need to get into a large glass lift and are packed in!
We went after visiting the Jewish museum and also after reading about personal stories from the holocaust and the horror of being packed into trucks and huts ( in preparation for the atrocities to take place) it seemed rather ironic that we all happily allowed ourselves to be herded into the lift in the same way!!
Excellent commentary and wonderful building.

Germany,Reichstag Building,Impressive,"I recommend reserving a time to enter the Reichstag early in your Berlin stay, your time slot could be several hours or the following day (you choose based on availability). The process is simple, easy, moves fast, results in minimal lines and prevents overcrowding. Once in you get all the time you want so go as fast or slow as you wish.

Walking up into the glass dome your audio highlights different parts of the city, sites, monuments, history, and the operation of the German government. I used to plan some visits later in my trip as well as getting and enjoyable overview of the city and country.

Time of day to visit, that is the question, several people I spoke to recommend dusk. On this visit I went in the evening on a misty night so the views were not as spectacular but the dome takes on a different character at night. Bottom line there is no wrong time of day.

Very enjoyable.",

Germany,Reichstag Building,A very interesting place to visit,I was lucky enough to be able to book a formal tour of the Reichstag which was conducted in English by a very knowledgeable woman.

Germany,Reichstag Building,Beautiful Building,"Sensational building - architecturally very interesting, excellent and free audio providing an explanation of the building and the Berlin skyline.

Germany,Reichstag Building,Fascinating building and brilliantly set up tour,"First things first, you can't just turn up. You need to go online and prebook, and provide them with name, dob, etc of everyone in your party - once you get there there is also airport style security, this is their government building after all!
It's a brilliant place and lots to learn.
The lift takes you up to the glass dome at the top of the building, which has a walkway that gently goes round and up to the very top. While you go up, your audio guide picks up where you are and tells you about what you can see - all VERY clever!
As well as information about what buildings you can see, you also learn something of how the building works, eg the mirrors down the middle of the dome reflecting light down into the room below - also VERY clever!
Highly recommend it",
Germany,Reichstag Building,Very interesting,First thing to note is that you must apply to visit in advance and you need to take ID with you. Don‚Äôt let this put you off. The view from the dome is awesome. We went after dark and seeing the city lit up was lovely however the commentary is slightly harder to follow as you can‚Äôt necessarily see the landmarks identifying features that it tells you to look out for. The visit includes information on the history of the building including old pictures.,

I registered for our tour one month before our trip. We did not get the guided tour as we did not feel this was necessary. If possible it would be nice to visit on a day when the Bundestag is in session as you would be able to look down from the glass dome and view their proceedings.

Germany,Reichstag Building,A must do but DON'T get a tour! You can see the dome for free,"Well worth doing and if you're not after a guided tour of the whole building and just want to go up the dome, don't get an overpriced tour you can just register yourself and the entire experience is free!

You have to register your intention to visit which you can do on their website. Indicate what day and time and how many people and it shows what spaces are free, you select what you want, and they will contact you back with confirmation. I booked for myself and my daughter at 6am on the morning of our visit, selected the 8.30am slot and had confirmation by 7.45am. This is also a great time to go btw as i'm led to believe that the queues get pretty long. Once in you can pick up a 'free' audio tour in the language of your choice, which identifies the major landmarks in the city that you can see from the dome and tells you about the history of the building and a bit more besides.

Germany,Reichstag Building,Great Starting Point,"This is a good at no cost way to get a panoramic view of Berlin so that you can plan the rest of your visit. It also introduces some of the main concepts that it is important to grasp if you want to start to understand the unique history of Berlin. The important thing to remember is that you must book an appointment online in advance and then when you arrive at the reception area be able to show photo ID to gain admission. Once you have been through security you will be taken as part of a group to enter the building and up in a lift to the roof terrace. On the terrace you can collect an audio guide. You enter the dome. In the centre there is a presentation which explains the origin of the German state, the Reichstag and Bunderstag, the rise of national socialism, the division of Germany and the development of the new building by Norman Foster. You can then walk up the ramp and as you proceed the audio guide tells you more and indicates the various important city landmarks. On a good day you can see for miles. Once at the top you can also look down and may be able to see the Bundestag in session. You leave by walking down a second ramp. We also went to the restaurant which is on the roof terrace. It is not the cheapest place to eat but it is lovely. Some people just had a hot drink.",

Germany,Marienplatz,"Beautiful with history, architecture and ambience","To be fair, we had an image in our minds as to how Marienplatz would look, feel and sound. It's because of Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within (and yes, I realize how nerdy that makes me sound!)

At any rate, all the images we'd had in our heads went right out the window the second we stepped out of the Bahnhof and saw the millions of Christmas Market stalls in our faces.

NOT that I'm complaining! I was in Christmas Market heaven.

We visited Marienplatz several times over the course of our five-day stay. It was crowded - except for early in the morning, which was my favorite time to visit.

We did visit some of the ""local"" type stores on the Platz, but avoided the chains we know from home. It was easy to get lost and turned around with all the stalls and the side streets, but it was an amazing adventure.

Marienplatz served as a kind of ""home base"" for us while we were in Munich. It was comfortable, had a good variety of restaurants and shops, and had a wonderful vibe. I loved the history and the architecture, and how central it all was.

I would love to go back in another season, to visit the Platz without the market stalls (did I really say that?), and to see the area in sun and warmth. To, you know, see it as it was depicted in Gabriel Knight. Nerd alert!",

Despite being full of people on Christmas Eve we never felt and danger of being pickpocketed, unlike similar places in different cities, but caution is - as always - advised.

Get off the main street and about a block behind the New Town Hall, and by the cathedral, there are some very good and reasonably priced restaurants which are full of locals. Always a good sign as often centrally located restaurants in tourist areas are bad and expensive. We had lunch in this are on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day (when admittedly there wasn't much choice apart from fast food chains) and yet weren't disappointed at all.",

Germany,Marienplatz,Go for the Christmas Market,"The Marienplatz is transformed during late November and December to a wonderful Christmas market, with stands set up to buy handmade Christmas ornaments and gifts, and to sell street food and the special ‚ÄúGluhwein‚Äù or spiced, hot red wine. In the Christmas season the Gluhwein is a ‚Äúmust do‚Äù activity - on a cold evening buy a little ceramic cup of the hot liquid (8 Euro - but you get 4 back when you return the cup). It‚Äôs not as extensive as the larger Christmas markets in, for example, Nuremberg, but it is also not as crowded and you get a little bit of everything here!",
Germany,Marienplatz,Purely commercial.,"I don‚Äôt know what we were expected but hoped to be imbued with the Christmas spirit. But sadly we found it generally lacking. There were numerous stalls generally selling over-priced decorations, sausages and mulled wine. Despite the huge crowds, there was a total lack of Christmas music or charity. Even our small local mall manages to give you the Salvation Army brass band playing carols. Where were the choirs or German oompah bands in Munich? I‚Äôm afraid the Marienplatzn was very much a purely commercial experience.","Written December 16, 2019"

Since we had never visited as a couple, or during December, we made the choice to stay to visit the Christmas markets. While Munich was wonderful, the markets were a complete waste of time. Maybe I had the wrong expectation, but I was expecting a cute market with lots of lovely local foods and local craft stalls. Man, was I wrong!
It was all cheap stuff or pre-packaged goods you might finds anywhere. What a waste of our time!

We could barely see the booths because of the people standing in front of them, not moving, not buying, just standing there. I keep hearing about how Christmas markets are ‚Äúmagical‚Äù.

Germany,Marienplatz,Christmas Market 2010,"This review is based on the Christmas Market Marienplatz as opposed the the place alone.

The main square offers a huge array of stalls with crafts and other festive items to buy. But I'd say about 75% of the stalls are food and drink. They operate a fun method if getting gl√ºhwein, with each stall offering a different style of drink container, from a simple cup with a winter marienplatz scene on it, to a ceramic boot! All the stalls will top up any drinking vessel. You can return your cup for your refund back or keep the item for a souvenir.

The square itself offers a great background with all of its historic buildings and the giant Christmas tree looks as festive as you can get at night.

Its quieter during the day so if you want an easier life looking round, go during the day for shopping, and then head back at night to simply soak it (and gl√ºhwein) up! Be sure to visit the near by medieval market too as this offers extra activities, drinking vessels and foods not found in the square!",
Germany,Marienplatz,Great location,"Central to public transport connections for the airport and the main Munich attractions, this beautiful square is situated close to the old town and within easy walking distance of the Residenz Palace.

We originally did not plan to visit this attraction, because it seemed too kitschy and touristy to us. We changed our minds due to the recommendation of a local and we are so glad we did.

This wonderland is so detailed and quite faithful to the places that it represents. It is amazing to see the intricate detail and how the various vehicles and lighting work together to create a tiny world of activity.

We highly recommend purchasing your tickets in advance. This place is very popular and there are long lines for buying tickets. We were only able to get tickets for 10:30pm, but we went ahead and visited at that time rather than miss the experience.

It was worth it, but it does get tiring to enjoy the Wunderland past midnight after a full day of sightseeing. Go earlier in the day, if possible, and be prepared to spend hours enjoying all the details and amazing technology that enables this miniature world to come to life!",

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,A must-see on a trip to Hamburg,"The Miniatur Wunderland is not only Hamburg¬¥s most famous attraction, but is also regularly voted as Germany¬¥s Top 1 place to visit.

To be honest I didn‚Äôt expect much before my visit and thought I will just take a small round, as I am not a big fan of model trains. But this place is so much more than a museum of model trains. What has actually started small is nowadays the biggest model railway system in the world according to the Guinness-Book.

The museum is divided into different country and theme areas and lighting will change periodically from daylight to night-time. What I found most fascinating is the indescribable love for details. Every single person or thing in the display reflects 100% reality. You really have to see it, as words can¬¥t do justice. For a visit I would at least plan for around 2-3 hours, actually you could spend the whole day in there. If you like to know more about my visit to there, see also on traveltreasuresbymarion",

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,World‚Äôs Largest Miniature Railroad Wonderland for All Ages to Marvel and Enjoy,"Upon arriving at the long multi-story red brick building, we got off our taxi. The building‚Äôs wall had signs ‚ÄúHamburg Dungeon‚Äù and ‚ÄúBelleisenbahn Wunderland‚Äù. We almost entered the wrong door for ‚ÄúHamburg Dungeon‚Äù. Be sure to enter the correct door for the Miniatur Wunderland. Inside the building, we walked upstairs following the sign ‚ÄúMiniatur Wunderland‚Äù. An elevator was nearby, too. At the ticket counter, we bought our tickets with the entrance time marked on them. Since we did not purchase our tickets in advance, we had to wait for about 20 minutes in the large waiting area next to the ticket counter. Advance purchase of tickets could have avoided this. The waiting area had complimentary beverages counter as well as comfortable seats & tables. On the walls, electronic display screens showed the numbers. Once the numbers on our tickets showed up on the displays, we went to the entrance to the exhibition area. The exhibition areas spread over 3 floors had many halls with model railway sets representing different countries & regions such as Austria, Middle Germany, Hamburg, Italy, Knuffingen, Scandinavia, Switzerland, Venice, America, etc. We were really impressed with painstakingly detailed miniaturized railroads and Hamburg airport scenes. While walking around, we faced recurring blackouts to show alternating day and night scenes. Over 2 hour period, we could see only a fraction of the world‚Äôs largest miniature wonderland in this establishment.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Didn't like it at all.,"This place is overcrowded, so it is impossible to really enjoy looking at anything.

Some of the models are more complex than others, and might present some fascination in terms of their elaborate constructions, but fundamentally this is like paying for the privilege to enter a can of sardines.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazing with something for everyone!,"This is my third time visiting Miniatur Wunderland and each time I am amazed at the breadth, scope, and attention-to-detail found here. The ""Find This"" game in the brochure ws especially fun and really encouraged us to look carefully in each location so that we could find the scene that was pictured. Having the lights dim and brighten to show the passage of time is clever, especially when the traffic lights transition to just blinking during the nighttime and then working again once it is daytime again.

This was my first visit with kids (5 and 3 years old) and they were entranced. We spent more than 3 hours there; they especially loved seeing the shuttle take off in Florida and looking for Santa in Sweden. My husband and I could have been there for longer, but their attention started to lag at the 3-hour mark. This is a place that I highly recommend to anyone traveling to Hamburg -- it is definitely worth a visit!","Written August 4, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Superb visit,"I really really love the Miniature land. I can spend hours and hours watching the landscape, people, buildings, situations and hidden funny findings.

I dont post photos of this, since there is so many already.","Written July 29, 2020"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Impressive miniature world-travel,"This place is definetly worth a visit, bith with/without kids. Placed in one of the old buildings near the harbour, you find this very ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù tourist attraction. It is an amazing travel through a lot of countries, with incredible details and a lot of small stories going on in the landscape if you look closely. It is both a fun and different tourist experience, but do take the time to discover the details, and get impressed by the many hours of work that lies behind it! Remember to book your tickets good time ind advance, and TAKE YOUR TIME to see it all. Not a place that you should rush thru. We were about 2 hours and 15 minutes to see it all, and we didnt see everything.

The ‚Äúworld‚Äù consists of a lot of Germany, but they are still building new countries. Take your time to read the little notes, that will tell you a lot about the things you see.","Written July 21, 2020"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,"Fantastic, even though you are not into miniature trains....","It's amazing how many man-hours they have put into this and even though I am not a big fan of model trains, this place has been created down to the last details and if you look closely there are a lot of hidden humoristic gems ....",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazing experience and must-see in Hamburg!,I‚Äôve visited the Miniatur Wunderland for the 3rd time now and it is fantastic how I still found some amazing details and funny easter eggs everywhere (even though I spend hours there the first two times). It is just crazy detailed and one can see that people are not building the model for money or prestige but for passion!,"Written July 13, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Must-see when in Hamburg,"The other reviews certainly weren't wrong.

Wonderland markets itself as the world's largest model railway. But it's so much more. A true to detail miniature replica of many places including Hamburg the airport with actual flight movements, Austria, Venice, Switzerland, soon Monaco (it's under building as of July 2020).

One can easily spend 3 hrs here, even though the exhibits dont cover that big an area.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,"In the details you""ll find more joy","It""s honestly too much to take in for one day. The airport alone can be enjoyed for hours on end. If you walk through and see the overall construction you""ll have a great time as scenes change between day and night, but, if you take a closer look you""ll notice a lot more detail like a murder scene, ET flying home, and a couple having sex in their apartment :)

Super for families and kids as well.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Just brilliant,"If you like this sort of thing, this will blow your socks off. Even if you don't - go and take a look anyway. It's fascinating, impressive and funny. Given the work that has gone it, it is worth the entrance price several times over. Even liked the cafe (carriage) for a beer afterwards. Just go, if you can....","Written March 14, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Really impressed!,"First of all, the museum impressed me the magnitude of hard work of those who participated in it's creation: in 9 rooms you can see entire cities and lands in miniature with day and night light simulating, intertwined by the railways and the roads. Everything moves, sometimes accompanied by sound signals. Most of all I liked Hamburg in miniature. There are a lot of visitors, so it is best to choose the earliest or latest time. The bus numero 6 goes to the Wunderland from the city center and the main train station to the final stop.","Written March 8, 2020"

Use public transport to get there and bring plenty of time as there is so much detail going on!! Day, night, trains, ports, mountains, cities, planes, etc - very impressive! Suggest you go as late as possible (pm) if you can. The place gets insanely crowded during the regular hours. Spend some time in the souvenir shop afterwards, great stuff and good value for money! Great place overall!!",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Not so wunder,I liked the feature to buy tickets and a timeslot in advance. But I had expected more activity trainwise. The transition from day to night was amazing.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Impresive but crowded,"By the time I got there, it was pretty empty but after an hour or so, it got really really crowded. I would recommend to visit early in the morning if possible, to avoid waiting in order to see the cities and constructions. I would say that, if you enjoy the collection and want to see it all (in detail) you need almost 3h . Cities are represented by day/by night (which was very impressive - also wait to see volcanic eruption, thunderstorm and many more).
Ticket price was 15.50 euros online (someone purchased it for me in Germany). I'm still not sure why for the same ticket the price shown on my phone was 18.50 euros.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Very impressive but over crowded,"I have big respect of the people making this Miniature Wonderland happening.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Lives up to expectations,"This is much more than a model railway - it's a miniature world!
Regions included are Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Scandinavia and America.
One suggestion for improvement: take out America and put in Britain. This is where railways started, it's in Europe (more in keeping with the theme) and is the home of wonderful heritage railways that could, in part, be modelled. The British also make-up the largest number of visitors from a country not covered by the modelling.","Written February 24, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazing place,"Excellent place. We spent around 3 hours here and probably could have spent longer. The models are awesome and we especially loved it when the light dimmed to see the models ‚Äúat night‚Äù. We visited the cafe for lunch which was delightful and loved the seating (as if you were on a train).
It‚Äôs so hard to describe the detail that is put into these displays without having seen it. It‚Äôs just spectacular. I‚Äôd recommend a visit and we will return as they were constructing another two lands whilst there and would love to see them once finished",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazing!,"I thought I would be bored after an hour. But the details, funny quirks (ET in a bicycle half way up a mountain!), interactive buttons, the daytime changing into night every half (?) hour. Watch a palace break into fire (smoke coming from the roof, flames through the windows) then the fire engines are despatched to combat the fire. We spent 6 hours here and would have gone back the next day if I could. Attention to detail was amazing! Cafe food reasonable prices too!","Written February 23, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Incredible detail - unmissable,The attention to detail is incredible - I spent three hours here and could have stayed all day. This is by far the best attraction of its type I've ever been to. To call it a model railway doesn't do it justice.,

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Fun but full,"We looked in the website for the waiting times and went on the moment it said 0 minutes which was absolutely correct and saved us ‚Ç¨5 by not having to book a fast lane ticket. The miniature cities and countries were very beautiful, detailed, funny with little hidden easter eggs and interesting to see. Especially the airport really was amazing to see! It was very full at the beginning so it was sometimes hard to see everything or the get in front to push the buttons. But later it was calmer and we got to see things better. We spent around 2 hours here and it was worth the money. I must say though that it was an experience that I will not do again. It was great, yes, but also a bit ""boring"" after a while because at the end it is the same all the time. I would recommend it to families with kids. For adults that are not that much into railways or miniature things it can be bit boring.",

All the details are perfect and you can see also how it works since there are cuts in the wood. It is also very interactive for kids: in each place there are push buttons to see something moving or turning on lights.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,First Class,I have been wanting to go here for many years and went with my grown up son in January. We were not disappointed - what a fabulous experience. Exceeded all our high expectations - so much detail and such a huge three stories high extensive and amazing set of layouts with over 17 km of track. The airport terminal is AMAZING. Would return again gladly - so much to see. It was better towards end of the evening when crowds were thinning. We flew for the day with Ryanair from Stansted.

As night falls every fifteen minutes, you experience a whole new world. An airport with all the moving parts including take offs and landings, a volcano, a concert, a harbor, trains, the wild West, Las Vegas... Even a miniature Venice. We could have spent another couple hours exploring, as it was we spent almost 4 just mesmerized by the shear scope of this miniature land.

If you are now planning a trip to Europe, please include one more day and visit Miniatur Wunderland. It as a model railroad display in HO scale (small trains) where imagination will absolutely amaze you. Google it! Visit it! You will tell others about your experience. Allow at least four to six hours. Yes, there is so much to see and enjoy. PS When WE visit Europe again, Miniatur Wunderland will be a stop for us!",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Left a sour taste,"I'm drawn to writing this review after my experience at visiting this attraction. Arrival was very much as expected. You climb stairs to gain entry although there is a lift for disabled visitors. I had prebooked my ticket and this is generally advisable but on my visit was not really needed as the queues were very small. I put this down to being a week day, first thing in the morning so it's best I think to visit then. Also out of term time as well. The display was as been said very impressive, but the German section which I believe was the first area is showing some signs of wear now and needs a bit of loving care on it. There are lockers to place your rucksacks in but are not good for the very large ones, they cost a euro but that is returned when you retrieve your items.

Now the clincher for me I had pre booked the behind the scenes tour, I was told to go to the temporary control point which is where all the layout is controlled from. The appointed time came and no one turned up, on asking one of the operatives I found out I should of been at the old control point. By the time I got there I had missed the tour. I went to complain about the miss information I was given the only response I got you can have your money back. No effort was made to find out if I could of joined the tour or any real apology for the error, or if something could be done. A lesson in customer service here is needed. Yes there is a sign at the temp control station but this gives the impression your in the correct place. So this is a warning to others not to fall not this trap like I did.

As a result this did put a dampener on my visit hence 3 stars.","Written February 6, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Absolutely Mind Blowing!,"Amazing place! Incredible attention to detail and an insane amount of electronic and computer wizardry has gone into this! Way to much to take in. I would definitely do this again, and take an entire day to look around. We had the guided tour where we got to learn the 'secrets' of how it all works, and see stuff the general public don't get to see. Well worth doing. I can HIGHLY RECOMMEND this attraction to anyone with any respect of creativity and workmanship...and it's just good fun. Staff all friendly, everything clean. One thing that may be good is the occasional 'over 18s' evening where we don't have to suffer a million hyped-up children!Thanks for a great experience!",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Must visit place at Hamburg!,"Whenever I was visiting Hamburg I woshed to come there. The place are very busy, but it do not disturb pleasant views and so on. I was surprised how many figures, cars, planes, ships and action buttons are there. The place are very suitable for kids as well. I wish I will take my kid there when I will come back there. I have really enjoyed Germany, Switzerland and Italy there over the 15 minutes day light and night. Great work!",

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Fascinating...a must-see attraction...and a great value!,"We recently spent a few weeks traveling throughout Germany and specifically visited Hamburg to tour this attraction. The Minatur Wunderland was one of the highlights of our trip and I highly recommend for everyone...great for children to seniors! The numerous exhibits are individually fascinating and, in total, cover 2 entire floors of an old warehouse. The staff's attention to detail within each different exhibit is absolutely amazing and they do a great job of capturing every-day life in their working models. I loved the staff's sense of humor...from Pinocchio's growing nose to some sexually explicit scenes hidden in some exhibits (You'll have to look close to find them!) Everything is on full display including watching the artists work on improving existing exhibits and/or new & upcoming projects at several different work stations. There is a sliding pricing schedule for admission...from children to seniors, a restaurant and souvenir shop on site so you can spend as much time as you wish. The Minatur Wunderland is the BEST miniature exhibit that I've ever seen and would jump at an opportunity to visit again to see what's new!","Written January 16, 2020"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Great for all ages,"For the price, it was great value. The level of detail in all the figures was incredible. I thought the Hamburg working airport exhibit was fascinating.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Spellbinding!,"I didn't want to waste the day adjusting to the time change so I made a point to get out and explore.

Staying in the St Pauli/Reeperbahn part of town, I looked up how to get to the Miniatur Wunderland, after hearing raves from other friends who have already come to Hamburg.

I am not a sophisticated traveler.

I wing it and don't make lists of what to see.

This was a way for me to take a bus and wander to the area. I could have walked but already paid for a 4 day Hamburg pass.

The Miniatur Wunderland is in a quieter marine area and it's housed in a large old warehouse.

There is an elevator and it is on a couple of floors.

The overhead lights change periodically and it highlights the many working lights of displays and vehicles.

Mostly it is just wowing over the little marvels of miniature versions of places and areas all over the globe.

Even a mini airport with a display screen of arrivals and departures!

I loved the tiny drive-in with mini movies.
There is a multi-level Swiss mountain with different vantage points and a working movement ski lift.

There's trains, planes, cars, trucks and boats moving. Around mountains, cars do a right of way wait.

They even track where people visit from. And have a LED counting tally.

The volcano has steam/smoke emitting from it and the lights mimicking lava looks great.

Plan to give yourself time of about 1.5-2 hours or more if you like.

It is of course, family-friendly, and wheelchairs can manage.

Even trains have a see-through track on the floor.

And the repair and planning/construction areas are visible, but not accessible to the public.

Which means you can come and it doesn't mean it's the same old thing every visit.

They are proud of their work and they even have an old TripAdvisor award up on the wall.

I would keep the inner child amazed, and would do this again in a heartbeat!",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,AMAZING! Best tourist attraction ever,"I expected to have an hour here, but spent over 3 hours walking and going wow. Its incredible.
Forget that the entrance isn't that great - that's only because its in a tidal flood area. Once you go in, lose yourself and get down low and close to maximise the experience. Have a look for the naughty bits - that makes it good fun!","Written January 13, 2020"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Miniature Amazement!,"I‚Äôd heard so much about this place being a big fan of model railways but never did I think it would live up to all the hype. From the moment you walk in your jaw drops and it doesn‚Äôt lift up for a good few hours after you‚Äôve left. I‚Äôm still thinking about how wonderful it was days after visiting.

The level of detail is incredible. The size of it is incredible. The animations are incredible. The whole thing is just incredible. I‚Äôd advise going early or late so it‚Äôs not too busy otherwise you may struggle to see as much as you‚Äôd want. If you‚Äôre a fan of these types of things they do a behind the scenes tour. If I ever visit Hamburg again I‚Äôm definitely going on this tour.

We spent 6 hours there and had to leave only because we had another engagement. Entrance fee was 15 euros for the 2 of us and its definitely worth the money. Knuffingen airport was our favourite section and we kept coming back to it again and again. We were hoping that Monaco might have been completed but it wasn't, so now we have another reason to visit this awesome place again.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Brilliant way to spend a few hours ( even if you not a railway fan),"This is a brilliant exhibition to visit. Several floors filled with model railways from around the world, it includes a fully operational airport, working boats and hundreds of models of famous buidings from around the world. Besides the model trains it features fully working roadways. The cameo scenes are outstanding and include a working volcano !!
There is an excellent restaurant available.
A couple of tips to note,
Try and pre book your tickets and get there early as it can get very busy and you could have to wait for a time slot to enter.
All details are on their website.
Make sure you know how to get there as it is not signposted greatly !!

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Give yourself plenty of time,"Went along as had heard rave reviews from others. The attention to detail is extraordinary and there are lots of buttons to press that then makes part of the model move. Fascinating to watch the traffic lights and railway crossings, even the lorries have brake lights and indicators! I probably found the airport the most fascinating with planes landing, taking off and taxi-ing to and from gates. Venice was delightful with rocking gondolas and great attention to detail. We spent three hours there and could have spent at least another hour or two so give yourself plenty of time.","Written January 10, 2020"

Easy access to all, prams have to be left in a secure waiting area, but wheel chair accessible to all floors and exhibits. Exhibits are breath taking so a camera is a must. Nice cafe area with reasonable menu. Gift shop with a wide variety of tourist membrbelia from cheap and tacky to decent items. Book this in advance as the queues can be over an hour. Easy to get to by train (a 15 min walk or by No 6 bus). Wear comfy shoes. Leave big bags and coats at the desk for 50cents per item and enjoy yourself.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,"Excellent model world exhibition, allow plenty of time to see it all.","This is so much more than a model train exhibition - there are some fantastic scale towns and villages that have to be seen to be believed.The Airport is extraordinary, with planes that actually go down the runway and take off. We arrived around 10 AM and had to wait in the restaurant area for 50 minutes, so it's worth checking if you can buy a ticket in advance and secure an entry time. You need to allow several hours to see it all, we spent 3 1/2 hours there and had to rush through the last few exhibits, so next time we will start at the other end. There are several new exhibits to be launched later this year. We thought it was brilliant and if we return to Hamburg will certainly visit again.","Written January 8, 2020"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Late night visit to miss the crowds,"This is not a model railway display, this is a piece of art. Honestly, the whole thing is so well engineered that it being called a 'Model Railway' is just ludicrous. You are taken from place to place, country to country, scene to scene in beautifully crafted vignettes that just happened to have railways, roads, rivers and even aeroplanes in them. The sculpted scenery is stunning and the animations are very cleverly done. Lighting alternates from day to night and changes the whole perspective as it cycles through.
Yes, it can and does get full of visitors, is that a surprise? But plan ahead, buy a ticket before arriving and go straight in.
Sadly, it is not wheelchair friendly and to be fair, I cannot see how any display of this nature can be so as viewing is best done from somewhere higher than a sitting position.
So, if you like seeing well crafted miniaturised recreations, then this is a must. If you are somebody who would rather have a tooth drilled without anaesthetic than go to a model railway, (as I see some reviewers have put) then stay away and spend time elsewhere. If you do visit, allow at least four hours.","Written January 7, 2020"

We were in awe of the workmanship which has gone into this wonderland. The airport is particularly impressive. Not as extensive as we‚Äôd expected but worth a good couple of hours.

Miniatur Wonderland is a really nice exhibition of different worlds with trains around it. The craftsmanship of the worlds is amazing and one could spend a lot of time admiring all that. Unfortunately we picked the wrong time and the exhibit was very crowded, including with people who wanted to video every single detail.
This took away a lot of the charm: it would have been a lot nice to experience the day and night sceneries without all these mobile phones in front of your face.

When I arrived, I saw many parents with their children waiting for the hourly admissions.

The airports with the planes lining up and taking off were probably my favorites. Seeing is believing in this museum...a true Wonder!","Written December 31, 2019"

There are a series of displays set over two floors. It was very busy when we visited and this can detract from the enjoyment. The lights periodically dim so you can see the scenes at night.

It was amazing and my wife and I agreed that we could easily have spent several hours if not days here to fully explore all there is to see. The scale and detail are beyond anything I have seen in a UK model village and every scene is full of humour. Planes take off, land and taxi. Vehicles drive without slots to guide them and indicate to change direction. Scenes from around the world and Germany are painstakingly recreated. All are animated and have special sections which can be activated at the push of a button. We squeezed it into 2 hours but would have liked to have spent longer. Thoroughly recommended to anyone of any age. We booked online and had no problems with queuing.

I stood transfixed staring at the airport for an hour not moving. I was gobsmacked. Lunch was nice in the bistro, nice touch with the train seats by the way.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Mesmerising - a great day out for all ages.,"This is our second visit. The sheer scale of this place is mind blowing and the attention to detail is incredible. One trip is never enough. The scenes which are depicted also have a subtle sense of humour for the adults to enjoy! Everyone adores the airport - what‚Äôs not to like about watching the Death Star take off!?
Love the way the lights dim every so often to replicate night which adds another dimension to the experience. There is so much to see and it takes about 4 hours to see everything but that was with a short break for food in the middle .
I‚Äôm travelling with a young child with learning difficulties and have no issues here, he is absolutely mesmerised with things to see above him and below his feet.
There are plenty of clean accessible toilets, a cloak room and lockers, a great well stocked restaurant - reasonably priced with loads of choice and plenty of seats and even equipment & space for nursing mothers. A Huge shop with lots for little children to buy, so not all expensive stuff.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazing,"Came here on a cruise, shuttle bus from cruise terminal into town and then it‚Äôs a short and easy walk to this location.

The models are impressive and the attention to detail in somewhat amazing. They have cars, Busses, trucks and fire stations that drive around and stop. Trains and boats driving around by themselves.. staggering.

Then you get to the model airport.. to my utter belief the planes take off and land all by themselves... they even take off at different angles to the what a plane of that size would do.

You can easily spend all day here.. just try to avoid when kids go!! I would also prebook a time slot .. or when you get there pick a slot and go wander rather than waiting.

Halfway round they really need to put a little coffee shop in .. I got hungry and needed coffee and had to wait !!

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Don't rush your visit.,"Having seen this on UK tv or somewhere I was intrigued. Could it really be that big or good? Having left the Hamburg DBH I immediately went the wrong way so got a cab, about $10 (euro) Dec 2019, to the door. It was actually very easy to find if I'd left the station the right way.

I had a pre booked ticket and went straight through to the bag/coat drop. For 1 euro leave the baggage in a safe place. Toilets and a cafe are inside as is a shop for all of your mementos of your visit.

Up the stairs, or lift, and you're met with the workshops and small displays, which gives an idea of what's to come, a concert in a sports stadium. Hundreds of people sat in the stadium with a concert on a stage, as would happen anywhere in the world.

In the main displays there are various city, rail displays and an airport. Each display shows a different city around the world. For me the Swiss mountain display beats everything hands down, although the rest are also nothing to be sniffed at. The work and detail put into the displays are exceptional.

During your visit you'll find the lights dimmed for the night views of the displays and yet again these are amazing with house lights coming on then off.

You're not limited to only stay in your 'timed slot' and are welcome to stay till closing. It's worth going around again as I'm sure you'll see something that you missed first time around.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Absolutely Beguiling!,"Expected a German version of Mardurodam. Got a totally unique experience. A little uneasy, since you must pass through a huge gift shop to enter the exhibition, but once inside it was fascinating. The exhibits right inside the entrance, showing a village at different stages in history, were terrific. I read a lot of history, and the short synopsis that accompanied each era was the most thorough and thought provoking I‚Äôve run across, and each point was illustrated by a scene in miniature to be found in the village. VERY well done. Once inside the main exhibition, everyone became a kid. How could you not? Just a remarkable morning, not at all the tourist trap I initially feared. I have three recommendations for your visit: 1.) allow adequate time. We only allotted two hours and I could easily have spent a couple more 2.) spend the time reading the video presentation at the beginning where the eras of the village are 3.) consider going later in the day to avoid the hoards of (mostly well behaved and overjoyed) preschoolers and perhaps 4.) consider taking reading glasses.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,A must-see,"This one is a must-see when you visit Hamburg. All these miniature things are all handmade, and you'll need hours to watch all the details.

The Millenium Falcon from Star Wars on the airport is one of them, but there are many, many smaller ones.

I had obviously not pre-booked, and although there was no queue to buy tickets I had to wait 20 minutes in the holding area (but was glad of the warmth and a sit down - there's a cafe there too). Within minutes of entering exhibition itself, I reckoned the entry price was more than worth it. I know that in 2 hours I probably missed loads of the detail, but this was a truly amazing experience. I have been to model exhibitions before and been underwhelmed, but this one was not only fabulously detailed and varied, but went on and on. The night and day experiences really add to the magic and mean that you need to see each part of the display for a decent length of time. I particularly liked the moving road traffic and the airport, in addition to the trains. A particular hit also was the music festival site. I have managed to fool several people with my photographs.",

It's about modelling people, and places and reflecting a version of our world back to us.We also took the backstage tour for for EUR15 extra. Worth every cent to understand the detail that is involved. Thanks to Lars our knowledgeable and friendly guide. Strongly recommended.","Written December 6, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,EXCELLENT FOR THOSE WITH IMAGINATION,"The up's and downs....

I first visited this just after it was opened over 16 years ago with my girlfriend and we always said we would return, which we did with a colleague Dec 2019 to see how it's grown.

For us - it was a fantastic experience and well worth the visit - again looking at the new country locations added, the technology that's gone into the building of it and the sheer scale of it all. The programming of the planes landing, taxiing to their bays and taking off, the cars which follow the various roads with lights and indicators, the various emergencies that are reacted to and so on. The actual models and scenes are brilliant and one can spend alot of time just looking in one area, spotting the little cameos and amusing set-ups which are invariably there. Some are very representative of actual places whilst other scenes are loosely based on a typical location but, a small amount of imagination is all that's needed. The nighttime changeover is fabulous with hundreds of thousands of lights on the cars, buildings and various elements.

However, I did read with sadness and incredulity some of the crass comments made by some in this review and can only say judging by a few, they are written by those with no imagination or whose sole ability for enjoyment is getting drunk in a bar.

Yes - it is popular so there is the chance it could be crowded consequently, it is definitely worth pre-booking tickets for a time-slot entry. Unfortunately, there will be lots of children especially school trips (best to avoid weekends if possible) and children do get hyper...!!!

I will warn those who are in a wheelchair that sadly, this is not the exhibition to visit on a general day although the centre has now organised 'wheelchair only' days to overcome this, so suggest you enquire. For the infirm and those with standing issues, this could also be difficult - sadly it's the nature of the exhibition and difficult to address.

However, if you enjoy models, have a good imagination and wish to see what can be achieved by the hard work and imagination of others... this is the place to come. My grandson is now 1 year old. In another 10 years or so, i'll be revisiting with him to see what new countries and technologies have been added.

I hope you have the same enjoyable experience we did if you go.","Written December 6, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Breathtaking miniature wonder that is hard to explain... a must do while in Hamburg!,No words to describe this place! It is quite an adventure that allows you to immerse yourself into a wonderful miniature world. Breathtaking illustration of many wonderful places that define our world. You truly feel as if you were traveling all these places. Meticulous attention to detail to portray the traits of every place in the world that they so carefully have put together. Kudos to the people who put this wonder together. Suitable for all ages. Everyone will be impressed. Just showing a few pictures from the portrayal of Italy in order to avoid spoilers. This a must do!,

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazing! & hard to fathom,"Due to a rainy day, my 24yo daughter & I spent the afternoon exploring this fascinating museum. We went through several times and I know I still didn‚Äôt see it all! The details are beyond mind blowing. The USA was represented by the Southwest (an accurate mileage sign on I-15) & a few other places. Many other places I‚Äôve visited I recognized immediately. The lights dim with dusk, all the nightlights come on. Excellent experience for all ages. (I can‚Äôt wait to return with my husband; he will LOVE this place) Nice climate message from GretaThunberg too. All around fantastic experience!",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Wonderful Wunderland,"We spent 3 hours lost in miniature landscapes each better than the last. Such imagination attention to detail and cunning engineering.

A must-see if you are in Hamburg, regardless of your age. Get lost touring the world for a couple of hours.

We finished off our visit with a meal in the themed restaurant. Good food, reasonably priced, and great views from the carriage windows.

Thoroughly recommend a visit.","Written December 4, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Best attraction in Hamburg,You must visit. That's all I can say. Amazing value ‚Ç¨15 for adult. Just superb. Had to wait an hour to get in but you can wait in the restaurant where snacks and drinks are available and they provide free soft drinks. Definitely worth the wait. Spent ages in the the exhibit. The detail of the miniature displays is just superb. Brilliant as the lights go down and the exhibit is in dark every so often so you see the displays all lit up. Can't recommend enough. Not posting pictures as they don't do the place justice. If you go to Hamburg you definitely need to visit. Fabulous and suitable for all ages.,"Written December 3, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Very interesting!,"I was really surprised with it. Not that I was expecting it to be bad, just not so rich! Very interesting and realistic displays of several different cities in US and Europe. Be aware it can be a little crowded, so allow enough time to be able to get close to the displays (you will miss the details if you just stand behind) and move throughout the different floors.","Written December 3, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Absolutely amazing,"We discovered this place by chance, just googling attractions in Hamburg, but then I had to have a look before we left town.

It is AMAZING!!!

Housed in a 3 floor old dockside warehouse, there are model displays, in HO gauge, of different countries and cities all over the world!
The display of Switzerland is 2 stories high, with a huge mountain, nearly 20ft high..

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,The 1st attraction in Germany. Plus a little more to boot.,"Neuschwanstein castle adorns the covers of all travel guides in Germany, which makes up the belief that it is number 1 in the top of the main sites in Germany. However, sociology is a stubborn thing. The German national Committee for tourism (DZT) after a survey of 40 thousand tourists from around the world put the romantic brainchild of Ludwig II only in third place. And on the first - Miniatur Wunderland in Hamburg. Freud was right, regression into childhood is ubiquitous. It is naive to think that most visitors here are children. No it's adults. Maybe Eric Byrne was right with his transactional analysis, arguing that the child sits in all of us along with the adult and the parent. Or maybe we want to be a couple of hours Swift`s hero Gulliver, surveying the world around us. We want to turn on the contrary, making us big, and the world is small. On a scale of 1: 87. It costs 15 euros for adults and 7.5 for children under 15. Children up to 1 meter are free. You'll have to spend time waiting in line. You can reduce the last coming early in the morning at 9 or in the evening and on weekdays. The money spent is worth it. Of course, this is almost the price of the Louvre ( 17 EU) at a disparate scale of exposure. But on the other hand we will see the Harz mountains, the Swiss Alps, Knuffingen airport, the beauty of gingerbread Austria, Las Vegas and Scandinavia. And you don't have to go to Neuschwanstein, it's waiting for you here. Under the roof, not under the Alpine winds. Piazza San Pietro can be seen from above, as can Venice. Half of Europe in one hand.",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Not for kids only!,"There were more adults there than kids - a great place to visit! My 76 year old husband loved it. It does get crowded, so maybe go early.","Written November 29, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Outstanding day.,"Get there as soon as the place opens and stay until it closes. We booked our tickets online, which makes it quicker to enter. Lockers are provided for a returnable 1 euro deposit, its good to leave all your coats and bags there. Take your time slowly going round the exhibition as there is so much to see. We also opted for the behind the scene tour which is tour a real model fan I highly recommend you do. Lunch is a must and the food is excellent, as is the restaurant itself. There are lockers should you run out of battery for your phone, take your power bank to avoid any disappointment. This is one of best days we have had in a long time. Take your time and wear comfortable shoes. An amazing day.","Written November 28, 2019"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,The best place to visit,"We have visited this place when parents came to visit us. My daughter loves it and ask all the time to go there when somebody visits us. Last time my parent were surprised by seeing all minis by different countries. The most popular was airport where we have spend more than 30 minutes, looking how airplanes land and take off. I strongly recommend to visit it!",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Endless things to discover,"The Miniatur Wunderland is huge and every place they built is incredibly detailled. You can spend a lot of time observing each of them and discover small things and hidden surprises. You realize how much this is a work of passionate dedication to miniature building. I especially enjoyed how the whole building's lighting follows a day-night rhythm and once it grows dark you can see small street lanterns, windows and model train lights turn on - and sometimes a volcano or a fire breaks out or an alien spaceship lands. We entered the exhibition at 10:00 and left at 16:00, so it's very much an all-day activity.","Written November 17, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Loved this place,"Was really surprised how much fun I had here! It was a horribly wet day in Hamburg and seemed a decent option. I thought it was great fun, it goes dark a lot so you can see the little towns all lit up and it‚Äôs great!

It‚Äôs super cool, the kids enjoyed it and the attention to detail was amazing. The place is huge and for us the nicest touch (aside from the miniatures themselves) was the step rail that they have along a lot of the displays. It was perfect for our little 3 year old.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Tired and overcrowded,We waited longer to get in than we actually spent in the attraction! It's very overcrowded so it's difficult to get close to any of the exhibits. Whilst at first glance it is quite impressive on closer inspection it's really dusty and in a poor state of repair and much of it is just shop-bought toy vehicles (with not much regard paid to things being to a consistent scale). I'm sure kids would enjoy it but for us it felt like a waste of time and money.,"Written November 3, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,I love it and can stay at the Knuffingen Airport for hours,"I just love the Miniatur Wunderland and my godson and his brother also had a great time. Honestly I really don't know how these creators work, but the two floors of miniature cities reflect amazing handicraft and technical work. The room will keep on rotation between day and night time so you can see the lights. Just pay attention to everything because they even have small human figures inside of the ships, buildings and whatever. Knuffingen is an imagined city and the airport is just a highlight because they have planes that actually took off and landing, and they were just like real airports, where the planes parked at gates, pushed back from gates, taxied, took off and landed.

I agree that you should buy tickets online in advance. You will need to plan a bit but it will be helpful especially during holidays and weekends. However, the place can be crowded. I came during school holidays so there were crowds especially in the Germany section. Maybe you should start from the last city and worked backward, so you would go against the crowd.",

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,World class attraction,"We spent four hours, were pretty exhausted, and still left with the feeling we should have seen more.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Great Museum and unique experience,"I was a bit unsure for visiting the museum because of my two small kids ...not sure if they will enjoy it. We stayed in the museum for almost 4 hrs without any complain or getting bored. They enjoy it so much that we went again. Ofcourse expect them to be tired afterwards... which is good :)

It‚Äôs a unique experience for the whole family. You have the chance to see the making process of the miniatures and demonstrate to your kids physical phenomena or transportation means and historical events.

I recommend everyone to visit. Wear comfy shoes and take water as you will be standing quite long time.

Lastly, expect to see at least a few rude people pushing you to take a ... picture. They are usually HuGe & Tall north European Mountains that will block the view of many people... just ignore their uncivilized manners... and enjoy!!!!

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,The Biggest and Some of the Best,"If you like model railroads or just miniature modeling, this attraction is tailor made for you and/or your family. It is the largest model railroad in the world, modeling highlights from countries around the world, including Germany, Italy, the U.S., Switzerland, etc., many villages, harbors, huge train stations, ships and so much more. They‚Äôre all interconnected and span two floors with hundreds of trains, thousands of cars (many of which move), tens of thousands of figures and an enormous airport at which planes take off and land. Some of the modeling is astounding, recreating many iconic landmarks from various countries. And it‚Äôs even expanding. Definitely worth a visit at which you can spend an entire day. The private hour tour is also a good bet to see areas not easily visible from the viewing aisles and to learn how some of the wizardry works.","Written October 16, 2019"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,So much detail.,"The amount of detail in just a few inches of the pieces is amazing, the more you look the more you can see. This is a must do for anyone going to Hamburg!",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazing Hamburg highlight!,"Miniatur Wunderland is 15 years old and world famous and renowned! The miniature world is fantastic for children of all ages. The sets are amazing with the longest and largest train set in the world. I loved the buildings, stadiums and the humour in each set. Look out for the volcano, Star Wars and Ghostbusters surprises!
I loved the fact the rooms are on a 12 minute cycle from dawn to dusk.
It‚Äôs rightly so popular that they are expanding into new buildings.
I look forward to seeing Paris, London and New York plus the 7 wonders of the ancient and modern worlds! A unbelievably brilliant Hamburg highlight and I‚Äôm not a model train enthusiast. I can see why so many adore it!","Written October 10, 2019"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Mixed feelings.,"We visited Hamburg from the UK for the sole purpose of visiting wonderland. The models and layouts were simply amazing. Loads to see as there are lots of intricacies‚Äô that if you don‚Äôt look close enough you could miss. Our issues lay with the staff and rudeness of many of the visitors (not much you can do about that i know) shoving and pushing and tolerance of my son ( ASD&SLD) was negligible. Food was great but pricey however the majority of the staff were rude, lacked good manners and apart from a couple looked like they were being forced to work there. A gentleman brought a piece of fish back that was frozen and the girl snatched it back off him with out uttering a word and flung it in the fryer again. This didn‚Äôt spoil our visit however we did find the intolerance of people with disabilities was the main observation on our trip. Definitely will not be returning to this place. This is no discredit to the hard work of the people responsible for the displays, just not a place we‚Äôre we felt comfortable. We were upset about the way people reacted to our son. Such an shame.","Written October 9, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazing Experience,"I had seen a you-tube video of Miniatur Wonderland several years ago, and decided that we had to see it someday. Thankfully, we recently had the opportunity and were not disappointed. The attention to detail, and the worldly scope of their exhibits made it a fascinating experience. Many large cities are instantly recognizable, and the planes taking off, cars and trucks dodging each other, not to mention railroads circling mountains, were exceptionally realistic. They've created an amazing experience overall, enhanced when they turn out the overhead lights, and the towns come alive with their street lights, headlights, stop lights, etc., especially in their Las Vegas exhibit. Highly recommend this museum to satisfy the child in all of us.","Written October 8, 2019"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Fun Couple of Hours Enjoying Fantastic Attention to Detail,"We visited here on our Honeymoon earlier this year and had a fantastic time. We didn't book in advance and arrived mid-morning on a Friday. A welcoming receptionist greeted us in excellent English and explained there would be a wait prior to entering the main area as they staggered the starts to ensure a good flow of people. We had to wait around 30 minutes in a well lit and equipped waiting room before being able to go up to the main event.
The main attractions are fantastic, large in scale and incredibly detailed, taking hours to create. The lights, trains, vehicles and interactive parts are incredibly well crafted and can surprise as much as they can fascinate. Much of the fun comes from simply observing the sets, using your eagle eye to spot some of the (in)famous scenes and others which arent well known, but bring a smile to your face.
I wouldnt say there was a particular highlight, as each section was fantastic in it's own right, but needless to say we took more photos here than at any other point during our visit to Hamburg.
Well worth a visit and a great way to spend a few hours.","Written October 7, 2019"

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Fantastic!,"During the day that our cruise ship was docked in the port of Kiel, we were involved in a guided tour to Hamburg. This tour took us to see various attractions located around the central city area of Hamburg.
Our first stop was at the Miniatur Wunderland model railway and model airport exhibition building. On the day of our visit, there was a long queue of visitors at the ticket desk waiting to purchase admission tickets. Fortunately, because we were on a tour, we were allowed to go straight in without having to wait.
We were just blown away by the size of the various displays and the amount of detail included in the various layouts. Despite there being many visitors present, it was relatively easy to move around to view the different displays.
One thing that visitors need to be wary of is that from time to time, the building‚Äôs main interior lighting is dimmed so that the special lighting effects on the layouts can be appreciated. When this occurs it can become quite dark. In a crowded environment, this could provide an opportunistic pickpocket with the chance to strike. Consequently, visitors need to take good care of their personal valuables.
At the end of our time at the Miniatur Wunderland, we visited their well-stocked gift and souvenir shop where we managed to make a couple of purchases.
Because, we were on a tour, we were only able to stay at the Miniatur Wunderland for about ninety minutes. We would have loved to have stayed much longer as it was fantastic.
It was the highlight of our day in Hamburg!",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Amazing,"You don‚Äôt have to be a model railway enthusiast to enjoy a visit to this brilliant attraction.
The sheer scale of the model railways and surrounding scenery is amazing.
There is even a massive airport with planes taking off and landing. All ages will appreciate a visit. It was very busy but with a bit of patience you can see everything.
Give yourself at least 3 or 4 hours to see and appreciate the detail of the model towns and villages. There are replicas of famous buildings in Hamburg and Rome . While you are looking at a section of wunderland you will see vehicles moving in different directions, observing traffic signals and trains running on various tracks.
The restaurant has good choice and reasonably priced.","Written October 3, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Highlight of my trip to Hamburg!,,"Written October 3, 2019"
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Great things come in small models,"Situated inside a warehouse building at the UNESCO-listed Speicherstadt, this indoor gallery/exhibition is truly an outstanding work in progress. Tickets cost 15‚Ç¨ per adult (student discounts available), and is absolutely worth every cent, considering the level of detail and thought that has gone into every figurine and arrangement.

We went there without reservations on a late Monday morning, and although we had to wait for around 25 mins to enter, it didn‚Äôt feel long as the waiting area had a caf√© and several puzzle games to keep one busy. Inside, we were overwhelmed by the variety of model themes on display, from Italian landscapes to limestone caves. My personal favourite was the airport, where you get to see aeroplanes literally taking off and landing!

Additionally, you also get to have a sneak peek of the ongoing work that goes into creating and maintaining the displays, with craftsmen/-women at work for visitors to view. At the end, we spent nearly three hrs exploring, and could easily have stayed longer if time permitted. If you get hungry in between, there is another cafeteria inside selling full hot meals.

Overall, it was a really enjoyable visit, and it really doesn‚Äôt matter how old you are or whether you‚Äôre into miniature models ... the place has certainly got something for everyone! In any case, it's a great indoor activity for a cold, rainy day.","Written October 2, 2019"

My wife really wanted to see it, and heard good things so we decided to give it a try.

At the end of the day this is and should be among the top spots to visit when you‚Äôre in Hamburg.

The detail, scale and overall professional way the exhibits are presented is really incredible. We have visited in real life many of the areas recreated in miniature and it is amazing to see how real they look.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Absolutely outstanding,"I had heard that it was worth a visit , but nothing prepared me for just how exceptional this attraction is.
Very easy to find in the Hafencity area of Hamburg , I was surprised to find there was a 2 hour wait for entry. I asked how long we would need to go round , 2 hours came the reply.
We duly returned having purchased 2 tickets at ‚Ç¨15 each .
7 hours later we left at closing time (8pm)
There are 9 very large zones split over 2 floors , any 1 of which would be worthy of a 2 hr visit for ‚Ç¨15.
The sheer scale is mind blowing.
The level of detail is outstanding , with literally thousands of fantastic scenes. The level of imagination is unbounded. You could visit 100 times and not spot all the details.
The buildings are truly fantastic, with everything from churches , football stadia, ports, stations , temples, hotels and so so so much more
I would have been happy to have paid that for just 1 of the 9 areas.

It must be the trains, planes, ships, football matches, concerts and even dolphins. Try looking for the couple trying to be discreet. Then there's the Vatican, Swiss Alps the Americas and a erupting volcano.

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Wonderful wonderland,"What a beautiful world. Well made with a lot of little 'fun' details, such as the Ghostbusters in a small back yard. The models themselves are incredibly well made, but it's the little humourous details that make it worth while. Atlantis, Greta Thunberg on an icefloe, a dragon flying in the background etc. Even the recursion of having a model of the miniatur wonderland itself, miniature railroad visible through the miniature windows.",

Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Such an amazing experience,"We had pre-booked our tickets online which meant that we didn‚Äôt have to queue. So it was straight up the stairs and into the exhibition.

The good reviews on here are not wrong as the museum recreated miniature versions of railroads, cities and life in Germany, Europe and even America. It even includes a fully operational version of Hamburg airport. It was quite mesmerising watching the flights take off.

There is so much tiny detail in the exhibitions such as fire engines moving through the streets to respond to fires and car accidents. We even spotted a model of a dead man in a stream!

To say the wife was in her element is an understatement. She waited for ten minutes for the displays to go dark so she could press the UFO button. This triggered a UFO to fly over a display of Middle Germany.","Written September 19, 2019"

The attention to detail is mind-blowing and everything appears to run very reliably...probably a good thing they don't model Britain's railway (with the exception of Hogwarts Express which I did catch a glimpse of)!",
Germany,Miniatur Wunderland,Made you feel like a kid again!,"Went with my wife, who only really went to keep me happy. In the end I think she enjoyed it as much as I did. It is a tremendous attraction with so much to see and it makes you look for the small attention to detail that reveals funny or unusual scenes within the main dioramas. It took us 3.5 hrs to get round and you are surrounded by people who are enjoying things as much as you are, so it makes for a great atmosphere.

The kids love it but sometimes quite difficult to appreciate it with so many people vying to get a photo of the incredible displays.

I also scheduled a behind-the-scenes tour for the next day. They keep the tour sizes small (up to 6 people), so you get a very personalized experience.

The models are setup in different geographic regions, America, Scandinavia, Hamburg/Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.

Other than trains there are road vehicles (buses, trucks/etc) that drive around the roads, there are planes, and boats. There are many buttons that guests can press to activate different scenes (loggers chopping trees, lights & music at a night club, a ski-lift, emergency vehicles, etc).

There are lockers & a coat check area for items, as a well as a cafeteria with nice German foods.",

It is tastefully presented with enough art and historic information to make it an overall enjoyable experience. Definitely worth the extra money to skip the line. Except for three things. First, there was no crowd control noticeable regarding the number of people allowed in, which was overwhelming. At times there were people eight deep trying to see one painting that made if almost virtually impossible to read the details about the work. If you tried waiting for some people to move for a better look, another wave of people came in. Second, due to this sea of people, it was uncomfortably warm. Third, also due to the amount of people, you had to go to the restroom before you needed to, because there were not enough facilities.

Germany,Stadel Museum,Experience the importance of Van Gogh,"A great way to see the importance of Van Gogh. The exhibit perfectly lays out how Van Gogh was the instrumental painter in the transition from Impressionism to the modern of the 20th century. The more than 50 Van Gogh‚Äôs allow you to follow the rapid development of his technique. Next to his works you directly see Van Gogh‚Äôs influence on the development of German and European painting from the 1910s on.

One moves with great freedom in the exhibition and can see up close the work on the painting. Be sure to order tickets online and book a time slot to avoid standing in line for hours. You can download the audio guide to your handy and avoid another line and you can look at the exhibit again.","Written January 14, 2020"

Germany,Stadel Museum,Van Gogh Exhibit,Went to the see the Van Gogh exhibit- luckily we got there early. Even still it was very crowded since the exhibit was down in the basement and the rooms were tight for the all the visitors.

Lockers for your stuff. Reasonable price to enter. Overall worth the visit.,
Germany,Stadel Museum,Great Van Gogh exhibition,"Visited the museum on New Years Day. I don‚Äôt think there was too much open in the city and the museum was popular with people queuing outside for tickets. There was also a long queue for the ladies toilets.

You can‚Äôt take any bags round the museum and need to leave these in secure lockers ....you will need a ‚Ç¨1 coin for each locker (you get this back).

Entry was ‚Ç¨18 which although ‚Äòpricey‚Äô enabled me to see an incredible Van Gogh exhibition assembled from around the world. The rest of the museum contained some other wonderful art including Monet, Cezanne, Vermeer etc. All the paintings were very accessible.

The ‚Äòcafe‚Äô is closer to a formal restaurant with nice table cloths, table d‚Äôhote menu and pricing to match. There was a bit of a queue, so we didn‚Äôt go in.

The admission cost and crowds put me off a bit, but it undoubtedly has a very good art collection.","Written January 1, 2020"

Germany,Stadel Museum,"Excellent Museum with some historic Art, great curation.","The museum was founded in 1817 and has Art from the 14th century to Modern Art. There was a Tizian exhibition in May when we visited that was enjoyable and educational, it was well curated. The museum has a really excellent permanent collection. One of the most significant paintings for me was the Monet painting called 'The Luncheon' which was the painting that the jury of the Paris Salon on 1870 turned down. So Monet instead turned to Impressionism. 'The Luncheon' is a nice painting but it was the turning point to Impressionism. There are many other works of Art that are worth seeing and spending a day or at least an afternoon there is well worth it. Some good paintings of historic Frankfurt can be viewed too.",
Germany,Stadel Museum,Subpar,"After reading all of the reviews here, I was amazed at how poor the collection was.

It was not busy at all the day we went, though -- so it's not necessarily the crowds I'm talking about -- it's the shear vastness of the place.

However, when we visited, The Geographer by Johannes Vermeer was on loan at an undetermined location, and The Blinding of Samson by Rembrandt was not being exhibited. There were no works by Rubens or Van Gogh, standards in most other major European art museums.

The entry charge is justified by the quality of the collection. We were failry exhausted after going around the old masters' galleries, though happily there is a cafe (as well as a more formal restuarant). The collection of medieval paintings -- primarily German and Low Countires, including Bosch, Christus, the Flemalle master -- was superb and we fell in love with an altarpiece from a nunnery which had a Virgin at the centre and painted wings, but space presumably for relics.

I've never seen a Modern Art collection that was setup within a context. Usually, you see isolated works of art, put in place coincidentally. Not so at the Stadel! The explaining texts connect the diverse subsections with each other, the architecture seems to be around the pictures, and not the other way round. Every work of art is given enough space to breathe, and the collection has been obviously driven by some purpose, some plan.

Germany,Stadel Museum,Love it,"All in all, I loved this place. It obviously doesn't have the collection of princes and emperors as at the main museums in Munich or Vienna, but it's nonetheless strong in both highlights and breadth. Even more so, they do a lot in terms of providing a rich experience for viewers. Took me from about noon until 6pm (6 hours!) to get through the whole collection thoroughly, with a few breaks for coffee or snacks, though the galleries always felt like a pleasure.

Maybe the best wall labels I've seen at any museum on the planet? I've got a graduate degree in art history and actually learned *a lot* from the labels here!

The collection itself is solid, reflects the long history of Frankfurt as drawing primarily on its merchant class to buy Northern Ren and German old masters, with some Italians sprinkled in, along with a good collection of Die Brucke and Blaue Reiter and some nice Courbets and Nazarenes, among others. The contemporary section leans too heavily on macho posturing of 70s and 80s Neo Expressionism, so expect a lot of empty Albert Oehlen type works that go on forever.

Cafe provides good fare at a reasonable price. Ditto the bookstore (though they didn't have any affordable notebooks when I ran out!).","Written July 20, 2019"

Germany,Stadel Museum,Impressive collection but it could be better organized,"The collection is indeed impressive, covering all periods of Western painting and representing a majority of the most renown artists from Italy, Spain, France, Netherlands, Belgium, etc. The collection of renaissance Flemish painters was quite comprehensive. Contemporary painting was very well represented too. This is probably the 'go-to' place to admire the creations of E.L. Kirchner and Max Beckmann.
The Downside is the way the display is set up, with no particular order or a chronological plan: One room is Italian renaissance and the next one is XIX century English painting to move back to medieval religious paintings in the following room. Kirchner paintings also were displayed awkwardly in different locations without an apparent logic to it.

Picasso‚Äôs lithographic exhibition is good, with many intriguing prints and some colourful lino cuts.

Titian and the Venetian Renaissance is also really good although quite crowded. Lots of work by Titian himself, plus Tintoretto, Bassano, Veronese and El Greco amongst others.

The permanent collection is huge. A great selection of Impressionist work and as you‚Äôd expect, a wide range of German art.

Paula Modersohn-Becker, Lovis Corinth, Max Liebermann and Max Becker featured prominently.

The Modern Art section on the lower floors was very good too. I liked Andy Warhol‚Äôs portrayal of Goethe, as well as Gerhard Richter‚Äôs work.

Germany,Stadel Museum,Mixed feelings,"I am not an art lover, but I like to try and enjoy it hence my visit.

I wouldn‚Äôt say the arrival experience is particularly positive - a little bit stand-offish, why not just be friendly and welcoming like other sectors of the service industry.

The major exhibition was Titian - and I managed to navigate it in reverse. The signage that takes you to it takes you to the 2nd part of the exhibition on the upper level. Anyway, there were clearly some notable pieces of art here, and it was interesting enough.

The highlight for me was the room dedicated to Max Beckmann - never heard of him - but his work was really thought provoking, sadly it was only about 15 items.

The lowlight, well I took off my coat for a few minutes as it was quite warm. I was quickly reprimanded - apparently holding your coat is not permitted, it‚Äôs either worn or in the cloakroom. It would have been a fairly spectacular heist for me to get out of there with a piece of art under my coat!

So, in a nutshell, some things to enjoy, some not so enjoyable.","Written February 22, 2019"

Germany,Stadel Museum,Special exhibition Vasarely,"We visited the museum in the last days of showing the temporary Vasarely exhibition, so it was a 15-minutes waiting to get in, but it was worth to see his works in their original size, and it was more exciting for a teenager than the old masters.
After this we went through the rooms of the modern painters¬¥s section as well.
Certainly you can¬¥t compare this museum¬¥s collections to the bigger ones, but I think there¬¥re many interesting objects which are not so well-known, and many by German painters too (which shouldn¬¥t be a surprise).

Loved the ‚Äòbacks of paintings‚Äô section, something really different!

One of the good galleries that lets you take photos :)

Apparently there‚Äôs a sculpture garden, we never saw any signs to it and missed it completely.

I also know that they hold major exhibitions here as, for example, they recently hosted one focussing on Raphael. I particularly enjoyed the feeling of space as this is a good-sized Museum which was extended below ground in 2012 to house the modern Art they hold . There are also interesting gardens around the Museum which are worth a look as they contain many sculptures & installations, plus the skylight dome which lights the new extension.",
Germany,Stadel Museum,Spending some time with Rubens & friends-Fabulous!,"Accidentally wandered into Frankfurt's Museum sector as a first time visitor to discover the Rubens exhibition from enormous enticing placards set out front. As lovers of Arts, history and #culturebuffs it wasn't that hard!

Drawn by the grandeur of the buildings facade and excited by what it held we eagerly signed up once inside for the Rubens exhibition being held. Included in the price were Audioguides for an extra fee but well worth the ‚Ç¨7 to hear the in-depth description of each of the works.

Some photography was permitted with signs clearly showing that as well as a detailed description of the works magnificently curated.

Covering many rooms the exhibition also included other masters and more lesser known works from artists from Renaissance and other highlighted periods in history.

There's plenty of seating inside the exhibition to take in the works or discuss in the cafe over a glass of wine and delicious snacks and meals. Time didn't permit this as we spent so much time in the exhibition!

Allow at least 3 hours but preferably a day to sample the full gamut at leisure or even more!
Very enjoyable memories to take back to Australia!",

Germany,Stadel Museum,Go go go to Frankfurt' best museum!,"I visited four museums in Frankfurt, and this was by far the best one. You will see Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Rembrandt, and right now (April 2018) a special Rubens exhibit. There is a very unusual display of the backs of paintings. It explains how experts can tell how the painting was mounted, see various markings made by the artist, and learn more about the material on which the work was painted. This all helps provide provenance. Interesting and unexpected.

Allow 2 hours for a thorough visit. I paid for the audio guide, but then learned that there is an app you can download and listen on your phone. I wish the cashier had mentioned that.

One caveat: This was the noisiest art museum I have ever visited. There were some school groups which created much of the cacophony, as they can do. What I did not understand was that no one tried to address this and ask them to be respectful. Also, you will be asked to put your backback or other large bag in a locker (1 euro). If you carry a jacket, they insist you wear it or tie the arms around your waist.

All this aside, the art collection here is outstanding. Add this to your Frankfurt list!",

The collection offers a complete survey of seven hundred years of European art from the early fourteenth century to the present.

There are three permanent exhibitions: Old Masters 1300-1800, Modern Art 1800-1945 and Contemporary Art 1945-. This spring the museum has also a Rubens exhibition. So there are many kinds of art on display.",
Germany,Stadel Museum,Rubens and not only!,"Don't miss the chance to visit this amazing museum during your stay in Frankfurt. Located on the South Bank of the river Main, not so far from Romerberg and its old square, the St√§del Museum is not only hosting this stunning comprehensive Rubens's exhibit, dramatically called ""The Power of Transformation"", but it also boasts a good number of worldwide renowned masterpieces of famous artists. Rubens's special exhibition features about 120 among the huge paintings and drawings of the Flemish talented artist, whose voluptuous women and pastoral or mythological settings, housed in this remarkable single show, will leave you open-mouthed!
The admission fee to the whole museum is not expensive, also given the uniqueness of the Rubens's event: only ‚Ç¨ 16,00 at weekends for each single adult, and with only 4 more euros, you'll be supplied with the audio-device, a very practical way to be guided not only through Rubens's exhibit, but also throughout the whole premises and their wonderful collections, which include impressive works of art by such talents as Vermeer, Botticelli, Mantegna, Verrocchio, Van Eyck and his amazing ""The Lucca Madonna"", Bosch, Guercino, Renoir, Munch. When you get out of the building, after spending such a meaningful and magical time, you'll find the walk along the river Main a really relaxing and enjoyable moment. Have a good stay!",

A lot of nice pieces showing the interrelation of northern and southern Renaissance art and the influence of both in Germany. The collection of Max Beckmann's work was a highlight for me, especially since some of it had Frankfurt as its subject. The contemporary art downstairs was worth visiting for the space alone.

Germany,Stadel Museum,Matisse - Bonnard Exhibition / 5-Stars!,"I had an opportunity to see this museum's outstanding permanent collection on my last visit to Frankfurt. On this visit, I came to see ""Matisse - Bonnard"" a major exhibition featuring a large number of works by French artists Henri Matisse and Pierre Bonnard. The exhibition was an opportunity to see works of two important artists, who not only shared a forty year friendship, but a like for the same subject matter, side-by-side. With the works arranged by categories that included landscapes, still lifes, interiors and nudes, it was a rare opportunity to see how two talented artists approached similar subject matter. The results were impressive.

This was my first time seeing so many Bonnard paintings together at one time, providing more appreciation for his talent. This well staged exhibition by the Staedel, was one of my favorite exhibitions of 2017. No photos were allowed in the exhibition.

As mentioned earlier, the Staedel has a fine permanent collection that's not to be missed. They also have a nice gift shop and restaurant. The Staedel is located along Frankfurt's famous museum row.",
Germany,Stadel Museum,worth a visit,"coat check is free, entrance tickets can be bought at the door, there is a cafe onsite.

Germany,Stadel Museum,Seriously impressive,"Having visited most of the major art museums in Germany, I would say the Stadel is the best of those that cover the whole history of art (slightly ahead of the Hamburg Kunsthalle). The Matisse/Bonnard exhibition was brilliantly curated with the most enthralling audio guide. I went in not being a big fan of Matisse and came out appreciating him a little better. But Bonnard was the real eye-opener with his dazzling colours and mysterious ghostly presences. The permanent collection is superb. A particularly fine collection of Kirchner and Beckmann paintings but most of the big names are represented with major works, aside curiously from the pioneers of abstract art. The museum is generous with loans so some of its iconic works were not on show but enough were. The audioguide for the permanent collection was fantastic with an unusually large number of works covered unlike in some more august institutions. There was a 30min entry queue which was probably due to Matisse. If there is a big exhibition it is worth buying online and waltzing straight in. The cafe in the bookshop also had a long queue. There is also a pricey restaurant, which was pretty empty. I think the museum could reorganise to give the cafe more space and reduce the queue. Overall, simply superb.","Written January 8, 2018"

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Largest Northern European Gothic Church,"This amazing, immense cathedral is definitely something to see. The exterior is made from Sandstone that is blackened from the weather and it took 632 years from the start of construction to when it was eventually finished, with wars and bombings in between. Easily seen from the Rhine River it is a UNESCO World Heritage Sight. When we were there there was a lot of scaffolding around the building as they were cleaning the sandstone, a massive job. It is situated close to the railway station, beware of scams and pick pockets in the area. Our guide told us that people are distracted by the chalk art work on the ground and then get their wallets stolen. The interior is amazing, if you're fit enough then going to the top platform via the 533 steps is worth it. It was a slow walk up as there were so many people doing it, but the views were great.",

The outside, which is made of sandstone, has a gothic, grayish hue. However, when the sun hits it, the slight display of a pinkish/tan can be observed. Inside, the stained glass and floor are just breathtaking. Be sure to take your time and look at the intricacies of the floor. We were consumed with it. If you are physically able, be sure to walk up the cathedral. With over 500 winding steps that are not for anyone that struggles to walk, the panoramic view from the top is well worth the trek.

I would also recommend walking down to the bars and restaurants along the water. Cologne was a city we will be sure to visit again!",

It‚Äôs an absolute must to see the inside as well as the outside. If you have the stamina and energy you should take the 500+ steps to go to the very top. Keep in mind it gets very narrow at the very top of it. The steps are steep and extremely narrow and small.

During the war this was used as the focal point to bomb the city. Which is why only one corner of the cathedral was ever damaged, friendly bombing.

The majority of the cathedral has stayed intact from the time it was built. Each spire is generally being kept in maintenance here and there.

It‚Äôs quite an edifice and are inspiring for the architects of the world.",

The architecture itself is a bit of a mish mash in the sense that there are clear differences in the style as your eye travels up the building. Apparently this is due to the length of time it took to build and the different parties it involved. The interior is quite grand, although very chilly so make sure to bring a coat! The bones of the Three Wise Men are said to be kept here, which seems to be it's claim to fame, although Napoleon is said to have used it to stable his horses at one point which I thought was much more interesting. It's definitely worth a visit, especially as it's free. An added and humorous bonus is the Roman wall and well which can be found in the parking lot just below the Cathedral which the owner did not deem important enough to stop construction for, so instead just built around.",

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,One of the Greatest World Man-Made Wonders,"This Catholic church was finished in 1880, after 632 years of construction work and it is nowadays one of the most significant pilgrimage places in Europe, due to its historical significance and priceless relics kept inside. Apparently. the sandstone covering the building walls reacts with the acid rain, turning a dark grey, and giving the edifice its blackish colour, in spite of renovations over time.
There are a multitude of areas not to be missed, once you enter the cathedral. Probably the most memorable is the South tower, accessible by elevator, otherwise by foot, if you dare the challenge to climb its 533 steps. From the top platform , you have an impressive view over the city, from a height of approximately 100 m. At the ground level, you need to wander through the large expanse of the naves, under the 43 m high arches ceiling, in order to see the main and two side naves, in detail. The decorations are exquisite. Then there are the choir ambulatory, the Shrine of the Three Kings behind the altar, and a few various chapels. Also, underground, accessible for and extra fee and by elevator, there is a treasury - where no taking pictures is allowed, holding holy relics, liturgical items, and works of art in precious metals and stones, some dating from the 4th century.",

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,just wonderful,"We stepped out of the station and there it was, right in front of us. Amazing and fascinating in its looming medieval glory. We had come, from Holland, just to see this.

It was the facade that made the first and abiding impression. Dark, but oh so detailed. We looked up, studying the details. Delighted by the life-like statues, the proportion and balance. We looked again and again. Wanted to step back some more to get a better perspective, but there was a busy traffic intersection. Not safe to walk into it looking at the cathedral. From the other side of the intersection, the view was blocked by large tour buses.

We walked around the back of the cathedral, had to to get to our hotel. We approached it from the south side, where much of the view was taken up by a concrete and glass museum that wasn't open. We marveled for a long time at the facade. We went inside.

Inside was just as balanced and detailed outside. The whole made a kind of sense, but the details were from different centuries and in different styles. Making sense and bringing pleasure along with the sense of history and reverence, but not quite fitting together as the facade did.

Not too noisy inside. Still room and time for meditation and worship.

We left, looking back on this hunk of architecture dumped into the city by history. Extremely imposing. You just have to design your city centre around it.

At night, from the hotel, we had a superb view of the floodlit clock tower. Unforgettable.","Written December 10, 2019"

The site of Cologne Cathedral has been occupied by Christian churches since about the 4th century. An older cathedral was destroyed by fire in 1248, and immediately thereafter work began on the present cathedral, which was designed in the Gothic style in emulation of French church architecture. The choir was consecrated in 1322, but construction continued until 1560 (or only until 1520, according to some authorities). The architects Ernst Friedrich Zwirner and Richard Voigtel carried out the enterprise, guided by architectural drawings made in about 1300. Construction finally ended in 1880.","Written November 23, 2019"

The Dom is literally outside the K√∂ln Hauptbahnhof, so it is very easy to get to. We spent about 2 hours looking at the Dom and taking photos. Even if you aren‚Äôt religious, this is a very tranquil place.","Written November 18, 2019"

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Most beautiful place in the world....as well as the best town ANYWHERE,"The Dom is THE place to visit. Koln is soo much more too but this place is like home to me. For past 10 years we have come twice a year, every year during the Christmas Markets and there is no other place better.

If you want to go up in the tower go at opening. No one else is really there yet and you can just walk up without having to worry about anyone coming down at same time. Just sit inside and connect with the Dom....its amazing.

Stop by Gaffel and have dinner. Where else can you have amazing Kolsch, great food, then walk out to the Dom and the markets....simply heaven.","Written November 15, 2019"
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Worth the visit,"It‚Äôs free inside the church and definitely worth seeing. Internally very rich in history and art. Externally an amazing sight to behold.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Spectacular cathedral and lovely landmark at night,"The cathedral dominates Cologne and doesn't disappoint with a visit - walking around the exterior is amazing in its architectural detail then the inside is simply a ""Wow"" moment. Intricate construction from stonework to glasswork to mosaic. Amazing textures in the stonework. But nothing takes away from the obvious palpable religious significance, the altars, candles and flowers and the many people in prayer paying their respects. Awesome and I'd go out of my way to return.","Written November 14, 2019"
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Even in Rain--don't miss this,"We had rain during much of our trip to Germany, but put your coat on and keep moving. The Cathedral had a very gothic look due to the rain.

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,"Spectacular exterior, free entry","A stunning exterior with a far more sober interior, the cathedral is still worth checking out inside. It‚Äôs free entry but a guided tour is ‚Ç¨8. I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed in the tour as I wanted to hear a lot more on different sculpture and monument features in the cathedral rather than a broad overview of Gothic architecture (which I know a lot about already). Also the day I did the tour the choir was closed for confessions; why wasn‚Äôt this noted prior to tour booking?! Still seeing the Three Wise men relic is worth it.",
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Spectacular,This cathedral really does take your breath away and I‚Äôm not one for site seeing. Every time you look at it you notice something different. We also completed the climb of the cathedral and the view from the top is amazing. Staircase up is very crowded and if you don‚Äôt like heights it can get a bit scary near the top when the last stairs are open. Brilliant day,"Written November 12, 2019"
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,WOW,What a spectacular cathedral. Busy all the time so have some patience if you want the perfect picture.,"Written November 12, 2019"
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Amazing,The Cologne cathedral is the largest Gothic church in Northern Europe and has the second-tallest spires. The towers for its two huge spires give the cathedral the largest fa√ßade of any church in the world and what is the most interesting- during 4 years in the past it was the tallest building in whole world.,
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Stunning exterior,"I had my first view of this famous cathedral as we arrived on our Rhine Cruise, it was simply stunning. It is only a short walk from the river or the station and wherever you go in Cologne it dominates the skyline.

Some say it looks dirty, but I think the colour is part of its charm. It is amazing that it survived the bombing in World War II when so much didn‚Äôt. Our guide told us that navigators used the two towers as a navigation aid - don‚Äôt know if this is true.

The interior was nice but not spectacular, for me it is the gothic exterior that is so special. You can, for a small fee, climb 533 stone steps to a viewing platform for some special views.",

The views of the city were amazing. We also got to see the bells and towers up close. The walk up the spiral steps can be challenging. It's narrow and is the only way up and down. It can be a bit tight with people coming from both directions. Entry fee is 5 Euro. There is a rest room on the ground floor, .50 EU to access.","Written November 7, 2019"

Germany,Cologne Cathedral,A magnificent cathedral,"The cathedral has been standing here for centuries now and that was pretty obvious considering the top walls and spires all turned black from soot deposits. Only some parts of it could retain the original colour. The backside of the building was being renovated. It‚Äôs magnificent to look at though, and very big in size. We weren‚Äôt aware of the modest dressing norm here and so my wife had to cover up her shoulders with a scarf they provided. Once inside the cathedral the beauty was unmatched. It was a gothic masterpiece. We were lucky enough that a prayer had started when we entered and we did witness the ceremony. I totally loved it !!",
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Worth visiting,"Cologne Cathedral is massive and imposing, but its exterior is very dark and dirty (caused by soot from the nearby train station). It is certainly worth visiting (free admission), but not as impressive as I had imagined. The stained glass windows inside are beautiful, but the cathedral doesn't have the same warmth as other notable cathedrals I have visited. Luckily there weren't hordes of tourists the day we visited, and no service was being performed. Our excellent Viking tour guide provided lots of interesting, detailed information.","Written November 3, 2019"
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Most Beautiful Cathedral,This Cathedral is amazing. Its huge big and looks beautiful. Inside there is many to see. And the best thing is its free entrance you pay only for treasure room. Inside you can feel the history.,
Germany,Cologne Cathedral,Spectacular cathedral,"Honestly the major reason we came to Cologne was to visit the cathedral. It was right across the street from the hotel which was very advantageous since it was lit up at night and its nice just to walk there and head back. The inside of the church is awe inspiring and a classic Gothic church. Since we were traveling away from the summer mayhem, it did not feel crowded at all. Don't forget to also look down since the mosaic floor is also and incredible work of art. The stained glass windows are to die for.
You also have to climb to the top. The entrance is just to the right of the church and outside the church. We did not see the sign initially and enjoyed walking around the church. You actually go down the stairs. If you keep going straight there is a bathroom. When you turn left at the bottom of the stairs you will quickly see where to start. There is a small gift shop as well. There is a 8 euro charge to climb and also see the treasury later which is cheaper than going to the doctor for a treadmill stress test. 533 steps later you are at the top. It was 60 degrees which made it so much easier. It would be far more difficult during the summer. We always carry a couple of bottles of water which for obvious reasons get lighter as we climb. Minimize what you carry to avoid extra torture. There was a couple in front of us and behind us which was nice since none of us were in a rush. I just can't imagine what the crowds must be like during the summer.
The view is spectacular and absolutely worth the climb. Felt absolutely safe up there though those with acrophobia may not feel the same way. If you want the full experience you have to climb to the top. There is also a crush penny machine at the top if you want a souvenier. Enjoy.","Written November 2, 2019"

No info on where Mercedes will bring us, the people that went after the founders, the major new innovations (the last one was about safety from 43 years ago), where Mercedes is produced, the current range, or why the fusion with Chrysler happened and then failed.

It is absolutely worth visiting if you're in the area, but it could be so much more.

Once we checked in for tickets, we were also provided with headset and a small device where we can tap anywhere to learn more about the history for self-tour. There are many floors, each floor giving you a different theme and experience of a different timeline of Mercedes.

There is a gift shop worth exploring however, quite pricey in my opinion!",

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,"Cars, history, multi-media in stunning architecture","The museum traces the history of the car from their inventors Benz and Daimler to concept cars of the future with amazing cars (many originals, some re-built), parts, displays and movies. You get a free audio-guide (German or English) and can move at your own pace and take in as much or as little as you want. You take an elevator to level 8 and take a spiraling way down through different eras. All is accompanied by displays covering world events and respective sound (i.e. clopping horses at the beginning or Rock ‚Äòn Roll in the 50s). Side galleries cover trucks, people transport, vehicles owned by famous people (including Lady Di and the pope) and temporary exhibits (I went to see the one celebrating 40 years G-Wagen). There‚Äôs a deli on the ground floor which you can also access to take a break and then re-enter the exhibition area with your ticket. The shop is accessible without entering the exhibition (no ticket required). The museum‚Äôs parking garage was full when I arrived, but right next to it there was another garage.
Local Covid-19 regulations mean wearing a mask is mandatory and contact details have to be filled in. There were automatic hand sanitizers all throughout the building and people mostly watched their distance. There are also museum guards on each level. A nice surprise was that when returning the audio guide you get to keep the branded lanyard (which usually would be sold...). I spent 2.5 hours and wouldn‚Äôt mind going again with visiting family or friends.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Feels like an extended sales tour,"The museum is based in an amazing building and attempts to discribe Mercedes history with European history.

However, it fails to really discribe clearly any of the engineering advances Mercedes have made. It also fails to really create an engaging narrative around the politics and history which Mercedes was affected by or helped effect. The first rooms jump back from the new engines to explaining how great were the dramatis personae and it all seemed disjointed.

The later rooms feels like a collection of the sales catalogues and that the rooms were compiled by public relation professionals rather than educators. After being in the vehicles dedicated to public service I was quite board of the museum

For all the money spent on this palace very little time was investing how to create some engaging narratives which Mercedes developed through

You start by taking an elevator to the top floor, and then walking down a gradual spiral to the ground floor, seeing all the displays arranged in chronological order, from the very first automobiles by Daimler and Benz, including the early engines, designed by Maybach. This is truly the beginnings of the gasoline powered automobile, and the history is well described on each display item in both German and English. If you're a car nut like me, you'll be thrilled by the tour, but even if you're not an avid car enthusiast, there's something about the history and development of the automobile, from the early primitive days, to the modern concept cars of the future that will appeal to almost everyone. And the displays are set in the context of world events of the times, including the company's role in production of military engines and vehicles for the Germans during WW2. There are also some interactive hands-on displays that are really interesting...I loved the one where you can hand crank a supercharger to see how it increased engine horsepower.

For starters, the architecture of the museum itself is incredible. I am sure you could take a tour just covering the architecture of the building. It is truly beautiful.

But the cars inside the museum are even more beautiful. The collection is fantastic and extensive.

We took an English language tour and it was well worth it. Our guide was a long-time Mercedes employee, who is married to one of the top Mercedes executives. His knowledge of the brand was garnered through a storied career at the company. I guess he just likes giving the tours for fun.

The tour itself starts at the beginning, the 19th Century that is. Mercedes-Benz has such a long history in the development of the automobile and the museum has cars, motors, and artifacts from every aspect of the continuing evolution. The tour gives a great overview of this history, but you could literary go back and spend all day looking at each car and reading about their history. There is some much to learn.

There is also a nice, if pricey, gift shop where you can find all things Mercedes.

A thrilling day at the museum.",
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,"Amazing experience, great museum...","We took two tickets for 20 eur. Yoy are passing floor by floor filled by mercedes exponats from beggining of their existence. I saw the BMW museum in Munchen, but this one is better from my point of view.",
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Time travel with Mercedes,"Excellent. Its a must even if you are not a big fan of Mercedes Benz. Need to spend 120-180 mins at least. Loads to see, it‚Äôs like time travel from 1886 to the future.",
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,A must for anyone that ever travelled in a car,"This was the highlight of our visit to Stuttgart. I will be back as the 3 hours we had available for this visit, was not nearly enough.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Very informative place,"Along with the beautiful Mercedes cars and other vehicles you will get good info about innovation, but of history. Keep good amount of time to explore this place",
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Loved it!!,"Excellent museum that showcases the history of Mercedes Benz starting from 1880s. Plenty of vehicles/parts of all ages on display. It will require at least one day to really enjoy the museum if you are a real car crazy person. They have restaurants also(didn't try that option). Audio guides are available at the beginning of tour.Lockers are also available to keep your stuff/bags.
Even though we reached around 4:45 pm(ticket sale closing time is 5 pm), it was very crowded. So, initially they told that we can't get in. My 6 yr old son was almost heart broken as he came to Germany just to visit this museum. Still we waited along with many other people. Luckily, they reopened the gates with tickets on half price. My son was super happy and that made his day :-)..Thanks a ton to the officials for that kind gesture.","Written January 9, 2020"
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Sensational experience,I had wanted to go for at least last 2 years but been busy. Finally I took the time to go. It was a great and so much better than I thought it would be. The whole history of the motor car. How it evolved right up to modern day cars. Fantastic place and good for families. Informative with mobile devices to explain everything you see. I will be going again for sure. ‚Ç¨10 for adult. Cafe on ground floor etc. Polite and helpful staff. It has to be the best collection of Mercedes in the world.,
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Excellent - history of the car and much more,Loved this museum - a quirky concrete building yet well laid out. From the first engine and car onwards. Loved celebrity cars and the audio-visual was good. My only niggle was not knowing whether to go left or right when moving between floors. Berthas restaurant is to be recommended too.,
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Excellent museum,"It's not necessarily to be a super big fan of automobiles to enjoy visiting this remarkable museum. First it's the architecture of the building itself that deserves to be seen and experienced. Then comes the organization of the whole visit, in which you don't have to to anything to get the audio guide telling you what you need to hear in the location you are at the moment. It even scans some codes on the floor to tell you details about certain exhibits. The car collection actually shows the whole history of automobiles, part of which Mercedes has been from the very beginning.","Written December 31, 2019"
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,History Lesson,"What a great place to learn about the history of one of the most famous brands in the automobile industry!!! Kids old and young will come to appreciate the place and the history behind it.

The entire place is huge and covers a vast number of floors each with a theme. My particular favourite was the section where they showcased some of the cars that were owned by celebrities or important people of our time. The entire place can easily take up 2 or more hours of your time depending on what interests you. Each visitor is provided with an audio guide and you activate it by aiming the device at exhibits that interest you.

Remember not to throw away your ticket as it gives you a 10% discount should you decide to visit the Porsche museum on the other side of town. At the same time, consider having a meal at Bertha's located at the basement which is another experience on its own.","Written December 31, 2019"
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Great lay out,"We visited on what we believe to be the busiest day in history! We queued for an hour & a half!
It was worth the wait though, some fabulous cars to be seen. The building is beautiful and it‚Äôs laid out very well. My only gripe would be being charged ‚Ç¨2.95 for a small bottle of water then told you can‚Äôt take it into the museum with you, drink it or throw it away. It was very hot in there so not ideal.",
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Interesting museum,Had quite a fun time here. Didn't enjoy car much but I like the history bit. But it is still interesting to look at all available Mercedes models especially the classic ones,
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Excellent museum,"The quality generally associated with Mercedes Benz products is reflected in this state of the art, modern, museum. I am a particular fan of early history, and the first part of the exhibit which showed the development of the very first automobiles by Benz and Daimler was captivating. Everything about this museum in terms of information provided (in both English and German) was very well thought out, including important events over the past three centuries. The curators are to be commended for including Mercedes-Benz's complicity in the atrocities of World War II . Obviously a museum for car buffs, I still believe that non-car lovers would find this a worthwhile experience. Some of the fully restored examples of cars from the 30s were just exceptional in terms of their beautiful lines.","Written December 19, 2019"

While they tried to take you through the full journey of their story there were just tons of cars and text and long stair cases they kept taking down through time but it didn't have any thing that was interactive like the Porsche museum had. It was very informative but kinda boring... only cool part was the none main exhibit which showed other Mercedes-Benz items that celebrities/emergency service/buses used that one was slightly interactive to at least still be memorable now.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Comprehensive Retrospective,The museum is set up similar to the Guggenheim. One takes the elevator to the top where the earliest cars are kept. Walking down the spiral walkway the cars get newer. It appears that they have nearly every Mercedes ever made. The cars all look like they just came off the showroom floor. They are beautiful. I learned a lot about the history of the company.,

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,More than amazing,"Till you actually get there it‚Äôs difficult to imagine the magnitude of this museum.
It‚Äôs simply fantastic, beautiful and for a very affordable price. Love cars, go there.",
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Only for car enthusiasts,"Seeing that the Mercedes-Benz Museum is the #1 rated attraction on TripAdvisor and with so many posts saying that it's a must-see even if you're not a car enthusiast, I decided to visit.

My thoughts:
- Incredible building. The architecture is what I enjoyed most about the entire visit. You start the tour by taking an elevator to the top, and then basically wind down around the building until you reach the bottom.
- Along the walking path, there are a lot of photo displays of important historical, scientific, pop-culture events that have nothing to do with Mercedes-Benz, but they provides some context to what else was going on in the world through the history of Mercedez-Benz. This was more interesting to me than the vehicles.
- There are plenty of vehicles to look at, as would be expected. But as a non-car enthusiast, I found I only wanted to see a sampling of each on each floor, as I wasn't all that interested in seeing every single one.
- This is a big museum. I rushed through it in about 90 minutes, because I had an appointment to make later that day. Would probably take closer to 3-4 hours if you saw everything.
- I would imagine if my kids were with me - they would find it pretty boring. I wouldn't recommend for young kids. The only thing that might have been cool is the racing simulators.

Overall, for a car or Mercedes-Benz enthusiast, this would most definitely be a 5 star attraction. But as a non-car entusiast, I thought it was OK for 10 Euros, but didn't find it all that engaging.",
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Informative and excellent car collection,"Had a few hours to kill on arrival to Stuttgart so decided to explore the museum. It was mid week, there was no crowds no queuing, was very easy to take photo. The exhibits are mainly touchable you really do get close.
Price is reasonable. There are a few cafes which again I was impressed with prices and a souvenir shop.",
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Rare glimpse of some of the most beautiful and historically important vehicles ever made.,"OK. Easy to find from the S bahn. Walk is about 750 metres, nicely signposted. Impressive purpose built building. Start at the top via a lift and wander down. Notv sure about the overtly politically correct history lining the walls. But I was there to see truly classic vehicles. I was not dissappointed. Each one beautifully restored or preserved. Have a look at the classics for sale before you leave. If you have ‚Ç¨95K you can get a 1980s 300SL! Prices went up to ‚Ç¨450K ü§§ All in all, well worth the ‚Ç¨10 entrance fee.",

The history of Mercedes Benz was as impressive and beautifully presented as the building. But it was not only the history of Mercedes Benz but a great presentation of German and partial World history since the first Mercedes and Benz inventions to today in an inventive way. All was presented in German and English. A great instrument for educating adults and children on contemporary history and its relationship to the Mercedes Benz brand. It is worth a visit if you are in Germany. Parking was a little difficult for being a Tuesday, but all worth it!","Written October 30, 2019"
Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,"Nice building, nice cars, but audio guide not intuitive","We visited the museum 25th October in the afternoon. Unfortunately, there was a large event in the evening (Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the year 2019).
Due to this event, a large part of the lower floor was closed.
There was a lot of pressure to get everybody out at 18h00.

There were no general open guided tours this day due to ""capacity issues"". Only a special G-series tour was available.

The building is architecturally very impressive, but I do recommend to get a guided tour if possible. I think it's much more efficient then the free audio guide.

The free audio guide becomes uncomfortable for wearing after several hours. And it's not really a guide, but a kind of media player you can use to get spoken info at many points in the museum.
There are Wifi icons almost everywhere, where you have to point the guide device to the icon to get info. Unfortunately, there are more points then I liked where nothing happend.
Usage is not really intuitive (and I'm an IT specialist).
Audio often didn't start immediately, you had to restart the guide a second time to get audio.

Wheelchair accessibility is good, but the viewpoints in between the different floors have high railings. If you can't stand, you can't see very much at these overview points.

There are many unique cars in excellent condition in the museum, some more interesting then others.","Written October 28, 2019"

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Well worth a visit. Best car museum in Germany,"Being that there are so many car museums in Germany, you probably want to either prioritize which ones to see or just want to know which are the best. We did them all on our trip and for sure the Mercedes Benz museum was the best. It was the largest one, most interesting, all information in English, best tour guides, and imo best German car there is ;) beautiful building built across the street from VFB Stuttgart‚Äôs arena and training facilities, if you‚Äôre into football. I‚Äôd 100% recommend doing a guided tour since they give you more information and show you the highlights. If not, you could literally spend all day in there reading everything but I think the tour is the best use of your time as a tourist. Our guide took us through Daimler Benz history as separate car producers and then the ultimate merger later on. On display are the first engines ever invented, cars, trucks, vans, trains, boats, you name it and they‚Äôve got it. As you work your way down from the top, you gradually become more modern and that was for me the coolest part. Being able to compare their original models to the relatively new ones, then going to the basement to the brand new car dealership with all of their brand new cars. Parking is pretty easy to come by, either underground in the museum or on the street outside where it‚Äôs free. We liked this museum much better than BMW and Porsche but I guess it depends on which brand you like best",

Even if you just want to learn about cars and history, or just see how magnificent a museum can be, visit here. It is accessible on public transport from the main part of the city. Inside is a multi-story extravaganza of cars and history. Besides the beautiful, shiny cars (with each car's story in both German and in perfect English - no rough translations here!) there are historical tie-ins so you can learn what was happening in the world while the engines and cars were being invented and further developed.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Educational and Interactive,"This museum is very interactive compared to most museums. I really enjoyed the way the museum was designed in order to easily guide your way through the museum. When you first start your way into the museum, you are given a device similarly alike to an iPhone and earphone headset with a complimentary Mercedes Benz neck strap. On your device you simply choose your language and click start, you immediately start to hear an auditory introduction to your auditory tour. (No tour guide needed) You start at the top floor, with the historical/older models at first and as you go to the bottom floor you reach the most up to date models. Almost every car or gadget accessory will have a wifi symbol towards the description of each piece, if you see the symbol simply point your device to the signal, once you hear a vibration you will get 3-4 options you can choose from, of descriptive audio information relating to that specific model. I found this very helpful and great because you may learn at your own pace. Depending on how much information you would like to hear you can spend an average of 3-8 hours here.

There is also a souvenir shop, and cafe area at the end of the tour, along with a dealership - Maybach located on the top floor. If you go towards the back of the top floor dealership, there is an area interactive area where you can click on each model to hear what their start up engines sound like.",

This is a beautiful well designed building that showcases not only the journey of Daimler and Mercedes-Benz over the years, but the history of the evolution of the automobile in relation to the history of the times in Europe and the world. The scope of the company in and around Stuttgart is mind boggling and I was lucky enough to do a tour of their factory at Sindelfingen as well.

Germany,Mercedes-Benz Museum,Must see museum for all ages,"This is more than an homage to the Daimler-Benz and Mercedes marques, it is a history of the development of the motor car and its place in the social history of Germany and to some respects Europe. The exhibition is over 7 floors accessible by a spiral walkway and lifts. So perfect for push chairs and wheel chairs. The audio guide is included in the price. This has quite a few languages and automatically explains the theme if a floor when you enter it. Thereafter you point it at a display board and get specific information. I particularly liked that you could hear General, Technkgical and Social and Childrens information by choice. The cares are immaculate with plenty of room to walk around and photograph without people being in the way for long. There are great 10 minute documentaries most floors with well selected archive film to explain the period of history covered by the floor. And of course the cars, vans and buses are to die for. There are 2 cafes, one on the ground floor and one on the first floor. They seem quite small for the number of people who visit, but the food was fresh and well presented. Mainly cake and filled rolls.
There is a small shop with well designed but overpriced branded merchandise. Plenty of parking next door but very expensive. There is some deal to get your first hour free which we missed so paid ‚Ç¨7 for 4.5 hours. In that time we didnt get through all the floors. Highly recommended, especially on a wet day.","Written October 3, 2019"

You take a fascinating time journey from the origins of the earliest designs by Carl Benz & Gottlieb Daimler, move on to the Silver Arrows of the 1950s, the F1 car, & finish with a glimpse into the future; all are represented in some way.

The free audio tour guide raises your experience with information, original recordings & interesting stories.

Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,Nice location but a strange way to run a business...,"My son and I are involved in the classic cars business in the UK and went to take a look at Classic Remise as we were in Dusseldorf. Lovely retail location but they let you wander around like its a museum.
A 308GTB caught our eye because it was an early, 'tall tyre' possibly vetroresina example and one of our customers was looking for one for his collection. As we were standing there an irate Gentleman comes out of a door marked 'Movendi' and starts shouting at the top of his voice in German. We look around (as does everyone) and it turns out he is shouting at my son on the other side of the car, who replied with ""I beg your pardon?!"" and shouty guy converts to English and shouts ""Yes you, don't touch the cars, don't open the cars!!!"" Now, my son is 27 years old, has several full restorations under his belt and has had his vehicles exhibited at a national level, he knows how to treat them and I was standing there with him, he didn't touch them let alone try to open the doors without asking. When he replied that he hadn't done anything Mr Shouty states ""YES YOU DID, I KNOW YOU!!!"". Quite bizarre as we'd never been there before. My son was concerned about the misunderstanding and went over to the office where Mr Shouty had retreated but he was now on the phone, maybe shouting at someone else. My son apologised to the other (polite) gentleman there that clearly they'd been a misunderstanding.

Shame, it's a nice venue but that's a strange way to run a business. If you don't like people getting near the cars probably best to lock them in a warehouse.

Despite hanging around for a bit Mr Shouty didn't come out so we couldn't set the record straight. Needless to say, we didn't buy the 308 either.","Written February 19, 2020"

Outside there is also seating, with food and bar. We enjoyed a couple of Alt beers in the sunshine. We could not believe that it is free entry here - I am sure that would not happen in the UK.

From the moment you enter the car park you are in awe of the historic building that used to be a old train winding that could house up to 30 locomotives for storage and repair.
Walking into the building you pass the Ducati garage where the mechanics are working on bikes in all sorts of repair and will happily talk to you about what they are doing. Seeing some of the exotic machines in various states of repair gives you a good sense of what exactly goes into these.
Inside the there are cars everywhere. I made it very clear to my young family that this was a ‚Äúlook and don‚Äôt touch‚Äù place which they ably stuck too.
There‚Äôs so much to see here that you need at least 90 minutes to view everything, stop in the restaurant for lunch and then go back and look in a bit more detail at some of the classics. Although we didn‚Äôt eat, the food looked amazing and the cost seemed pretty reasonable.

The building doesn't look that big from the outside, but once you get inside you will be surprised at how much space there is. The building was originally built to house trains a long time ago so it is built in a semi circle and has two stories. The vehicles there range from old (50 years ago approx.) to new less than 3 - 5 years ago. Some cars are even for sale so you could drive one away today!!!! Whats even better though about this place is that it's free to enter!",
Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,Do you like classic cars? This is a find!,,
Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,Great if you enjoy looking at antique and beautiful cars,"If you enjoy looking at antique and high end cars, then this is a great attraction. Admission is free. The selection of cars is terrific - we saw many cars (especially some sports cars and antique cars) that we had never seen anywhere else. And for our kids - who had seen quite a few art museums and old churches during our trip - this was a nice change of pace. You need about 90 minutes to 2 hours to see everything. We also ate lunch at the restaurant inside the museum, which was quite good and reasonably priced.",
Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,Excellent - if a bit odd!,"As an owner of a classic car, I couldn't pass up the chance to visit Classic Remise particularly as it had good reviews on Tripadvisor.

It is part classic and modern car dealership, part repair workshop, part salesroom, and I think also part garaging space for top end sports and classic cars.

There are numerous makes of cars from Germany (BMWs, Audis/Auto Union, Mercedes, Porsche), USA (Cadillacs), Italy (Ferrari, Lamborghini) and Britain (Morgan).

It's free to enter and admire the multi-million pounds/Euros of cars on display.

There is a separate section for motorbikes, but seems to be mainly Vespas and modern bikes e.g. Ducati.

There are a couple of shops, one selling clothing and one selling books, memorabilia and parts for classic cars.

There's a cafe which serves decent food and drink too.

All in all a great way to spend an hour and a half or so if you're a petrolhead.",

Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,What a place!,"A very interesting place with many unusual cars. Many performance models, I‚Äôve never seen so many Ferrari‚Äôs and Porsche‚Äôs in one place. Fascinating to see the glass garages and what people own! Like window shopping down Bond Street! Talking of shopping, there were a couple of retail outlets within the Remise but they were pricey. Excellent restaurant/bar/cafe with a subsidiary located outside where a waiter cycles back into the main restaurant to collect the hot orders. Prices were reasonable for food. Unbelievably FREE to enter. If you like cars of any era, then do visit.

Pretty straightforward to get to. We took the subway U-Bahn U77 and U79 direction Holthausen and got off at Provinzialplatz. Look out for the ‚ÄúClassic Remise‚Äù signpost when you get off, pointing left down Harffstraste. It‚Äôs just a 10 min walk along this street and the Remise is on your left.

Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,Amazing mix of really cool cars,"Like it has been stated many times before this place is great. It rained all the way there and it was raining and cold outside during my visit but the Remise is warm and inviting with nobody pushing you along. The people inside are all there for the same reason and everyone is polite and generally in awe of the vehicles inside. It was Sunday so most shops are closed. The cafe was open and the food and desserts looked very good but I didn't partake since they don't accept credit cards. I am constantly amazed at how many places don't want my business because they only take cash. Sad but hey they must be making plenty of cash to turn people away. It didn't spoil my visit but if you want to partake then bring euros.
Great place and should be on the bucket list for all car lovers.",
Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,I'm not a car nut but this nearly made me one,"To be honest, the reason why I went here was the rating on TripAdvisor. I did not regret it though. It is located somewhat remote but still easy to reach with public transportation. (Btw. my bus did have a minor crash with another bus so I had to go the rest of the way on foot but hey, hopefully this is the exception)
The Remise is really for free and you don't have to feel like you swindle yourself into something. It is there to show off great cars / bikes and makes it money by selling them. When I was there most people present where tourists.

As I said, I don't know that much about cars but I really liked some of those on display. Most are rather old, but some are current models of super cars. The cheapest I saw was a Corvette for 30.000‚Ç¨, the most expensive was a Maserati for 740.000‚Ç¨. I liked the Corvette more but you probably have to pay the price difference at the next gas station.",
Germany,Classic Remise Dusseldorf,Classic cars galore,"So this classic car warehouse is a a great place to visit. A dream for car enthusiasts, but also fun for those not so fanatical, but like the look of classic cars restored to pristine condition.

You‚Äôre free to just roam around and appreciate the range they have on display. Or you can always buy one, if you‚Äôve got a good quantity of Euro‚Äôs burning a hole in your pocket!

Dinos are a favourite of mine, although the Ferrari 308 has always had a lure!

I‚Äôd settle for a vintage Alfa though!

There were very few older cars, and now we know where all the vintage 911s are!

As longtime Porsche owners, we were intrigued, and looked at the reviews and then the website.

We spent at least 1 1/2 hours there on our way into Dusseldorf. It was full of wonderful vintage cars in beautiful condition. There were only a few 356s, but very many older 911s of various colors, and even a 959 and a Porsche tractor.

When you're lucky, maybe there is a repair shop fixing some nice cars and you could watch them (from a distance). In nicer weather, the parking lot is also filled with nice cars as enthusiasts also like to meet up here.

Many cars are parked inside the large open area, they are all for sale and totally drool worthy! All along the perimeter there are stacks and stacks of classic and antique cars, motorcycles and even vespas all in glass cases so you can see the full car, on two floors. Depending on how in depth you want to discuss each and every automobile you can cruise through in an hour or be here for like EVER!
Towards the back of the building they have restoration shops and there are several 'guy' stores where you can pick up some automobile themed clothing.
If you have the money all the automobiles are for sale..just tell them Ragan and Steven sent you...they won't care.. but you can tell them anyways :)",

In my opinion it was pretty awesome experience for me as a car lover. And today's event - ""Oldtimers"", was awesome also. There war Oldmobiles, classic Dodge models, classic Mercedes models.... Just visit it and you won't regret.

When the visitor gets tired he can go outside the building for a coffee, sausages or a beer. It's nice and the people are kind and polite. I was able to get along with then in English without any problems.

There is also a restaurant inside the building with the view of the cars but I didn't try it. Above the restaurant is a second floor where the visitor could go and watch the cars from high.",

Germany,Main Tower,Still by far the observation deck in Frankfurt,"Opened in 2000, Main Tower is currently the fourth tallest skyscraper in Germany. What makes it special compared to other highrise buildings in the city, is that it has an observation deck at the top that is open to the public and offers great 360 degree views over the entire city.

As Frankfurt‚Äôs highest observation deck its views are unrivaled. However, the view towards the east (city center) will likely become quite a bit obstructed in the upcoming years with new skyscrapers being constructed close to the Main Tower.

For 7.50‚Ç¨ the entrance fee is a bargain compared with most other well-known observation decks around the world that often charge visitors between 20 and 40‚Ç¨.

What I also really like about this observation deck is the welcoming attitude towards photographers. Whereas tripods are banned at most observation decks, there is absolutely no problem whatsoever to take photos with a tripod here.

My favorite time to take the elevator up is about an hour before sunset. This way you can witness the sunset, the blue hour and the lights being switched on all over the city.",

It was a Saturday morning at 11 am and the queue was about 70 odd pax and it took 30-40 minutes to clear security check! All that for a 15-20 minutes viewing of a not so spectacular city of Frankfurt. Just blocks of buildings all round. Wouldn't have visited if there were better things to do in Frankfurt.,"Written September 27, 2019"
Germany,Main Tower,Something to do on a Monday morning!,"Only had the morning free before a flight home - on a Monday when most other attractions are closed. Made it for the Alte Oper and then walked a few hundred yards south.I must have missed the signage, because I went in via the tower's rear entrance. One of first in a 10:00 am - not too many people in queue - so one tip may be to get there early to avoid crowds (and there is a security frisk to get through) Reasonably priced for the experience offered. Lift up (and down) is fast and silent - no real sense of speed- so remember look at the speedometer! Views from top-level viewing platform are spectacular. I was lucky it was a clear sunny day. Took several photos which are now screensaver/background images on phone and PC. All in all, a visit to Main Tower is recommended",

Germany,Main Tower,Fun views,"If you want to get your bearings in the financial capitol of Germany, this would be the place to do it. You do get some spectacular views -- but Frankfurt's buildings, to me, aren't iconically -- German. So -- it wasn't that impressive to me. It really kind of compares to a medium to large city skyline in America. I would not do it again -- BUT it was probably worth doing once.","Written September 13, 2019"

You can see all the main Frankfurt sights, including the airport, stadium, old town and train stations. Boards with photos help with the orientation.

Germany,Main Tower,A Highlight for Every Frankfurt Explorer!,"An architectural masterpiece in the heart of Frankfurt's skyline, the Main Tower is one of the highest buildings in the city built in 3 years between 1996 and 1999. After a security check, we climbed to the top of this 56 stories 240-meter high (including the antenna) building taking a high-speed elevator moving at 4 to 7 meters/second (for the first 190 meters and walk the last 10) for an incomparable 360¬∫ view of the city. The Main Tower consists of two high-rise buildings that are interlinked with one another. One is square, 170 meters high and the other is a round building 200 meters high with non-reflective glass. Our visit was on a sunny day so we got an amazing view of Frankfurt. The. best time to visit and shoot from this location is sunset when the view is phenomenal giving you a unique experience. This high-rise building is particularly popular with the people of Frankfurt as well as the tourists. It is the only one in the city that has a publicly accessible viewing platform with a restaurant. To help the visitors in identifying the prominent buildings and other attractions around the city, there are 4 ‚Äòinformation boards‚Äô placed at four sides of the top floor with their names. For about 45 minutes it is worth visiting this Tower for a stunning experience.",

Germany,Main Tower,Overrated,"I usually rely on Rick Steves and Trip Advisor for my travel advice. This time I feel they both got it wrong.

First, the entrance is not easy to find. Second, the entry price is much too high (thankfully, we had purchased Frankfurt city passes for the day, so we each saved 20% on the admission). Third, there was a lengthy wait tome (about an hour). I won't complain about the security check, since it's sadly pretty standard these days, but you can't use the lavatory unless you've passed through security first (did I mention the one hour wait time?).

Despite all these drawbacks, by far the worst was the old woman at the reception desk selling tickets. What a sourpuss! How in the world is this lady still employed? She is literally the first impression of the building when visitors enter, and she creates quite a negative one with her poor attitude.

Last, if I may be blunt, the city of Frankfurt view from the observation deck is just ""okay."" Unlike a view of New York City from the Empire State Building observation deck, there is simply nothing particularly emblematic nor nostalgically recognizable that would make it worth the trouble to deal with the rude employees, overpriced tickets, excruciating wait, etc.

I'd give it a miss.","Written September 23, 2018"
Germany,Main Tower,Worth the time. No wait at all on Sunday morning,"I went up on a Sunday morning. There was no wait at that time and the view was outstanding. The informational placards were clearly marked and identified specific points of interest. The one disappointment was the lack of facilities at the top. There was one bathroom stall each for men and women. So, even if the crowd was sparse on a Sunday morning, there was still a long wait to use the only toilet.

My security check was super fast, nothing like an airport. Just put my bag there but did not have to take my notebook out or empty water bottles. :) Yes, it may take a bit for the elevator to come, maybe 5 minutes, but that was okay. I was the only person in the elevator. I stayed until around 20.20 taking pictures. It was a great timing because I could see both the city with sunlight and then in the dark. Ticket costed 5 euro as a student. At around 20 o'clock, it got a bit fuller, more people coming to see the sunset and the city in the dark. I would recommend it.",

Germany,Main Tower,Fabulous views!,"We took a trip up the Main Tower whilst recently in Frankfurt & were greatly impressed by the far-reaching, 360 degree views. At 240m (or 787 feet) tall, the Main Tower is Frankfurt's highest vantage point with its observation deck, which also has telescopes, on the 56th floor. The top floor is reached via a very quick lift which made our ears pop a bit!. Main Tower is also interesting because it is the first fully glazed skyscraper in Europe, so there are great views from all floors & lots of photo opportunities. The regular entry price is a reasonable 7.50 euros, & you will get a further 20% off if you have a valid Frankfurt card.",
Germany,Main Tower,Great for an overview of the city but...,"...not as great as I had wished.

In the height of the summer, and on a Saturday night, for a photography visit, the main tower is not the best place to be.

Sun sets around 9.55pm, and it never gets truly dark until well gone 11pm. Even then the light hue over the Hills means there is still plenty of light around.

Also, since Frankfurt city centre is effectively closed down on weekends, the lights in the buildings are off so he shoot doesn‚Äôt come across as well as originally thought.

Having said this, you can still get great shots of the river, it‚Äôs bridges, Frankfurt main station, the airport, the football stadium, and the Radio tower.

Oh, it does get very windy (and rather cold) so be prepared for this.

At ‚Ç¨7.50, it‚Äôs not an expensive visit and must be done for photographers. However, there are better views of the cityscape to be had from other parts of the city",

I asked for information, asked to pay separately and I did not have the choice. But this would have been fine if she had been nice. Not at all the case, she started to be very rude towards me and my family (with one kid in the group), she was ironic and symply gave an awful treatment to a client.

The main lift takes you up to the 54th floor at a speed of 19km/h, which I think for a lift was pretty impressive.

Once at the top, you have to take a second lift up one more floor, before walking the final part.

I was surprised when we got to the top that there was a covering of snow on the deck, as it hadn‚Äôt snowed for a few days. Once we got out into the open air, the snow started to gently fall.

The views across Frankfurt are stunning, it is well worth visiting the tower.",

Germany,Main Tower,A must see in Frankfurt,"This was one of the most breathtaking places I visited in Frankfurt. I believe I paid like ‚Ç¨7.50 for the entrance fee. For this, you ride the elevator to the top, which seems to max out at a climb rate of 18km/h but it is not at all noticeable that you have started to climb. This is certainly one of the smoothest elevator rides I have had and merely takes a matter of seconds for one to reach the top floor at 190m high. From there you climb a few steps, I think like one or two storeys high to get to the observation deck which allows an all-round view over Frankfurt with some signage indicating some of the main buildings in sight. It was a gloomy day when I visited and can only imagine how nice it must be on a clear day. It was still really nice though.

Germany,Altstadt,Medieval Old Town worth a few days during the Christmas season,"The Alstadt (Old Town) of Nuremberg is situated between the Nuremburg Hbf station in the south and the Nuremburg Castle in the north. The Pegnitz River cuts across the city centre dividing Alstadt into two districts, St. Sebaldus north of the river and St. Lorenz to the south. The Old Town dates back nearly a thousand years and is a medieval gem of a destination.

We recently spent 4 days in Nuremburg and enjoyed sightseeing and dining throughout Alstadt. Historic churches that we most liked where St. Lorenz, St. Sebaldus and Frauenkirche. Of the museums around the city centre, we most liked Stadtmuseum im Fembo-Haus (City Museum). Kaiserburg N√ºrnberg (Nuremburg Castle) was another attraction that we really liked.

Along with the Nuremburg Castle, the city wall of Nuremburg is an excellent medieval attraction. Numerous well preserved towers, city cates and walls can be viewed. Similarly, there are numerous medieval bridges which cross the Pegnitz River that we liked. Most enjoyed were Museumsbr√ºcke, Karlsbr√ºcke and Henkersteg.

Another aspect of Nuremburg that we enjoyed was seeing the numerous statues and monuments scattered around the city centre. These range from tradition equestrian and seated statues of historic figures from Nuremburg including the likes of Albrecht-D√ºrer, Peter Henlein (inventor of the clock watch) and Kaiser Wilhelm I. We also enjoyed seeing some of the abstract and contemporary monuments around the city including the likes of Ehekarussell, Narrenschiffbrunnen, Dudelsackpfeiferbrunnen and Der Hase.

Lastly, we benefited from visiting Nuremburg during the annual Christkindlesmarkt (Christmas Market) which starts at Hauptmarkt and spreads through much of Altstadt in most directions. We enjoyed trying local specialities including Nuremburg sausages, lebkuchen and gluhwein - most enjoyed was Feuerzangenbowle from the booth with the giant cauldron. The city was excellently decorated during December as well, it was incredibly festive for the Christmas season.

In the end, we very much enjoyed our holiday in Nuremburg's medieval old town. There is plenty to keep you busy for a few days and longer for those who enjoy leisurely travel and more comprehensive experiences in destinations visited.",

There are a plenty to see and feel. Some of them are above, but some secrets are well kept during centuries beneath the cobblestoned streets like WWII bunkers and beer cellars, especially in Sebald district of the Old Town Nuremberg.
The most famous tourist attractions are well maintained and offer great photo-shooting spots for your memorabilia.
The city, which is almost 1000 years old, has suffered heavy bombings during the WWII, in which more than 90% of the old town was destroyed. After the WWII the city has started to rebuild ruins, some of them more or less successful.
Nevetheless, the city has risen like a Phoenix from the ashes.
Some of the most important and well-known among them definitely are: Frauentor, Lorenzkirche, Huptmarkt with Frauenkirche and Sch√∂ner Brunnen, Altes Rathaus, Sebalduskirche and Kaiserburg.
Beside those mentioned, there are a lot more, like Fembo Haus (Nuremberg City Museum), Toy Museum, Spitlertorturm, German National Museum, Wei√üer Turm (White Tower), Jakobsplatz with two churches (St. Jakobs‚Äô Church and St. Elizabeth Church), Holy Spirit Hospital, Weinstadel, Unschlittplatz, St. Egidien Church, nearby Laufer Schlaglturm and many, many more.

Germany,Altstadt,Nuremberg's Old Town.,"Situated on the banks of the Pegnitz River in the Bavarian region of Middle Franconia, Nuremberg owed its rapid growth due to its location on the key trade routes from one side. And from the another side, to its close relations with Emperors' court. Presence of Imperial court, even if temporary, attracted commerce and trade and stood behind development of crafts and art. In 1219 Nuremberg was granted ""Great Letter of Freedom"" by Emperor Frederick II, including town rights, privilege of minting coins and independent customs policy, among the others. With that, city soon become one of the most important trade centre on route from Italy to Northern Europe. Following centuries brought with them even larger expansion. The end of 13th century was witness to combining northern and southern parts of the city. Golden Bull of Charles IV from 1356 named Nuremberg as the city where newly elected kings of Germany must hold their first Imperial Diet increasing further city's importance. And finally, Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg ordered that Imperial regalia shall be kept permanently in Nuremberg, where they remained until 18th century. The flourishing of the free city of Nuremberg wasn't even hampered by numerous wars of high Middle Ages, and its cultural flowering in 15th and 16th centuries made it a centre of Renaissance in Holy Roman Empire. It was only the wars of 17th and 18th centuries that brought about temporarily slow down to the city's development.19th century, after Napoleon's fall, brought with itself revival of trade and commerce that made once again city prosperous. In 20th century, after WWI and along with rise of NSDAP, came dark card in city's history, but there's plenty of books written about it. And that's all about Nuremberg's history in great short. But what is left from its history? Remarkably, a lot. The great part of its city walls has survived, along with towers and gates. In the northern part of the Old Town can be found medieval churches of St. Sebald, and Our Lady. Not so far from Church of Our Lady, and on the other side of the Hauptmarkt square there's iconic Gothic fountain of Schoner Brunnen. To the north - east of Renaissance Town Hall can be found Baroque Church of St. Egidien and Pellerhaus. Further to the north west, there's Imperial Castle, and to the south of it, and next to the little charming square there's Albrecht Durer's house. Just to mention few interesting buildings of this area. A stroll along city walls, and then down the river, took us to Weinstadel (The Wine Store) located next to the Pegnitz River. Truly picturesque place. In the southern part of the Old Town there's also, a lot to see. Domed St. Elisabeth Church, so called White Tower (no longer white, though), and on the other end of Karolinenstrasse can be found impressive St. Lorenz Church. Outside of the southern part city walls sits Neo - Baroque edifice of Nuremberg's Central Station. And around 4 km to the south east from train station there's infamous Kongresshalle where NSDAP held its rallies, but we didn't go there.",

Germany,Altstadt,Christmas Market time,"We stayed here for a night in December just to see the famous Christmas market. We had a very nice walk along the river that lead us right into the Altstadt where the Christmas Markets are. The main market in the Hauptmarkt is very large and very crowded. We also noticed that the prices here in Nuremberg are much higher for everything than in any of the other Christmas Markets we visited. However, it was certainly festive and there are several markets as you walk around the Altstadt. the neatest one being the Children's Christmas Market. It was different and nice. There are several very good restaurants within the Altstadt but make sure to have reservations made as they tend to fill up very fast as darkness falls. The Altstadt itself is very clean and well maintained and there were several bands and choirs singing during the day and as evening fell. I would recommend that you park somewhere outside the Altstadt and walk in. Much easier. The one problem we did encounter was that it was very difficult to find a public restroom. There are signs but there are very deceptive and following them will lead you in circles.","Written January 4, 2019"

Germany,Altstadt,Wonderful town especially at Christmas!,"Having had a brief taste of Nuremberg during a business trip I was keen to return with my wife to sample the Christmas markets. We visited in early December and stayed at the Le Meridian Grand Hotel, which is conveniently situated near the train station and just opposite one of the entrances to the old town. The town is steeped in history and gothic architecture, so visiting at any time of the year will provide an interesting short break, however visiting during the festive season to sample the Christmas markets adds another dimension. The Old Town is relatively compact and largely pedestrianised making it easy to explore the area. From our hotel it was a leisurely 10 minute walk past some impressive buildings, shops and eateries down towards the river and the Christmas markets (the main market in the square, a market specifically for children and an international market with stalls from around the world). Although very busy in the evenings, particularly at the weekend the general atmosphere was very friendly and relaxed. I recommend being in the square at midday at some point to witness the clockwork figures moving on the church tower as the bells ring out. The selection of goods in the market itself was amazing with a huge variety of unique hand made items - if you like Christmas save some space in your luggage for some incredible decorations and gifts! As you walk between the numerous stalls sampling of gluhwein and punsch, bratwurst and lebkuchen is highly recommended!
Apart from the Christmas festivities the Old Town has several museums that are of interest and a visit to the castle is worthwhile if you wish to learn more about the impressive history of Nuremberg. Although we did not partake ourselves, we noticed free walking tours in different languages were available and well attended.
There are numerous excellent dining options that get very busy at weekends and a reservation may be required to ensure a table at your preferred restaurant. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Nuremberg and are happy to recommend to others.","Written December 20, 2018"

Architecture and art, old and new are blended now in the area of ""Altstadt"" - or ""Old Town"". Such a great place to walk and get lost in the architecture and the historical places.
Location - the Old city center - a combination of pedestrian streets and squares. So you can park the car nearby and enjoy a longer or shorter walk. Also is accessible by subway - you have the subway station right at the beginning of Koenigstrasse. Also the main railway station is nearby so you can come from outside Nuremberg by train is perfectly fine.
Sights - to list a few :
- St. Lorenz Church - look up my other review on the church for more details
- ""Der Schoene Brunnen"" - the fountain of wishes , - for details same as above.
- ""Hauptmarkt"" - the main square and still a functional market place.
- Women's tower right at the beginning of Koenigstrasse.
Architecture - Gothic is dominant but also the other currents are represented.
Altstadt - is well preserved and very nicely restored after the destruction suffered in WWII - due to the bombing.
Squares, statues, churches, fountains, bridges , towers, buildings - a lot of spots to be discovered.
Most of the landmarks can be visited without paying and entrance fee - but for those you have to pay they take cash and/or credit card so is no trouble at all.
Also you will find here restaurants - some several hundreds of years old - souvenir shops and not only - if you are looking for shopping you can find also some opportunities.
Overall is just perfect to stroll on the streets and admire the ""Beauty"" of the place.
Enjoy the Altstadt - is an excellent all day activity.","Written November 1, 2018"

Germany,Altstadt,A charming area belying its dark past,"Visited as an overnight stay right in the centre of the old town. Everything very walkable right from the train station entrance into the old town with cafes, bars and the Karstadt with supermarket just a short stroll away.

Points of interest regarding Hitler's Nazi occupation are included but the appeal, beauty and earlier historic focus of the area is much more evident as you wander through the village squares, plazas and around the old town walls, tunnels, arches and tors. (gates)

We asked for the printed map of the town (available from our hotel) which highlighted many points to check within the old town for those keen enough to wander.

The charming streets and cobbled lanes up to the Kaisernburg Nuremburg (an old castle and grounds with beautiful 180 degree views over the city skyline) displayed the beauty of the old town and city in a previous era allowing the mind to wander as you look into the past.

I was particularly impressed by the magnificence of the baroque cathedrals and early Germanic styles of architecture, with some in various stages of restoration from medieval to post war era. A photographer's dream!

Day or night there is plenty to see with most areas well lit and cathedrals and churches of particular note.

NB As with most areas personal safety is always important so if wandering particularly at night be aware of your surroundings and stay to the lit areas as much as possible.

Also wear comfortable flat walking shoes as the cobblestones are sometimes uneven, the grade up to the castle is gently climbing on one side and fairly steep on the other. None of these streets are good for heels or stilettos!

Something here for everyone but history, Arts and culture buffs will particularly enjoy. A place of charm, beauty and definitely worthy of a visit for a few hours or much longer.",
Germany,Altstadt,A Great Place To Visit,"The old town is the best part of Nuremberg to visit - loaded with shops, cafes, bars and restaurants, and plenty of quaint old buildings and architecture. Bearing in mind that the city was badly destroyed in WWII, much of what you see has been rebuilt & restored. The main drag itself is a little over-commercialised for my taste, but if you dive off left and right it's a little more interesting.

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Antonio Vivaldi- A Mystical Musical Experience,"Writing this review is an absolute thrill and honor. Antonio had four other musicians performing with him for a crowd from the Viking River Cruise-Astrild ship. I wasn't sure what to expect until he led his crew into a classic composition that set the stage for what was about to happen throughout the balance of their concert.
I noticed something very different about Antonio and his crew, but couldn't put my find on it. Then, it became incredibly obvious as if some unseen spirit standing next to me turned on the lights. Antonio and most of his crew were not just playing the music....they were deep within the energy of perfectly balanced tones they were producing.
And, only one person seemed to have her eyes open reading her sheet music (the pianist). Everyone else seemed to have connected with one another perfectly.
This, in turn, provided a gift that I was not expecting. Decades ago, I had competed for a position as a teenager with Music Youth International based in Traverse City, MI. MYI sought the most talented young musicians in the USA each year and then when they were found, the perfectionists of MYI groomed them into some even better.
The lead master gave us all an example of what they were building towards by showing us all that you can, and must feel the music you are playing. It is a kind of meditational, spiritual experience. And, when you are successful in do this, you will find yourself merging as one with all of you collogues. The audience will at least sense this regardless of their background.
After the performance, I asked for permission to visit with Antonio and did my best to express my thoughts, my feelings, and deep appreciation for what he and his crew had accomplished.
To say the experience of being with them was unique is truly a gross understatement. If you choose to attend any of their concerts, you will be more than entertained!","Written October 27, 2019"

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Amazing place,,
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Great Palace and Museums,"The Zwinger is top notch, but let me do a little explaining first.

Unknown to me before our trip, Dresden was a city of great art and culture in the 1700s. The closest equivalent is maybe the Romanovs in Russia before the revolution. This palace is one of the great works of architecture destroyed in the bombing raids of December, 1945, but rebuilt once East Germany fell. The building is amazing architecturally, but also houses three museums, each worthwhile in its own right.

First, you can walk around for free and it's certainly worth the time.

There is an old masters museum, but it's being renovated. We had the bad luck to be there when almost none of the works were on display. If seeing the art is important to you, you'll want to check ahead (although there are other art museums in the city you can enjoy as well).

The other art museums are for porcelain and scientific instruments. The porcelain is beautiful and I'm saying that as someone who ordinarily isn't that impressed by it. The Soviet Army stole much of this, but it was later returned to the city in the late 1950s as a kind of peace offering to the citizens of East Germany. You can see both German and Russian numbers on many of the pieces.

The scientific instruments are really cool. If you're at all into astronomy look in particular at the instruments they used to track planets. The instruments are also very artistic in their own right. Take a look at the automaton bear while you are there - it's amazing what they could do with 18th century technology.

The separate residence palace is in another palace more or less across the street. That one contains attractions such as the Green Vault (old and new) and many other displays. It's easy to see them both on the same visit but the sheer amount of amazing stuff suggests that you see them on different days.

This is a great sight and a symbol of Dresden's rebirth following the massive WWII bombings.",
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,A must see when in Dresden!,"Zwinger contains three museums and beautiful gardens. The gardens and surrounding buildings are beautiful and you can climb the terraces for stunning views. All the museums contained interesting artifacts with info in both English and German. I'd highly recommend giving this a visit if you're in Dresden.

You can walk through the gardens and admire the buildings for free but you need to pay for admission for the museums; if you plan on going into the museums I would recommend the Dresden Pass which costs ‚Ç¨22 for the all museums in Zwinger and the Royal Palace (note the 'Old Green Vault' is not included in this). Plan for around half an hour to an hour if you are just walking around the gardens and around half a day or more if you plan to visit all the museums.","Written August 10, 2019"

Both are worth a visit, and the ticket to visit both costs around 12 euros. You also have the option to simply walk up to the second floor of the terrace to take some awesome photos instead.

There were a few renovations at the time of our visit, but we could still admire the buildings.

It is very crowded around lunch time, less at end of day. Plan accordingly. Early mornings should be the best time to visit, as it is always.

There are very nice views from the 2nd level terrase, being accessible from a few entrances.

The Nymps bath fountains were not in function when we visited, but still a nice area (behind the entry to the left if getting in by bridge door)

It is a free attraction in which you could expect to spend about 30 minutes (excluding visit to any of the museums inside the walls).","Written May 4, 2019"

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Porcelain Collection is Outstanding,"Obviously the Palace is a Dresden Icon to be put in your must see bucket list. It is an impressive building with 2 main collections: Old Masters paintings and the Porcelain Collection which was outstanding and my favorite. The paintings were subdivided into 2 sections one of which was the Renaissance collection which I found least Enjoyable as it had repetitious religious themes . How many pictures of Jesus, Mary and Joseph in Med-eval attire can you look at? And there were Many. In the old Masters I particularly enjoyed the pictures of Old Dresden.I was told that this was Dresden's main attraction but to be honest, The Residence was far more rewarding. The Zwinger
also contains a well stocked gift shop and book store.",

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Grand Baroque Palace with Unique Collections,"Taking a day trip to Dresden from Prague, the Zwinger wasn't our first choice of museums but it turned out to be our highlight of the day. The Royal Residence was closed for renovation and the Zwinger was our alternative to see Saxon heritage and treasures. The reconstructed complex is built in true extravagant Baroque style. The walk across the balconies is glorious even the dreary winter days. In saying that, I'm sure it would be even better in summer when the fountains are in full swing.

The three museums in the complex are all unique and has something that suit everyone's tastes. We spent the least time in the Old Master's Gallery. Whilst it is an extensive collection, we were spoilt by other great galleries across Europe. The Porcelain Collection is one of it kind. It brought us to a journey into the history of European porcelain from Augustus the Strong's far east collections to its development in Meissen. It was my first experience of a porcelain museum and it was fantastic. The Royal Cabinet of Mathematical and Physical Instruments is also fascinating with intricate clockwork and instruments. The museum is also really interactive so visitors can experience the development of science over the centuries. The Zwinger is a complex where you can spend hours at, whether to admire the Saxon collections or just enjoying the Baroque architecture - definitely one of the must dos of Dresden.",
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Breathtaking and well equipped for tourists. Must visit!,"I would advise not to bring a lot of stuff: big backpacks, suitcases, winter clothes. Lockers are relatively small and very secure. No selfie sticks allowed into the museums. However taking photos, in most galleries, is allowed. Ask stuff in-advance. When you are IN, try to get those electronic guides - very helpful and informative. You can find them right at the entrance to every museum. There are several museums. So some homework to be done beforehand to prioritize your visits. In general - must visit place. Especially paintings. Even for those who know nothing about paintings, like me. It is still amazing... timeless!","Written February 23, 2019"
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,A powerful statement,"This beautiful Baroque monument is in every art history book and like all of Dresden, it refers to the powerful reign of the Saxon dukes in the 18th century and their interest for not only collecting art but also attracting artists to work and for education. The collection of old masters is outstanding and presented in a way you can enjoy at ease- not too many spaces and floors.At the same time the completely rebuilt monument refers to the destruction of the city at the end of the Second World War, Dresden is still rebuilding its former grandeur and has remained somewhat silent, like you are thrown back in time. .",

Lots of sculpture to look at although it is not of the first quality.

Loverly to walk thru. Wish there were benches to set.
Wide and expansive, the gravel paths led you to the entrances of the collections that Augustus displayed there. For example: art paintings and porcelain. Appreciate the separateness because like the Green Vault, there is too much to take-in.

But this is only the latest of a long line of building that has occurred on this site over many hundreds of years. Visit the palace early in the day if you want to take good photos before the crowds arrive.,

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Stunning gardens,Stunning garden that is worth walking round. No entrance fee and a nice break from the hustle of Dresden.,
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Do not miss this magnificent Baroque architectural masterpiece,"Begun in 1707 and completed in 1728, the magnificent Zwinger is a baroque architectural masterpiece designed by Augustus the Strong's court architect Matthaus Poppelmann and decorated by the sculptor Balthasar Permoser and an army of artisans who fashioned the over the top ornamentation. With six linked pavilions, lawns, pools, fountains, and a massive courtyard you could easily spend hours, days, exploring the Zwinger Palace.
Do not miss the Glockenspiel pavilion which holds a carillon of 40 Meissen porcelain bells that ringevery fifteen minutes-on the day of our visit Vivaldi's Spring was the musical selection.
Take one of the wide staircases to the open second floor walkways for expansive views of the courtyard and up close looks at the carved garlands and statues.
The interiors of the Zwinger are no less fanciful. If you enjoy paintings visit theOld Masters Picture Gallery in the northwest corner of the complex as the collection is unsurpassed with Raphael,Vermeer,Rubens, Direr,Holbein, Titian, Rembrandt, Canaletto and on and on. The Porzellansammlung collection houses over 20,000pieces of Dresden, Meissen, Japanese, Chinese and Korean porcelain.

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,A Phoenix City,A city that has risen from the rubble. The Palace has been reconstructed into impressive buildings. The courtyard and fountains are impressive. There is much to explore at this location.,"Written July 8, 2018"
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Baroque architecture is eye candy. Other attractions clustered nearby makes for a packed day of sightseeing,"The site is impressive! The baroque architecture was ""in your face"" and eye candy for me. We took about 30 minutes to stroll around the immense courtyard to take photos of the appealing sculptures which were everywhere on the buildings - roofline, walls, gates, around windows, balustrades, columns, cornices, and fountains. These sculptures are of a whimsical nature - playful mythological characters and cute cherubs - no saints, religious figures, or even royals. It was designed to be a pleasure palace after all.

There are at least 3 entry/exit gates to the site. There is no admission charge to walk around the courtyard to see the exterior of the buildings. We used the Crown Gate so called because of its crown and other royal insignia piled over the archway. This entry crosses a moat (now filled with greenish water). There is no drawbridge apparatus though in the tower - just beautiful sculptures. The other access points are by Theaterplatz where the Semper Opera and Hofkirche can be seen and through the Bell Tower on Sophienstrasse to visit the Residenzschloss and the Furstenzug.

Immediately evident upon entering any of the site's 3 entrances, visitors see the layout. Four large corner buildings connected by lower wings surround a central courtyard filled with 4 patches of geometric lawn shapes and 4 fountains. All the buildings, their connecting wings, and entrance towers have repeated rows of arched windows and openings which make a strong statement. Unfortunately, the sandstone used in the reconstruction of these buildings is beginning to darken.

The courtyard on my visit contained no flowers - just geometric shapes of mown lawn surrounding the 4 fountains. Wide pathways, mainly fine gravel - no cobble stone here - divide the property into quarters with the 4 low, but wide, fountains placed at the center where the paths cross. Tubs of low growing trees similar to those found in Orangeries were placed in this area. This site lacks shade trees - little shade other than that provided by the buildings and no benches for lingering. On my visit, the single spouting fountains were turned off around 4 pm.

One outstanding structure was the bell tower, easily recognizable with its gold framed clock and rows of seemingly small white Meissen bells. With a zoom lens, one can see the Meissen trademark of the 2 blue crossed swords around the clock. Fittingly, the entry to the Porcelain collection is in that tower . Go up the stairs to buy the ticket (6E) and while you are up there, step outside on to the roof terrace for a walk around. This is the spot to take ""aerial"" photos of the site.

If you want to visit the 2 museums holding the collections of art and porcelain, be familiar with their location on the site in order to save time retracing steps as I didn't see large signs outside the buildings (for obvious reasons). While there is no charge to enter the grounds, the 2 museums do have an entry fee - the Porzellansammlung (6E) and the art gallery - the Gemaldegalerie. I visited the porcelain collection using up another half hour to admire the 2 collections of Meissen and blue and white Chinese porcelain. The museum is on one floor. This wing displaying this collection is lovely - full of light streaming through rows of arched floor to ceiling windows, white walls, and marble floor. If you want to see what the interiors of the buildings are like, pay the museum admission price.

Once at the Zwinger Palace, the other attractions are close by - the Semper Opera, the HofKirche, the Residenzschloss, and even the Frauenkirche further along Auguststrasse which also has the 24,000 tiled League of Prince - the Furstenzug. All great attractions for a packed day of sightseeing.","Written July 8, 2018"
Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,Party Place of the Royals,"A must see in Dresden, this is the former party palace for the king and his court.

Germany,The Dresden Zwinger,"Old Masters, bad presentation","New facilities, good layout, good standard of art works, CRANACH especially well represented. However, all is spoilt by small print labels, set so low you have to kneel to see the text, then, of course you upset the alarms because you have got too close! Then the old GDR scowl from the gallery guards creates a tense atmosphere. None of them acknowledged my comments about these signs, probably also not a lot of english is understood?
Also, many paintings are crammed in up to 5 meters up walls, and with varnished surfaces and high lighting these are almost impossible to see, unless you stand back 15 to 20 meters and loose details.

These are serious detractions and are easily addressed. Fixing the lighting will take money and time, but is worth attention as well.","Written July 4, 2018"

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Great day in Family,"We wanted to have a weekend break with our two kids from 4 and 11. We decided to visit Leipzig specifically because of its zoo. Compared to other top European zoo, we found that the 54‚Ç¨ family ticket was great value for money. We stayed from 9h30 to 17h30, almost from the opening to the closure. The kids enjoyed alternatively watching the animals and the playgrounds. For each playground, there is coffee place, snack or restaurant making the visit and a great experience for everyone.",
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,World class zoo but lots of inconsiderate visitors,"I have family in Leipzig and have been to the zoo many many times. It is one of the nicest zoos I know. The animals seem happy, the enclosures are fairly big (thus sometimes you won't be able to spot an animal but it's important to give them the option to hide so I don't mind that at all) and theres a large variety of animals you can observe.

This is the first time I have been to the zoo since Covid and it wasn't as great an experience as it used to be. Firstly, in order to comply with the 2G rule, visitors had to queue to show their Covid status. The queue outside followed the main road and it took us approximately 45 minutes to get to the entrance. That's 45 minutes standing next to a busy road with a fed up toddler. Lots of peoole around us were smoking which made the experience even worse. No one was keeping their distance either (mind you, we would have probably ended up in a queue up to the H√∂fe am Br√ºhl if people had kept their distance....).

By the time we made it to the entrance our son was quite fed up. I think it would have been better to introduce a system that allowed people to book an arrival slot, e.g. 9-10, 10-11, 11-12 etc. to avoid thhis ridiculous queue.

Once inside, people were not following the rules very well, especially when it comes to distancing. My son got pushed around quite a bit. We also visited one of the restaurants and I deeply regretted it later. It was the Marche next to the giraffe enclosure. It was madness. People were hopping all over the place and at the salad bar a lady got so close I was close to asking her to get me drink first, she was literally leaning on me. The food was mediocre but very expensive. I would definitely get fries or a Bratwurst from one of tye many huts next time.

The B√§renspielplatz was an absolute highlight for our son! He absolutely loved it.

In short, it is an amazing place, eell worth a visit but I think there were too many people,especially since everyone wanted to enter more or less around the same time.",
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,"Fine, not worth a special trip.","It‚Äôs a zoo, a typical zoo? I‚Äôm from Ireland and it is just as good as Dublin zoo. I don‚Äôt think it is worth ‚Ç¨22... a lot of the animals were impossible to spot when we went (morning into early afternoon).

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Overrated and expensive.,"There were simply too many visitors allowed into the zoo and crowds and long queues were formed everywhere where the animals were...not only that, there were very few animals to be seen in each category of animals...I've been to many zoos in the world..Singapore zoo, Prague zoo etc..the price person for this zoo is too expensive.","Written August 12, 2021"
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Worth the visit,"In my opinion the long journey to the Zoo Leipzig was definitely worth it.
Right at the entrance I was pleasantly surprised. We didn't have to queue, as it is often the case in the other large zoos. Moreover I also find the entrance fees to be rather reasonable.
A lot of the buildings and animal enclosures are from earlier times, but most of them are spacious. The zoo is divided into individual themed areas that are adventurous and authentically designed.
My highlights include the world's largest great ape enclosure (Pongoland), the Kiwara savannah and of course the enormous Gondwanaland. Where else can you find a real 1.5 hectare jungle with a large variety of animals in the middle of a huge city?
In Pongoland, which is one of the themed areas of the park, you can take part in a virtual safari and in Gondwanaland you should definitely not miss the boat tour.
Furthermore there are also many restaurants and small food stands where hunger can be satisfied at a fair price. The toilets are very clean and you can decide whether you want to pay to for using them.
In conclusion I do think that the Leipzig Zoo is worth every penny that you pay and is one of the most beautiful zoos that I have seen so far. I can definitely recommend the Zoo Leipzig.","Written May 19, 2021"
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Too crowded,"We loved the layout of the zoo, it was well thought out with a good selection of animals on show and good facilities.

As with most city zoos, space is at a premium, but this zoo is laid out well, the animals seem very happy, and there are multiple viewing opportunities at each exhibit. Nearly every single plaque is fully translated in English too, which is really great. Also, there are many Coronavirus precautions in place. Lots of sanitizing stations, and masks are required in all the buildings. Definitely a great way to spend the day! Highly recommended!!","Written July 31, 2020"
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Very friendly for humans and animals,"The park itself is located near to the center. It is tidy, clean and the animals have enough space to live their life. The variety is outstanding. They have so many different species. It really is a place where you must have been. Also good for kids but if they aren‚Äòt that willing to walk for long dinstances you better bring a buggy along. You could also rent a vehicle to pull them around through the park. I can highly recommend this place. But make sure you are there quite early. A face mask is recommended but not obliged. In the park and its different houses.",

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Good but shares the faults of all zoos,"After reading the reviews I had hoped this would be different.
I visited on a surprisingly warm dry day.
Gondwanaland is well presented and signposted. There are some quite big fish in relatively small tanks. These are found along the path leading to the main attraction which is the large tropical greenhouse. The space features animals from different continents and it's all well labelled. A few bats were flying around and landing in the trees. Other animals were in enclosures.
The rest of the zoo is more typical. There is a large great apes house with what appears to be moderate outdoor space. The tigers seem to be less fortunate and pace constantly with little distractions.
Because it was winter quite a few animals were not seen.
Although efforts have been made to increase enclosure space when all said it is a zoo and these wild animals have been caged.
There is a good select of eating areas as well as cafes and restaurants

(At least we weren't peed on, like the little girl ahead of us.) We passed on the Indiana Jones-style boat ride but it looked fun for the younger set.

There were lockers available to store anything you didn‚Äôt want to carry around for a euro which was refundable. Our favourite area was Pongoland watching the monkeys!

It's divided into themed areas such as Asia, Africa, Pongoland (home of the apes), and Gondwanaland (tropical rainforests from 3 continents), etc. Most enclosures resemble natural habitats where you can see different species living together.
For me,the most exciting of these areas was Gondwanaland (a rainforest under roof). You can take a boat tour on a jungle ""river"" or cross over a suspension bridge to a viewing platform above the canopy...a super cool experience.
Though the tickets are a bit expensive by American standards, a visit here is well worth the price. Additionally...the zoo has free wheelchair rental and just about everything is accessible.","Written April 23, 2019"

If you've young kids and live in or near Leipzig, a season ticket is well worth it so you don't feel you've got to stay the whole day. Sometimes we used to go just for the great, clean playgrounds! The only negatives are that it can get very crowded in the school holidays (no wonder as there are free tickets for holders of the Ferienpass!) and the food and drink are a little pricey and often ""not quite what you're looking for"" so you might like to take your own.

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,"Lovely, well designed zoo with mostly excellent enclosures","My wife and I visited the zoo predominantly to see the two Formosan (Chinese) Pangolins that are resident, the only two Pangolins in the whole of Europe. The Pangolins are in a small enclosure in the elephant house, and we were delighted to see them being very active. The best time to visit is a Monday as they get weighed, so it is a guaranteed sighting.

The zoo also has many other rare animals, such as Snow Leopards, which have a lovely enclosure in the Himalaya themed part of the zoo, (complete with Buddhist prayer flags...). Our other favourite zone was Gonwanaland, which was a large dome covering a rainforest set-up, which had various tropical birds, monkeys, Tapirs and bats. There is a boat trip round an artificial river (that costs an extra Euro or so, but was worth it to see the animals from a different perspective), and there are a couple of high walk ways too to give a birds-eye view over the vast enclosure.

Unlike most zoos, the quality of food available is exceptional too, with themed restaurants depending on which zone you are in. We ate in the Gonwanaland enclosure, and had a fantastic Asian broth and dumplings, which was cooked fresh in front of us - much better than the usual burger and chips fayre at most zoos, and very reasonably priced too.

The majority of the animals had excellent enclosures, although I would say the Hyena's one looked a little small and he was exhibiting quite stressed behaviour as a result, but on the whole it is one of the finest zoos I have ever been to.","Written November 12, 2018"

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,The animals are not in the cages at this zoo,"I went to this zoo after reading that was one of kind, modern and unique. Unfortunately there was some unpleasant situations that I did not expect when you visit a zoo. The worst was that everywhere I went there was people smoking! I can not understand how is this allowed at the zoo; for the sake of animals, children and cleanliness this is extremely inappropriate. The manner in which some children and public behave towards the areas where the animals are without a protective glass is disturbing: they shout and annoy the animals (there is signs saying DO NOT DO THIS but nobody to enforce them).
The idea to have thematic restaurants is a good one, however one of them is so big that seems that we are in a shopping mall and the beautiful giraffes, zebras and other fabulous animals are just nice background...not there to be appreciated, admired or with a bit of luck, learn something about them.
Many descriptions are only in german and one woman working at the jungle area was upset because I excuse myself ( in german) for not speaking german.
Sincerely, I did my best to learn and try to observe the animals, fish and birds and with a bit of patience and turn a blind eye on the obnoxious public could be a nice visit, but be warned.

Both indoor and outdoor environments are superbly designed with the animals' needs uppermost.

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Zoo visit on a wet Sunday,"I was sceptical about this zoo visit as I love all wildlife and animals in pens it doesn't sit easy with me. However my wife was keen to visit and it is very accessible being very close to the city centre (within walking distance of the Seaside Park Hotel). It was a revelation, as a layman, all the animals looked in good condition and what I saw of their enclosures appeared very interesting in layout and clean and all the animals looked relatively comfortable and well cared for.
There were large areas of the exhibits that were covered-over (stadium style) so you could wander around and keep relatively dry even on a rainy day as we experienced.
There were adequate toilet and welfare facilities and all were very clean, tidy and well-maintained. Restaurant areas were plentiful with wide and varied offerings. All in all a great place to visit.",
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,AMAZING,What can I say about this place it was brilliant!!! Very clean all the animals looked to be happy in large enclosures.

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Hated it,"I see a lot of positive reviews for this zoo and I hate to soil the party but I did not enjoy it at all.

It is expensive and the staff are not very friendly.

It is old-fashioned, and although I liked some of the quaint architectural details, I don't think the animals are well kept or in some cases happy. The fishing cat in particular was pacing obsessively, a sign of trauma. It needs a larger enclosure or to be moved to a better zoo. In general large carnivores need a lot more space than they have here.

The worst was the boat ride; it looks like somebody went to Disney and saw the idea of charging extra to sit in a pretend boat which then carries you down a pretend river. Disney does it a lot better and this was embarrassingly lame. There was almost nothing to see. Mainly a lot of old-fashioned screens.

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Very busy relefecting its popularity,"It was a saturaday and packed with people reflecting its popularity with locals and visitors. So many people it was hard to walk sometimes hard to see exhibits. Convenient to tram 12. Most people on tram were going to zoo. All the exhibits, Gondwanaland, Africa, etc.. wonderful.
Massive tropical greenhouse was very impressive but too little (no?) info on plants and birds there.
Really annoying is people smoking everywhere. Apart from smoke it was so crowded people were bumping into lit cigarettes and littering. Really should set aside smoking areas away fromm main areas and phase it out completely.","Written July 1, 2017"
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Expensive but well worth it,"This is rather pricey, but when you go inside and realise how vast the space is, and how many animals are present, you realise it is good value for money. In particular, very impressed at the indoor tropical environment that was bigger than I could ever imagine. A well maintained zoo.

The only downfall is that everywhere within the zoo, the food and drink prices are extortionate. On a very very hot day of 32 degrees, we were forced to pay 3 euros for a small bottle of water. This was my only complaint.

The giraffes were especially a highlight, because you were in such close open proximity to them. A great day out for the family - but bring drinks and snacks!","Written June 22, 2017"

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,A great day out - but just too much to see in a day!!,"We spent a whole day out yesterday at the Leipzig Zoo. It opens at 9am but we are not such early birds on a day off and arrived around 10.30am, eventually leaving around 5.15pm - so a big day out!

The entrance ticket isn't cheap (‚Ç¨21 per adult) so as a short term visitor we definitely felt like we wanted to squeeze as much as possible out of the day... But I think, to our detriment, perhaps we overdid it a bit initially and I ran out of stamina!

There are lots of advertised 'feeding times' for different groups of animals. We would definitely recommend trying to see as many of those as possible as the animals are definitely at their most lively at those points or even just after. The problem with that approach is that the site is so vast and the feeding times so frequent that it's impossible to see as many times as you'd like whilst also getting a good look at the exhibits in between. Perhaps if we were there from doors opening until the very end of the day, but that would have been 9 hours trekking around(!)

There was lots of little cafes, restaurants and snack places where we could have stopped and quite a few benches and seats where people were eating their picnics. (We munched on the hoof, as it were...)

I'd say that if you're a local, getting a year ticket would be the best thing to do. There's so much to see and you could come back again and again!! But as a visitor you don't have that option so we probably only got a really good look at 1/2 to max 2/3 of the creatures - and I felt pretty rushed at that!!

In the last area (Gondwana Land??) we took the boat trip in the hope of seeing some creatures without needing to do the big walk. It was good to have a sit down and nice and cool in the tunnel at the start of the ride, but otherwise it was disappointing for us - we hardly saw any creatures from the boat. Thankfully it wasn't that expensive (‚Ç¨1.50 each) and they were able to play the audio commentary in English for my husband, who has no German.

A particular highlight for us was seeing the pangolins. They are down in the basement of the elephant house. They are a totally unique creature and, in the wild, only live in Taiwan. They were amazing and so interesting - I won't even try and describe them!!","Written June 8, 2017"

We're from the States (whose playgrounds do not even compare to those in Europe), but live in and travel around Europe, so we've seen some good and great playgrounds. This one tops them all by a large margin. It has amazing, overhead, encased climbing tunnels leading to these amazing dragon (and other creature) climbing apparatuses - you have to see it to believe it!
I HIGHLY recommend a visit to this zoo if you visit Leipzig and have ""playground-age"" children.
They could spend HOURS in this playground. Oh, and there is a nice cafe right next to it, so parents can sit, eat, get coffee (and I think they sell beer). NO KIDDING: this playground is worth the price of admission to the zoo!

The zoo IS a little hard to find the entrance, especially when driving; we found the parking garage OK, but from there it was a mystery where the entrance was (it's across ; if you're not familiar with the area or - you know - a tourist, more signs would be helpful.","Written May 6, 2017"

The zoo is quite large and I would advise using the map to ensure you don't miss anything. It is very hot and cold going in and out of buildings so be prepared to take coats off and on a lot.
There are lots of animals to see and their habitats are generally well laid out with foliage and stuff to play with. Personally I thought some could be bigger. I would advise going slightly earlier or later to avoid the peak times as it can get very busy with people stopping in viewing areas. The ticket seller spoke English. There are plenty of cafes and places to sit in the zoo with toilets available. It also seemed very clean. There was a large gift shop at the exit as well.

The renovated exhibits, especially for the apes and African savanna animals are now large and heavily vegetated.

Their newest and most popular exhibit is Gondwanaland which is a tropical exhibit under a giant climate controlled dome that features a 13-minute educational boat ride, much like a theme park ride with a mixture of light, sound, audio visuals, live action, live plants and animals, accompanied by a narrative. It was very impressive. The rest of the exhibit has a selection of plants, animals and birds from the continents that made up Gondwanaland arranged along a set route that takes you up and down though out the exhibit ‚Äì which ever gives the best view of the animals on display. It took us over two hours to see this exhibit; it‚Äôs very impressive.

This is very informative and worth watching and listening even if there are a lot of people. We did the monkey feeding and the elefant bathing, both were really fun. The fish feeding is not that spectacular. Make sure you visit Gondwanaland, we did this at the end and even though we were hungry we enjoyed that artificial mosquito-free jungle.

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,A great day in the park,"I am zoology post graduate from Australia and we have plenty of unique fun to enjoy at home but I always visit the zoological gardens of major cities around the world because it's a great day out walking through plotted gardens viewing the exotic animals.

I was taken to Leipzig by my fianc√© and her family and I must admit that this zoo he never been on my radar unlike London San Diego Singapore etc.

The Leipzig zoo has a serious experience to offer you

1/ there is a massive environmentally controlled enclosure called Gondwanaland which is not only a more intimate way to see New world monkeys etc but the flora and waterways are amazing

2/ the Safari Savannah display is vast and a wide variety of plains type mammals and birds share it seamlessly.

3/ primate enclosures are highly and cleverly engineered with wide, open and high spaces for the various troops to live almost naturally

4/ the aquarium is impressive with its circular design allowing fish to almost race around you and eachother.

5/ and the highlight for me ........ BIG Tigers.
If you've only ever seen smaller tigers you just have to see these ones ... They are HUGE. Breathtaking!!!!

Ok the only other thing you really need to know is that the coffee is bad everywhere

I left the zoo highly impressed with the technical aspects of the animal husbandry and public display and felt proud of the Leipzig Zoo as an example of how to bring wildlife close to people and give them an appreciation of nature.

Highly recommended day out","Written July 30, 2016"
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Not worth visiting,"After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor we felt it was a 'must visit'. However we found the animal enclosures dated, too small, overgrown and not a pleasant environment for the animals. Especially shocking was the elephant enclosure with one elephant rocking as if it was totally stressed out or thoroughly bored. Some of the birds had very little area to fly, and most of the animal enclosures seemed empty as we failed miserably to find the listed animals. We would definitely say we had wasted the 37 euros we paid, done waste your money.","Written July 26, 2016"
Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Amazing place!,"Wow, this was really one of the best zoos we've been to. Huge place, and it really feels like you're visiting the animals on their turf.

Could not recommend it more, to fully appreciate you need at least one full day, we did it in half a day and that was pushing it.

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Initial Appearance Good,"The zoo car park was modern and well designed. We thought this theme would continue through into the Zoo. The entrance to the zoo was impressive and the day started well. The entrance fee was more than fair Euro 18.50 per adult. We headed for the Savannah to enjoy our breakfast on the balcony overlooking the giraffes, zebra, gazelles. Great experience.

Sadly, the zoo generally was unkempt . Although the theme was to be similar to a safari experience the areas around the fenced off areas looked neglected rather than naturally wild. The sea lions and penguin water areas were slimy green making it difficult to see them swim. This generally applied to most of the water areas and ponds. The grotto where the nocturnal animals are housed is very dark and unpleasant.

They are in the process of investing a lot to improve the Zoo. I hope that Disney won't influence the end result too much.

Still worth a trip if only for the breakfast overlooking the Savannah.","Written June 19, 2016"

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Have to visit in Leipzig!,"The Leipzig Zoo is one of the spot you have to visit, when you are in the area!
You can spend half a day in Godwana Land alone. The African area, where zebras, giraffes and ostriches run free is impressing. You really can get the idea of a stampede in steppe. One of the highlights is the lion, he reminds me of Alex the Lion from Madagascar. He sure knows how to pose!
The area of the primates is impressive too, although it gave me the creeps watching the chimpanzees.
The walkways, the surrounding, plants, buildings, everything is harmonious.
We have been there on a weekday (Wednesday in may), no holiday season.
A parking deck is available, but it‚Äôs better to by tramway line 20 or 24 from main station (Hauptbahnhof) to direction Gohlls-Nord, it‚Äôs just 3 Stations, so, even in walking distance from city centre. And the tram stop is directly in front of the zoo entrance.

The highlights were definitely Gondwanaland and Pongoland as to be expected as the newer exhibits. Pongoland was undoubtedly the best great ape enclosures we've ever seen and Gondwanaland was just out of this world, so so impressive.

The only thing we didn't like was the snow leopard enclosures. We were so surprised to see them in such a cramped space after being so impressed with everything else but then saw the large area currently being constructed for them so obviously just temporary.

I went one day because I had done everything else quicker than I expected. It's the first time ever I've stayed at a zoo from open till close........even the ""renowned"" San Diego zoo couldn't keep me for more than a few hours.

The layout of this zoo is brilliant. I was impressed by the size of the place, the number of animals, how good their enclosures were and in general how much space they had. The Gondwana land exhibit is exceptional (and in the middle of the January freeze a welcome relief.........even stripped down to just t-shirt (oh and pants of course)). I was disappointed when I saw the outdoor primate exhibits empty only to have that turn to astonishment when I found their winter quarters which they were absolutely loving. Think I spent just an hour in there alone (and is another area of reprieve from the cold). The resident cat in the indoor viewing area was pretty special too lol.

Price wise I think I only paid $16 Euros which is fantastic for everything that was there. Great range of souvenirs too which were actually (I thought) reasonably priced.",

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,Best Zoo Ever,"Going to echo the sentiments of others here and say that this is a MUST do when in Leipzig, even if you didn't come for it. I went one day because I had done everything else quicker than I expected. It's the first time ever I've stayed at a zoo from open till close........even the ""renowned"" San Diego zoo couldn't keep me for more than a few hours.

The layout of this zoo is brilliant. I was impressed by the size of the place, the number of animals, how good their enclosures were and in general how much space they had. The Gondwana land exhibit is exceptional (and in the middle of the January freeze a welcome relief.........even stripped down to just t-shirt (oh and pants of course)). I was disappointed when I saw the outdoor primate exhibits empty only to have that turn to astonishment when I found their winter quarters which they were absolutely loving. Think I spent just an hour in there alone (and is another area of reprieve from the cold). The resident cat in the indoor viewing area was pretty special too lol.

Price wise I think I only paid $16 Euros which is fantastic for everything that was there. Great range of souvenirs too which were actually (I thought) reasonably priced.",

Germany,Zoo Leipzig,More humans than animals,"Visited on a fine September Saturday afternoon and the zoo was inevitably very crowded. Most of the animals were wisely asleep. But good sightings of local people -- I assume they were mostly local as NB the museum *does not accept foreign credit cards* for its expensive entrance fees. No map was provided with the ticket, though some maps were on display in central areas. Felt shunted around in a bossy way, and confronted with endless food and drink stops, shops, etc. The monkey house (Pongoland?), which I remembered as stunning from last time, was particularly disappointing. Under 10 monkeys/orang utans were visible, rather than a entire community reacting off each other. If you like crowds of humans and a few sleeping animals, this is for you. However, on the plus side, the zoo seems very committed to educating its visitors about the animals and their care and chances of survival.","Written September 13, 2015"

Almost all the signs are in English next to the text in German, explanations are quite detailed and give a great commentary for a teen visitor.

The zoo is one of the biggest and best in europe and has recently opened a huge covered tropical glasshouse area that cost ‚Ç¨67million.
Its a modern zoo with lots of open space for the animals to live a close to natural life, without cages.
Many aquatic species are displayed artfully behind glass so that one can see them both above and below water.
The tropical area is best viewed first before the crowds build up and it is, of course, very hot and humid inside and even has a boat ride.
The great apes and great cats are displayed on naturalistic islands and all look content and unaffected by the small crowds of onlookers.
This zoo does seem to champion the lesser known animals too so expect to see some weird rodents and even a Pangolin.

Most of the compounds are huge and very diverse in landscaping (e.g. the islands, rivers and trees of the great apes or the large savanna compound).
For me especially the apes and the behavioral studies the conduct on them there were the most interesting as you seldomly get all the great apes together in one place (orang-utans, chimpanzees, gorillas and bonobos).
The rainforest globe was wunderful too (though the boat-tour was a little bit too ""Disney"" for me).

The dome i was most impressed with, it is however hot and humid in there so be aware if you don't like that. There is a boat ride around the dome, the animals are free to roam, there are lovely colourful birds flying around and you can do a tree top walk. There is also a gift and food shop\bar. The rest of the animals had large enclosures and looked pretty happy. The only disappointing thing was the elephants didn't look happy or look like they had enough room, but there is construction next to them so I hope it is an add on for them.

The indoor dome area is excellent but be prepared its very hot and humid and you will sweat. Clearly there is a very successful breeding program with a number of animals with young. On the Sunday I visited it was very very busy I think in part to the fact it was a very nice day and I queued for quite sometime for entrance only to discover I could have got in much quicker with some local knowledge.

The amount of different plants, the variety of animals, the number of cafes across the zoo was mesmerizing.

If you ever go there, leave enough time to do the mini boat trip in the last and the largest tropical area of the zoo. It's beautiful.

It was also unique to examine tropical plants and animal without being hassled by mosquitoes or other bugs! Leipzig Zoo is a genuinely unique place.","Written January 28, 2015"

Germany,Schnoor Viertel,Best Place to start your Bremen tour/visit!,"My wife and myself arrived in Bremerhaven yesterday morning aboard the Azamara Journey Cruise Ship and - together with some fellow passengers - spent the afternoon on a Walking Tour of nearby (55 kms away) Bremen.

In this regard, we were fortunate to have an excellent guide who suggested that the tour should start in the Schnoor District - Bremen‚Äôs oldest quarter less than 5 minutes walk from the main square.

This proved a good move setting the scene nicely for the rest of the tour which tool in the cathedral, City Hall and the riverside area. Schnoor is not huge but it is packed with history - meandering streets with half-timbered houses, many of which are now restaurants or shops.

All visitors are, therefore, strongly recommended to spend their first 30 minutes or so in the delightful Schnoor District.","Written September 5, 2018"

By the 1950s all rest of the building were in extremely bad shape, then the city decided to rebuild and restore this area. In 1973 it was designated a historic area. We enjoyed walking through this area, but the enjoyment was hampered by way too many tourists for these narrow streets to handle. On top of that there are tour groups in numbers up to 50 people each crowded together with a leader holding a flag or sign up high and speaking loudly. It is bad and a poorer experience because of this. I would recommend visiting here early in the morning and certainly before 10 am. After that it is too crazy.",

Germany,Schnoor Viertel,Winds its way into your heart,"We entered the Schnoor from the Marktplatz (after admiring the statue of Roland, the Rathaus (Town Hall), the statue that marks the place of the pre-Inquisition bath house -- fun and naughty, and the Dom (the Cathedral), and rubbing the nose of the donkey (the Musicians of Bremen statue) on a cold January evening. The Schnoor -- which means ""the Rope"" in German) -- is aptly named. Its accepted meaning derives from the houses strung together like beads on a string and, alternatively, the ropemakers' quarter. I missed the rest of the branches of the maze, so tell of what I saw.

The narrow, winding alley goes through the oldest part of Bremen where narrow half-timbered houses jostle and lean over you, spilling over with tiny shops stuffed with souvenirs, sweets -- where they were pulling taffy as we watched), ribbons and buttons, and Christmas decorations (it's open all year), handicrafts and herb teas and soaps, and more. We stopped at a kiosk selling gluhwein, and in the doorway across the lane (that is, six feet away) stood a man in medieval costume, holding a dead rat (okay, a very good imitation of one). Clearly advertising a performance within, but alas, we had not the time to stop and see. Of the several cafes, we visited one (the name of which escapes me, but is a huge, high-ceilinged place, very 1920s, the walls crammed with photographs of the dignitaries and celebrities who have all stopped by for a drink).

In places, the Schnoor is so narrow that you could touch the walls on both sides when you stretch your arms. A cluster of potted plants in a corner at one of the many bends of this crooked alley, curtains in the upstairs windows show that some lucky people live in this delightful piece of Bremen. One can go on to the Boetscherstrasse and the Paula Modersohn-Becker Museum (we could not, as it was too late, so consoled ourselves with shopping at the souvenir shop).

The trip was too short, and I longed to go back spend all day there. Now, the tradition is, if you rub the statue of the Bremen Musicians, you will return, So I am pretty sure I'll be back.","Written February 10, 2018"

A few nice things to do and see, and enjoy the view + there is a Michelin restaurant there (Scharff's).","Written September 13, 2020"
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Interesting castle with beautiful and varied view,"Nice walk upwards, the castle was built over a 200 year period, was destroyed and re-constructed in several spots, and is surrounded by a large park with modern statues. Because of covid 19, the guided tour of the interiors could not take place as usual, but the guide took us to exterior terraces, the main hall and chapel that are not normally accessible.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Varied visit,"Schloss Heidelberg is located on a hill, overlooking the river and part of the town. We drove up by car and parked near by. From the parking lot takes about 10/15 minutes. You'll pass through lovely gardens and are rewarded with gorgeous views. There is also a cable car, of which the fee is included in the castle entry ticket. Personally I don't know where the start and exit are located.

Entry tickets are 8 euros for adults and 4 for kids. When we were there, we were a bit confused though, because there were also signs saying that you could visit parts for free. Not sure about that... We just bought a ticket anyway.

The visit is varied. You'll be able to visit the courtyard, the big wine barrel, the apothecary museum, and two large balconies/gardens looking out over the town and river. I especially liked the museum, it was very informative and there were a lot of objects. There was loads to see. I especially liked the set ups of life-like apothecary shops.

We spend around 1,5 hours at seeing the things mentioned above. If you wish, you can also go on a tour of the inside of the castle. For this, you have to purchase an extra ticket. Part of the castle is in ruins, but the main body is still in use.

If you're in the area, it is definitely worth a visit, mostly because of the museum. Strictly looking at the architecture (on the outside), I didn't think it was the most beautiful castle that south-Germany has to offer though. So it really depends on what you're looking for!","Written August 18, 2020"
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,The landmark on the hill,"Heidelberg Castle is a good place to take a look.
The view from downward is also nice.
The best part for me was the wall with many different statues.","Written August 6, 2020"
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Amazing,The castle and surrounding grounds were amazing. Parts of the castle were closed due to COVID but well worth the visit. The town is so nice and inviting as well. Highly recommend it.,
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Certainly the highlight of Heidelberg and the dominant building of the old town,"Heidelberg Castle, even if partially a ruin, is the symbol of the city of Heidelberg. It stands imposingly slightly elevated and also offers a great view from the ""Old Bridge"" or the ""Philosopher's Walk"".
Heidelberg's trademark, the red sandstone - for sure, nice to look at!
Historically and visually interesting, even if today's view has nothing in common with the castle, which has been mentioned since the 12th century.

The castle can be reached either on foot, although the 80 meters in altitude from Necker / Altstadt become a bit tiring over time. Alternatively, you can take the historic cable car up from the Kornmarkt, or take the bus (line 20 / M5).

The castle from the outside with its gardens, the thick tower, or the Friedrichsbau is a worthwhile sight. Plus a good view of the old town.
It is worthwhile both during the day and in the evening when the spotlights hit the building.
You can take a tour of the castle, you don't have to. The ""big barrel"" is definitely a nice sight and a great photo opportunity. In return, I was disappointed with the pharmacy museum.

My conclusion: the castle is a must! Very nice during the day and in the evening / at night - also look at it from afar. The tour can be taken if there is enough time, it does not necessarily have to be.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Enjoy the view...,"Schloss Heidelberg is the main attraction of the city,and very well known,at least in Europe.It's very nice to look at it from Alte Br√ºcke,but it's worth visiting.We took the funicular 'cause entrance is close to the Marktplatz and easy to find and it was too hot to climb up.Castle is old,huge and impressive.It's ruined pretty much,but there are interesting things to see,including the biggest wine barrel in the world.Of course,the best of all is the view from the castle.I really enjoyed it.You can see old town and old bridge on the beautiful Neckar river.If I was a poet and if my English was better,I would describe it to you,but it's not the case.So,you have to believe me that the view is awsome,or even better,go and see for yourself.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Schloss at the Top,"One of the easiest and comfortable DIY Tours in Europe that we experienced was the tour of the Schloss Castle in Heidelberg. The self tour started at the square or the Altstadt then we took a short walk to the Funicular Station or the Lift Heidelberg Castle where we took a ride up to the Schloss Castle. It was fun for the family touring around a centuries old medieval structure. And yes, there is food and that was a big plus to kids.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Lots of tips and a warning,"First tip, park at Parkhaus Kornmarkt/Schloss. This garage is near to everything. From this parking garage you have a choice to go West into town, or walk up ""Kurzer Buckel,"" this is a paved pathway with lots of stairs straight up to Schloss/Heidelberg Castle. Be in shape, or take your time! There is a ""Mountain Cable Car Lift"" to the top, we didn't take that, but I'd highly recommend this for people who are out of shape. I bought the tour guide and entrance into the castle, it was pricey. Close to 80 ‚Ç¨ for nine of us. Just get the audio guide. I am not at all exaggerating when I tell you our guide ruined the castle for us. He was sarcastic, caustic and made fun of us tourists to pay to see a castle ruin that had nothing at all left worth seeing. Heidelberg, in general, is a lot like Kaiserslautern. I did not expect to see the flood of tourists overrunning these smaller towns. You will hear English being spoken everywhere.",

I definitely recommend purchasing the guided tour. We took an English tour and our guide was very knowledgable and provided great insights into the history of the castle. It was a small tour and we were able to ask questions easily. Many of the interior rooms have been completely restored and provide a beautiful glimpse into times gone by.

The grounds around the castle are quite vast and also provide a good opportunity for reflection during a leisurely walk.",

After the tour we checked out the permanent exhibition of pharmacy on site and the famous giant wine barrel. The views of Heidelberg from the gardens were gorgeous. I also liked that the plaques were not only in German but also English so it was very easy as a tourist to gather information. We could have got the return train down but happily walked 10 mins.

You can easily access the castle via a historical Zahnradbahn (cog railway) running in a tunnel system. Must sees are the Big Barrel which is as big as a small house, a great piece of craftsmanship. Also free with the combined access and cog railway ticket is the pharmacy museum which is actually much more interesting than it would seem at first site: It is a testimony to the very recent ultra-fast development of the pharmaceutical industry.

In order to access the inside of the castle you have to join a group and make sure you order a ticket before you enter the castle grounds proper. But be sure to mind the stairs, there are a lot.

We had an excellent guide who certainly knew the history. The castle itself is largely ruins and the only part we could go inside was a vault containing the world‚Äôs largest wine barrel.

We went up to the castle by coach, the road is very twisty and parking is a bit of a nightmare. I think there is a funicular or I suppose you could walk but that road is very steep.

It does get very crowded with lots of tour groups at the same time. The vault in particular gets crowded.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Castle Highlights & Ticket Tips,"We had a fabulous day trip to Heidelberg and the castle was definitely the ‚Äòdon‚Äôt miss‚Äô part of the trip.

CASTLE HIGHLIGHTS:
i) Getting off the funicular, the first part you see is the most ruined part. Head through the romantic gateway, ‚ÄòElisabethentor‚Äô. Freidrich V had it built as a birthday surprise for his wife, Elizabeth Stuart (daughter of James 1, king of England & Scotland). The biggest surprise is that he had it built in just one night.
ii) Look out for the tall round tower on your right. The toilet is built off to the side and opened onto the ground below (see photo). Apparently this was absolutely acceptable in those days and the ‚Äòcontents‚Äô fell down as fertiliser on the gardens underneath. It has to be said that the lawn below is very green.
iii) The path leads you around to Dicker Turm (the fat tower). Views from here are absolutely stunning. We stood here for ages just looking out across the town and river.
iv) The next section is through the courtyard and drawbridge (keep your ticket handy as you have to show it again here). Pass through the portcullis and under some pretty fearsome spikes. The courtyard area is much more intact and the huge pink stone walls of the 17th century residential palace are impressive.
v) Look out for a rare example of a vertical sun dial, with Roman numerals for the hours and astrological signs to show the time of year. It‚Äôs easily overlooked because it is high up on one of the walls.
vi) The Tun (world‚Äôs biggest wine keg) is down the ramp on your left. Entry is free with your castle ticket. It‚Äôs a bit of fun and a novelty to climb the stairs on to the top of it.
vii) Don't miss the Apothecary Museum. It might not sound like the most interesting museum in the world but it was fascinating & beautiful. I‚Äôm so pleased we didn't overlook it. It‚Äôs only small so a visit can be quite quick.
viii) There are more marvellous views again if you walk out past the museum. If you want to walk back down to town, the exit is here too or you can continue onto the castle‚Äôs terraced gardens. We skipped the gardens but only because we wanted to have time for the Philosopher‚Äôs Walk. We also decided to walk back down from this point, rather than wait for the funicular again. It was a quick and easy walk downhill.

TICKETS:
The castle, the barrel, the museum and the funicular are all included in your castle ticket (‚Ç¨8). You can be asked to show the ticket a number of times so its good to keep it handy. We didn't hire the audio guide. Information throughout the castle is good and signs are in English and German. Guided tours are extra but they can take you inside the castle. We didn't do the tour because the English tours are not that frequent. We found that there was plenty to see without doing the tour.

GETTING THERE:
The funicular is the quickest and easiest way up, especially as it‚Äôs included in your ticket. If the line is very long, you can walk. It‚Äôs a short walk (about 15 min) but very steep. You‚Äôll find the funicular and the ticket office behind Kornmarkt square. Look for the big pinkish coloured building with the sign ‚ÄòBergbahnen Heidelberg‚Äô. Enter through the doors under the sign ‚ÄòStation Kornmarkt‚Äô. We got there around midday and at that time we waited for about 30-40 minutes. A couple of hours later the line was much longer and was out the door and around the corner so I‚Äôd definitely recommend going earlier in the day if possible.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,The Schloss is well worth a visit-lovely.,"This is a beautiful, majestic castle, overlooking the city of Heidelberg.

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Romantic and Beautiful,I was stationed nearby some 25 or more years ago and the place really hasn't changed. Our children are now grown and my wife with her first time in Germany thoroughly enjoyed this scenic place. It inspires you to hold hands and take in all of the views. When you walk around the grounds and in and amongst the ruins you feel as though you were living in the 15th century. We would recommend spending several days here and in the city of Heidelberg.,
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Click worthy,"Saw this palace from our cruise on the Rhein river. It‚Äôs at a height above a cliff and quite spread across, although seemed very old and unpreserved.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,"Beautiful castle, but only outside","Poor tourist trap! The castle itself is beautiful, worth the visit and the walk around it, but not in the inside. Do not buy entrance!!
It takes not long to go up by feet. It's a little challenging if you are not fit but you can make several breaks (and trust me, rather this than standing hours in queue for the train, and paying..).

We were extremely disappointed paying 8 Euro each and then literally was nothing inside. Not even a nicer photo spot or historical exhibition. You can see no interiors, just a big barrel, an Apotheke museum (if you are interested, it's nice I guess) and the main point: restaurant and bar. Where tourists can pay more money.

So basically you pay an entrance fee for the opportunity to lay out additional money for expensive drinking and eating!

That's just a shame. You can just learn some history if you pay extra for a guided tour, which ofc is not mentioned at the ticket office (honestly I wouldn't even bother with this bc I'm pissed).

They should go to the Netherlands and learn how they manage the castles there!

And be prepared for the crowd of tourists!","Written November 3, 2019"

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Viking tour on the Rhine,"The 4th stop on our Viking cruise was in Heidelberg to tour the castle. Some of the footing from the bus parking area was rugged. But, it improved inside the castle grounds. It was amazing that such a large structure could be built in the 13th century. It was just as amazing that someone would destroy most of it in the 17th century.

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Photographically interesting castle above the town,"While abandoned three centuries ago, the castle ruins are an interesting subject for the photographer. Go early in the day to avoid crowds, especially on the tram access. Lighting was flat on the day of our visit, but the red brick walls give your pictures snap. We were with a cruise boat group, so my gear was simple: DSLR with zoom lens. Made adjustments to white balance as needed. In addition to walls there are viewpoints of the town and river. And do not forget the wine keg, largest in the world at 50,000 gallons.",

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Beautiful old German castle ruins,Just what you would imagine when you think about a old German castle.

House is the worlds largest beer keg Some places to eat and a fantastic new Heidelberg in the valley. You ride An incline tram up from the street and can go all the way to the top of the mountain if you desire. Nine euros includes the tram ride and admission to the courtyard. You can walk up 1000 steps to the castle but you still must pay the nine euros to go into the courtyard so your decision will be obvious. The area in the castle is set up to house special events. We could imagine weddings and large parties being held there.,"Written September 30, 2019"

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,A watchtower tuned fort turned castle !,"This is one of the artistic castle that I have seen. The history can be found in wiki. The amazing part of it is the different ages when they were build and how the generation of kingdoms build on the previous to get the castle to todays finish. Overlooking the town and river, this magnificent place is carved with amazing sculpture. Loved it from the time we entered the gates to the castle.

The best to do is buy the ticket that includes the entry to castle and also train ticket and the ticket to visit the top of the mountain to see the view of the city. This is going to be hassle free. The castle do have different sections which enlighten people on different generations of Pharmacy/medicinal research Germany has done right from Asprin to other innovations.

Advice: take some bottles of water, some food. There is huge garden to rest and spend some time. Ensure to be early as the place can get crowded.",

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,3rd Cousin (11X Removed) House,"I was excited (like a kid) to see the Schloss Heidelberg (Heidelberg Castle). Hard to believe but true, this was the home of my 3rd Cousin 11 Times Removed: Elizabeth of Bohemia Stewart (1596-1662), later known as The Winter Queen...the wife of King Frederick V von der Pfalz ""The Winter King"" (1596-1632) dubbed for his one winter reign in Austria. As Prince and Palatinate Elector here he supposedly had the ancient gate built for her in one night as her surprize birthday present! Likewise, seeing so many of the grand statues on the face of the main palace building that are identified great x grandfathers, like Emperor Charlemagne my 29th GGF, thrilled me. Definitely Recommended.",

Well done. The second - buy a funicular ticket for a ""short"" trip (that costs the same as the castle ticket, and... includes the admission to the castle). Do exactly what you would do should you go for the first option and then add wine barrel room, pharmacy museum and balcony views to the mix. No not miss the giant barrel, it is in the second room.

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Renaissance marvel atop the hill,"Heidelberg Castle, without a doubt, is the most famous landmark of the city. It represents one of the most important Renaissance structures north of the Alps.
It is located on the Schlossberg (Castle Hill), just above the Old Town and dates back to early XIII century.
First mention of the single castle on the hill was in 1214 and after 1294, when was the last time that the single castle was mentioned, there were two castles, lower and upper, which can be proofed by the document from 1303 in which is stated that there were lower castle, the site of today's Schloss Heidelberg on Jettenb√ºhl or Schlossberg and upper castle on Kleiner Gaisberg Mountain, near today's Hotel Molkenkur.
After 1294, there were two castles, lower - at the place of today‚Äôs site of Schloss Heidelberg at Schlossberg (Jettenb√ºhl) and upper - on Kleiner Gaisberg Mountain, near today‚Äôs hotel Hotel Molkenkur.
The first documented mention of this claim was in 1303.
The present structure had been expended by 1650, before the damage by later wars and fires. Maybe, the worst destruction of the castle was in 1689, when the French troops invaded Heidelberg and after a defeat and withdrawal from the city, they set a massive fire and blew up the front off the Fat Tower.
The castle was residence of many aristocrats from royal family and truly represents historical treasure, not only in Heidelberg itself, but in whole Germany.
Around the castle, there is beautiful garden and in front of the garden, there is Visitor Centre, which was made by famous Swiss architect Max Dudler.
In the castle itself, you can find a museum, German Pharmacy Museum and the most famous beer barrel Gro√ües Fass (Heidelberg Tun) with its magnificent 219.000 litres.
Today, the castle area is flocked by the tourists from many countries around the globe and estimated number of tourists per year is about three million of which the highest number comes from the USA and Japan.
If you are in a good shape, take a walk to the castle, which will take some twenty minutes or 1 steep km.
For the others, there is the famous steep railway, Bergbahn.
Absolutely must see and feel a brief history lesson of the city.",

Get there early as the tours into the castle closes at 16h00 and you can still walk around the castle grounds and enter the big wine barrel , you cannot enter the castle. It really is beautiful with stunning views from the top",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,"Lovely grounds, interesting castle","We should have given ourselves more time. I've heard the gardens are fabulous, but we weren't able to go see them. The world's largest wine cask is worth a photo op, and it's great that they offer tours of the castle in English. There is a fascinating exhibit of the history of German apothecaries. The tram ride up to the castle is included in the price of admission. We didn't know that, so we climbed the equivalent of 17 flights of stairs. Good workout. It made the view at the top breath-taking. Or maybe we were just out of breath. :)","Written July 16, 2019"
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,"Beautiful view, interesting ruin",The castle was destroyed by a fire and never rebuilt. What you see are the ruins. It also offers a beautiful view of the city.,
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Wow!,"This is a huge castle on top of the mountain and it overlooks beautiful Heidelberg, consequently, you can see the castle from many places in the town. It is beautiful to look at fromt he town and equally as beautiful to see the town from the castle grounds.

You can walk up (& down) or take a cable car. We took the cable car up, but walked down and it is a quiet little walk back to the town.

The castle is on beautiful grounds and there is a lot to see. Don't forget to check out the winery and the 2 large wine vats. The first one you see is huge, but wait... you see one even bigger with a dance floor on top. You can walk up there and dance too. It's not a big dance floor, but still impressive.

One of the cook things (we thought) was the sundial type clock on the side of the building (I will add a photo). It was not expensive and it was well worth seeing. You can do the simple tour or go more in depth and see more.

WHen you get done, go to the old bridge and look back up at the castle. Enjoy. It is must when in Heidelberg",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Beautiful palace & grounds,"Unfortunately we only had limited time to explore the palace and its grounds, because of the structure of a tour.

For those with more time to visit, I would recommend getting the funicular railway from the town to the palace; you need to this early in the morning or there will be a lot of waiting around. Our tour tried to book us tickets for this but because of the wait, we were taken in our coach to the palace entrance.","Written July 13, 2019"

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Schloss Brennerei Tegernsee Bavaria,"Beautiful restaurant, beautiful views, staff very friendly and nice..unfortunately waitress got the order wrong and I recieved a different meal than what I ordered, no big deal for me as both were beef based...I did feel the restaurant didn't handle it very well though as they asked me what we were going to do about the wrong order when I pointed it out!! As I was hungry and tired I said what they had given me was fine - and indeed it was very nice. But then when the bill came, the meal I recieved was more expensive than what I ordered - again the restaurant asked me what were we going to do about it, putting the onus on me !! Come on guys, it was your mistake so just cover the extra 4 euros !! As it was, I was on a short break and didn't want to start having an argument over 4 euros so paid the difference. For such a great place it seems a pity they messed up on handling their own mistake in a way without putting the customer in an embarrassing position.","Written July 10, 2019"
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Beautiful Castle and Garden,"This is a great castle to visit! Beautiful views and the Apotheke museum was very informative. The restaurant was affordable and you can't beat having lunch in a castle. The garden was beautiful. Don't waste your time with the audio(headphone)tour, the information was very limited.","Written July 9, 2019"

Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Neat historic castle,"Large castle, partly in ruins, that overlooks the city. Make sure to get the guided tour to ensure you see everything. Really cool wine tasting station in the basement and stunning views from the balcony.",
Germany,Schloss Heidelberg,Big climb but worth seeing,We were visiting a family member in Mannheim and took a day trip to Heidelberg. Very short train ride and then you take a short trolley ride over to old Heidelberg. The castle is a key visiting stop. Its a big climb and will take some people a while to make it up. Definitely wear good walking shoes for this paved climb up and bring water. Very much worth it to see this attraction- the ruins as well as the spectacular view. Actually great views and places to stop along the way,"Written July 6, 2019"
